turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .
ankara has been struggling with a reform process meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership .
turkish membership has proved a divisive issue among european politicians , with some wary of admitting the predominantly muslim country into a largely christian eu .
chancellor schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations and made a strong endorsement last november , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security .
german conservatives up in arms however , just this week germany ’ s opposition conservatives reiterated opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid as part of their campaign for june ’ s european parliament election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , parliamentary leader of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- told a party meeting this week that turkish membership in the eu would place too many demands on the eu ’ s ability to integrate new members and said they would make it an election issue , though " without any hint of xenophobia . "
glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .
schröder insisted that the opposite would be true if turkey , a secular muslim democracy and nato ally , were to gain eu entry .
erdogan to visit " little istanbul " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kreuzberg in addition to drumming up support for eu membership and meeting with high-ranking politicians , erdogan will visit berlin 's kreuzberg district , also known as " little istanbul " on account of its predominantly turkish population .
with its 126,000 turkish residents , berlin is home to the largest migrant group outside of turkey .
as the first turkish leader to visit the famed cultural melting pot , erdogan will also become the first turkish politician to officially call for the integration of turks in german society and urge them to fulfill their duties and responsibilities .
while touring the neighborhood , erdogan is scheduled to meet with turkish entrepreneurs and politicians as well as the berlin mayor .
mehpare bozyigit-kirchmann , director of tüsiad , the turkish industrialists ’ and businessmen ’ s association organizing erdogan ’ s berlin visit , said kreuzberg was selected because it didn ’ t just offer the dark side of immigration , but also its positive side visible in the lively coexistence of different cultures . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul blasts trigger debate about eu membership germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , parliamentary leader of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- told a party meeting this week that turkish membership in the eu would place too many demands on the eu ’ s ability to integrate new members and said they would make it an election issue , though " without any hint of xenophobia . "
glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .
schröder insisted that the opposite would be true if turkey , a secular muslim democracy and nato ally , were to gain eu entry .

turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .

drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .
but is this a giant leap or merely a baby step towards a greener future ? new european union guidelines that come into effect this year are aimed at having all fuels become a mixture of traditional non-renewable fuel sources and renewable , biological components by the end of 2005 .
previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .
but according to rainer winzenried of shell , consumers should n't set their hopes too high .
" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .
germany is the largest single biofuel producer , accounting for about 30 percent of all eu production . according to winzenried , german fuel sales reach about 53 million tons .
and while germany already produces large quantities of rapeseed oil for mixing into diesel fuel , some oil companies say there are n't sufficient quantities of ethanol , a grain product that could be added to benzine . the german automobile club adac is also warning that the biofuel label does n't mean that such fuels are totally environmentally-friendly .
" while biofuels certainly have advantages over conventional fuels in terms of the most common dangerous emissions , the emissions of the nitrogen oxides associated with biofuels are somewhat higher , " said adac spokesman peter hemschik . fuel of the future while problems remain , proponents of renewable energies say the eu directive is necessary to start the ball rolling towards a cleaner , emission-free future . " one of the hurdles is distribution - making the fuel or fuel blends as widely available as possible . another hurdle is producing sufficient quantities to support widespread distribution , " todd allmendinger , managing director of emerging energy research , told dw-world .

turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets . turkish-german business leaders had invited erdogan for breakfast at a penthouse apartment overlooking berlin ’ s kreuzberg district , but the turkish leader didn ’ t get to eat much as the room was too packed with people to get food to him . instead , he listened to germans talking about the integration of turkish people as well as turkey ’ s plans to join the eu and awaited his turn to speak . “ turkey has already decided in favor of the eu , ” erdogan then said , adding that about 75 percent of his countrymen were supportive of the plan .
“ we hope that by december we can set a date to commence admission talks . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit , left , and erdogan talk during the breakfast meeting .
referring to a recent debate in germany about turkey ’ s cultural differences that would prevent eu membership , erdogan admitted the road to eu admission would not be a smooth one . “ of course there are problems sometimes , ” he said , adding that he saw the union as a compromise of cultures .
“ but they also exist among current eu members .
you can only solve them through negotiations and we are convinced that we can do this . ” ankara has been struggling with reforms meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . solving the cyprus issue erdogan added that turkey would work on the issue of a possible reunification of cyprus .
should this not happen before may 1 , only the greek part of the mediterranean island will become one of 10 new eu member states on that date . “ the turkish side will take the necessary steps and we will definitely show our good will , ” he said .
“ but this good will has to come from both sides . ” some of those present said they saw erdogan ’ s visit to kreuzberg as a positive sign .
no turkish premier had ever visited the neighborhood , also known as “ little istanbul ” because of its large turkish population . “ it ’ s an appreciation of the turkish minority in germany , ” said kenan kolat , the vice president of the turkish community in germany , an organization which has about 200,000 members . bahattin kaya , president of an association of turkish-german business people in berlin and brandenburg , agreed that erdogan ’ s visit showed that he took the turkish community in germany seriously . “ but the people of kreuzberg didn ’ t get to see much of him , ” kaya said .
“ he should walk around and visit a market . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers arrest a left-wing demonstrator , who protested against erdogan 's visit in kreuzberg .
erdogan did manage to cram a brief hand-shaking session on the street into his schedule , however , some left-wing turks protested against his visit -lrb- photo -rrb- . and at a nearby outdoor market , many didn ’ t even know that turkey ’ s head of government had been around . mixed feelings on the street “ i ’ ve been living in berlin for 30 years , this is my home , ” said tanis gülr , who sells fruit and vegetables .
she added that she didn ’ t care much for politics . a few stalls down , 25-year-old hakan ünsal expressed his disappointment that erdogan hadn ’ t stopped by .
“ we ’ re happy he ’ s here , ” he said , wearing a turkish flag baseball cap .
“ but we would have been even happier if he ’ d come here . ” mukadder lusin göktas , who was visiting her husband ’ s jewelry store , saw things differently .
“ i ’ m not happy with him because he does nothing for the turks in germany , ” the 45-year-old said , adding that she often has to wait in line at the turkish consulate for hours to take care of paperwork . göktas , who has lived in germany for 25 years and is now a german citizen , also didn ’ t think much of erdogan ’ s plans to bring turkey into the eu . “ it ’ s already bad enough here , ” she said , adding that she ’ s unemployed and that her husband ’ s store will have to close because of bad business .

turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets . turkish-german business leaders had invited erdogan for breakfast at a penthouse apartment overlooking berlin ’ s kreuzberg district , but the turkish leader didn ’ t get to eat much as the room was too packed with people to get food to him . instead , he listened to germans talking about the integration of turkish people as well as turkey ’ s plans to join the eu and awaited his turn to speak . “ turkey has already decided in favor of the eu , ” erdogan then said , adding that about 75 percent of his countrymen were supportive of the plan .
“ we hope that by december we can set a date to commence admission talks . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit , left , and erdogan talk during the breakfast meeting .
referring to a recent debate in germany about turkey ’ s cultural differences that would prevent eu membership , erdogan admitted the road to eu admission would not be a smooth one . “ of course there are problems sometimes , ” he said , adding that he saw the union as a compromise of cultures .
“ but they also exist among current eu members .
you can only solve them through negotiations and we are convinced that we can do this . ” ankara has been struggling with reforms meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . solving the cyprus issue erdogan added that turkey would work on the issue of a possible reunification of cyprus .
should this not happen before may 1 , only the greek part of the mediterranean island will become one of 10 new eu member states on that date . “ the turkish side will take the necessary steps and we will definitely show our good will , ” he said .
“ but this good will has to come from both sides . ” some of those present said they saw erdogan ’ s visit to kreuzberg as a positive sign .
no turkish premier had ever visited the neighborhood , also known as “ little istanbul ” because of its large turkish population . “ it ’ s an appreciation of the turkish minority in germany , ” said kenan kolat , the vice president of the turkish community in germany , an organization which has about 200,000 members . bahattin kaya , president of an association of turkish-german business people in berlin and brandenburg , agreed that erdogan ’ s visit showed that he took the turkish community in germany seriously . “ but the people of kreuzberg didn ’ t get to see much of him , ” kaya said .
“ he should walk around and visit a market . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers arrest a left-wing demonstrator , who protested against erdogan 's visit in kreuzberg .

she added that she didn ’ t care much for politics . a few stalls down , 25-year-old hakan ünsal expressed his disappointment that erdogan hadn ’ t stopped by .
“ we ’ re happy he ’ s here , ” he said , wearing a turkish flag baseball cap .
“ but we would have been even happier if he ’ d come here . ” mukadder lusin göktas , who was visiting her husband ’ s jewelry store , saw things differently .
“ i ’ m not happy with him because he does nothing for the turks in germany , ” the 45-year-old said , adding that she often has to wait in line at the turkish consulate for hours to take care of paperwork . göktas , who has lived in germany for 25 years and is now a german citizen , also didn ’ t think much of erdogan ’ s plans to bring turkey into the eu . “ it ’ s already bad enough here , ” she said , adding that she ’ s unemployed and that her husband ’ s store will have to close because of bad business .
“ there ’ s 70 million people -lrb- in turkey -rrb- and they all want to get away from there . ” that ’ s not a typical standpoint , however , according to andreas goldberg , the executive director of the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university .

government spokesman bela anda , a former employee of the bild zeitung , agreed with vater that the paper had gone too far . schmidt 's ministry recently introduced health reforms that include unpopular measures such as reduced dental and eye coverage , as well as additional patient fees for doctor 's visits , medications , and hospital stays . more briefs 07.01.2004 -pipe- mars orbiter fails to contact landing unit 07.01.2004 -pipe- german farmer groups slam sloppy bse testing 07.01.2004 -pipe- federal criminal police to move to berlin 07.01.2004 -pipe- german conservatives rail against turkish eu membership 06.01.2004 -pipe- plan to create a ' german harvard ' sparks debate 06.01.2004 -pipe- global concert for world understanding 06.01.2004 -pipe- thomas cook refuses armed air marshals 06.01.2004 -pipe- deutsche post gives in to green pressure 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .
but before he can begin , the iranians must first finish clearing away the rubble . katrin matthaei -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rescue teams search for survivors at iran quake site international specialist rescue workers , among them germans , have reached the quake site in iran to search for survivors .

hundreds of cattle were slaughtered in germany in 2003 without undergoing bse testing , and now the european union is demanding answers .
meanwhile , the german government expects the number of untested cattle to rise . in germany , all cattle over 24 months in age are supposed to tested be for the deadly brain wasting disease bse , or bovine spongiform encephalopathy . but this week , officials in several german states admitted that authorities failed to conduct bse tests on over 600 cattle before they were slaughtered . now , the european commission wants answers . eu sources say that germany faces no immediate consequences for the breakdown in bse testing . " for now , we 're seeing this as an isolated incident , " an unnamed eu official told the german financial daily handelsblatt .

after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .
but before he can begin , the iranians must first finish clearing away the rubble . katrin matthaei -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rescue teams search for survivors at iran quake site international specialist rescue workers , among them germans , have reached the quake site in iran to search for survivors .

after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .
but before he can begin , the iranians must first finish clearing away the rubble . katrin matthaei -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rescue teams search for survivors at iran quake site international specialist rescue workers , among them germans , have reached the quake site in iran to search for survivors .

after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .
but before he can begin , the iranians must first finish clearing away the rubble . katrin matthaei -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rescue teams search for survivors at iran quake site international specialist rescue workers , among them germans , have reached the quake site in iran to search for survivors .

turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets . turkish-german business leaders had invited erdogan for breakfast at a penthouse apartment overlooking berlin ’ s kreuzberg district , but the turkish leader didn ’ t get to eat much as the room was too packed with people to get food to him . instead , he listened to germans talking about the integration of turkish people as well as turkey ’ s plans to join the eu and awaited his turn to speak . “ turkey has already decided in favor of the eu , ” erdogan then said , adding that about 75 percent of his countrymen were supportive of the plan .
“ we hope that by december we can set a date to commence admission talks . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit , left , and erdogan talk during the breakfast meeting .
referring to a recent debate in germany about turkey ’ s cultural differences that would prevent eu membership , erdogan admitted the road to eu admission would not be a smooth one . “ of course there are problems sometimes , ” he said , adding that he saw the union as a compromise of cultures .
“ but they also exist among current eu members .

“ but this good will has to come from both sides . ” some of those present said they saw erdogan ’ s visit to kreuzberg as a positive sign .
no turkish premier had ever visited the neighborhood , also known as “ little istanbul ” because of its large turkish population . “ it ’ s an appreciation of the turkish minority in germany , ” said kenan kolat , the vice president of the turkish community in germany , an organization which has about 200,000 members . bahattin kaya , president of an association of turkish-german business people in berlin and brandenburg , agreed that erdogan ’ s visit showed that he took the turkish community in germany seriously . “ but the people of kreuzberg didn ’ t get to see much of him , ” kaya said .

“ i ’ m not happy with him because he does nothing for the turks in germany , ” the 45-year-old said , adding that she often has to wait in line at the turkish consulate for hours to take care of paperwork . göktas , who has lived in germany for 25 years and is now a german citizen , also didn ’ t think much of erdogan ’ s plans to bring turkey into the eu . “ it ’ s already bad enough here , ” she said , adding that she ’ s unemployed and that her husband ’ s store will have to close because of bad business .

turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.01.2004 german expert wants to make iran quake-safe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can better adobe construction techniques help prevent another disaster ?
after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .
but before he can begin , the iranians must first finish clearing away the rubble . katrin matthaei -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rescue teams search for survivors at iran quake site international specialist rescue workers , among them germans , have reached the quake site in iran to search for survivors .

turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets . turkish-german business leaders had invited erdogan for breakfast at a penthouse apartment overlooking berlin ’ s kreuzberg district , but the turkish leader didn ’ t get to eat much as the room was too packed with people to get food to him . instead , he listened to germans talking about the integration of turkish people as well as turkey ’ s plans to join the eu and awaited his turn to speak . “ turkey has already decided in favor of the eu , ” erdogan then said , adding that about 75 percent of his countrymen were supportive of the plan .

after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .
but before he can begin , the iranians must first finish clearing away the rubble . katrin matthaei -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rescue teams search for survivors at iran quake site international specialist rescue workers , among them germans , have reached the quake site in iran to search for survivors .

turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets . turkish-german business leaders had invited erdogan for breakfast at a penthouse apartment overlooking berlin ’ s kreuzberg district , but the turkish leader didn ’ t get to eat much as the room was too packed with people to get food to him . instead , he listened to germans talking about the integration of turkish people as well as turkey ’ s plans to join the eu and awaited his turn to speak . “ turkey has already decided in favor of the eu , ” erdogan then said , adding that about 75 percent of his countrymen were supportive of the plan .
“ we hope that by december we can set a date to commence admission talks . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit , left , and erdogan talk during the breakfast meeting .
referring to a recent debate in germany about turkey ’ s cultural differences that would prevent eu membership , erdogan admitted the road to eu admission would not be a smooth one . “ of course there are problems sometimes , ” he said , adding that he saw the union as a compromise of cultures .
“ but they also exist among current eu members .
you can only solve them through negotiations and we are convinced that we can do this . ” ankara has been struggling with reforms meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .

brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . solving the cyprus issue erdogan added that turkey would work on the issue of a possible reunification of cyprus .
should this not happen before may 1 , only the greek part of the mediterranean island will become one of 10 new eu member states on that date . “ the turkish side will take the necessary steps and we will definitely show our good will , ” he said .
“ but this good will has to come from both sides . ” some of those present said they saw erdogan ’ s visit to kreuzberg as a positive sign .
no turkish premier had ever visited the neighborhood , also known as “ little istanbul ” because of its large turkish population . “ it ’ s an appreciation of the turkish minority in germany , ” said kenan kolat , the vice president of the turkish community in germany , an organization which has about 200,000 members . bahattin kaya , president of an association of turkish-german business people in berlin and brandenburg , agreed that erdogan ’ s visit showed that he took the turkish community in germany seriously . “ but the people of kreuzberg didn ’ t get to see much of him , ” kaya said .

“ there ’ s 70 million people -lrb- in turkey -rrb- and they all want to get away from there . ” that ’ s not a typical standpoint , however , according to andreas goldberg , the executive director of the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university .

discussions are underway between union and management , according to a company spokesman .
opel , a unit of general motors , originally cut the program because of cost concerns .
its about-face came because it sees the pension plan as necessary for recruiting the best workers .
the move contrasts with other german companies , which are canceling pension plans .

drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .
but is this a giant leap or merely a baby step towards a greener future ? new european union guidelines that come into effect this year are aimed at having all fuels become a mixture of traditional non-renewable fuel sources and renewable , biological components by the end of 2005 .
previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .
but according to rainer winzenried of shell , consumers should n't set their hopes too high .
" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .
germany is the largest single biofuel producer , accounting for about 30 percent of all eu production . according to winzenried , german fuel sales reach about 53 million tons .
and while germany already produces large quantities of rapeseed oil for mixing into diesel fuel , some oil companies say there are n't sufficient quantities of ethanol , a grain product that could be added to benzine . the german automobile club adac is also warning that the biofuel label does n't mean that such fuels are totally environmentally-friendly .
" while biofuels certainly have advantages over conventional fuels in terms of the most common dangerous emissions , the emissions of the nitrogen oxides associated with biofuels are somewhat higher , " said adac spokesman peter hemschik . fuel of the future while problems remain , proponents of renewable energies say the eu directive is necessary to start the ball rolling towards a cleaner , emission-free future . " one of the hurdles is distribution - making the fuel or fuel blends as widely available as possible . another hurdle is producing sufficient quantities to support widespread distribution , " todd allmendinger , managing director of emerging energy research , told dw-world .
" the eu directive will help push both forward .
it also raises awareness , and provides incentives for the auto industry , so overall , it could make higher targets much easier to reach in a shorter time frame , " he said . europeans can expect to start pumping the new biofuel mixtures in the first half of this year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iceland aims for oil-free energy hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .

glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .

but is this a giant leap or merely a baby step towards a greener future ? new european union guidelines that come into effect this year are aimed at having all fuels become a mixture of traditional non-renewable fuel sources and renewable , biological components by the end of 2005 .
previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .
but according to rainer winzenried of shell , consumers should n't set their hopes too high .
" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .
germany is the largest single biofuel producer , accounting for about 30 percent of all eu production . according to winzenried , german fuel sales reach about 53 million tons .
and while germany already produces large quantities of rapeseed oil for mixing into diesel fuel , some oil companies say there are n't sufficient quantities of ethanol , a grain product that could be added to benzine . the german automobile club adac is also warning that the biofuel label does n't mean that such fuels are totally environmentally-friendly .
" while biofuels certainly have advantages over conventional fuels in terms of the most common dangerous emissions , the emissions of the nitrogen oxides associated with biofuels are somewhat higher , " said adac spokesman peter hemschik . fuel of the future while problems remain , proponents of renewable energies say the eu directive is necessary to start the ball rolling towards a cleaner , emission-free future . " one of the hurdles is distribution - making the fuel or fuel blends as widely available as possible . another hurdle is producing sufficient quantities to support widespread distribution , " todd allmendinger , managing director of emerging energy research , told dw-world .
" the eu directive will help push both forward .
it also raises awareness , and provides incentives for the auto industry , so overall , it could make higher targets much easier to reach in a shorter time frame , " he said . europeans can expect to start pumping the new biofuel mixtures in the first half of this year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iceland aims for oil-free energy hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .

after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .
but before he can begin , the iranians must first finish clearing away the rubble . katrin matthaei -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rescue teams search for survivors at iran quake site international specialist rescue workers , among them germans , have reached the quake site in iran to search for survivors .

after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .
but before he can begin , the iranians must first finish clearing away the rubble . katrin matthaei -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rescue teams search for survivors at iran quake site international specialist rescue workers , among them germans , have reached the quake site in iran to search for survivors .

the dispute arose after the president of the world jewish congress , edgar bronfman , and the president of the european jewish congress , cobi benatoff , published a letter accusing the european commission of being anti-semitic .
the comments prompted commission president romano prodi to suspend preparations for a seminar on anti-semitism scheduled for february .

the meeting was described as " very friendly and fruitful " as both sides sought to play down the recent clash .
prodi is also expected to meet bronfman and benatoff in the next two weeks .
the commission president said the cooperation between the two institutions is " fully restored on the basis of a complete and mutual trust " and announced that the commission will resume its preparations for the seminar on anti-semitism .

turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets . turkish-german business leaders had invited erdogan for breakfast at a penthouse apartment overlooking berlin ’ s kreuzberg district , but the turkish leader didn ’ t get to eat much as the room was too packed with people to get food to him . instead , he listened to germans talking about the integration of turkish people as well as turkey ’ s plans to join the eu and awaited his turn to speak . “ turkey has already decided in favor of the eu , ” erdogan then said , adding that about 75 percent of his countrymen were supportive of the plan .
“ we hope that by december we can set a date to commence admission talks . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit , left , and erdogan talk during the breakfast meeting .
referring to a recent debate in germany about turkey ’ s cultural differences that would prevent eu membership , erdogan admitted the road to eu admission would not be a smooth one . “ of course there are problems sometimes , ” he said , adding that he saw the union as a compromise of cultures .
“ but they also exist among current eu members .
you can only solve them through negotiations and we are convinced that we can do this . ” ankara has been struggling with reforms meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . solving the cyprus issue erdogan added that turkey would work on the issue of a possible reunification of cyprus .
should this not happen before may 1 , only the greek part of the mediterranean island will become one of 10 new eu member states on that date . “ the turkish side will take the necessary steps and we will definitely show our good will , ” he said .
“ but this good will has to come from both sides . ” some of those present said they saw erdogan ’ s visit to kreuzberg as a positive sign .
no turkish premier had ever visited the neighborhood , also known as “ little istanbul ” because of its large turkish population . “ it ’ s an appreciation of the turkish minority in germany , ” said kenan kolat , the vice president of the turkish community in germany , an organization which has about 200,000 members . bahattin kaya , president of an association of turkish-german business people in berlin and brandenburg , agreed that erdogan ’ s visit showed that he took the turkish community in germany seriously . “ but the people of kreuzberg didn ’ t get to see much of him , ” kaya said .
“ he should walk around and visit a market . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers arrest a left-wing demonstrator , who protested against erdogan 's visit in kreuzberg .
erdogan did manage to cram a brief hand-shaking session on the street into his schedule , however , some left-wing turks protested against his visit -lrb- photo -rrb- . and at a nearby outdoor market , many didn ’ t even know that turkey ’ s head of government had been around . mixed feelings on the street “ i ’ ve been living in berlin for 30 years , this is my home , ” said tanis gülr , who sells fruit and vegetables .
she added that she didn ’ t care much for politics . a few stalls down , 25-year-old hakan ünsal expressed his disappointment that erdogan hadn ’ t stopped by .
“ we ’ re happy he ’ s here , ” he said , wearing a turkish flag baseball cap .
“ but we would have been even happier if he ’ d come here . ” mukadder lusin göktas , who was visiting her husband ’ s jewelry store , saw things differently .
“ i ’ m not happy with him because he does nothing for the turks in germany , ” the 45-year-old said , adding that she often has to wait in line at the turkish consulate for hours to take care of paperwork . göktas , who has lived in germany for 25 years and is now a german citizen , also didn ’ t think much of erdogan ’ s plans to bring turkey into the eu . “ it ’ s already bad enough here , ” she said , adding that she ’ s unemployed and that her husband ’ s store will have to close because of bad business .
“ there ’ s 70 million people -lrb- in turkey -rrb- and they all want to get away from there . ” that ’ s not a typical standpoint , however , according to andreas goldberg , the executive director of the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university .

drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .
but is this a giant leap or merely a baby step towards a greener future ? new european union guidelines that come into effect this year are aimed at having all fuels become a mixture of traditional non-renewable fuel sources and renewable , biological components by the end of 2005 .
previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .
but according to rainer winzenried of shell , consumers should n't set their hopes too high .
" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .
germany is the largest single biofuel producer , accounting for about 30 percent of all eu production . according to winzenried , german fuel sales reach about 53 million tons .
and while germany already produces large quantities of rapeseed oil for mixing into diesel fuel , some oil companies say there are n't sufficient quantities of ethanol , a grain product that could be added to benzine . the german automobile club adac is also warning that the biofuel label does n't mean that such fuels are totally environmentally-friendly .
" while biofuels certainly have advantages over conventional fuels in terms of the most common dangerous emissions , the emissions of the nitrogen oxides associated with biofuels are somewhat higher , " said adac spokesman peter hemschik . fuel of the future while problems remain , proponents of renewable energies say the eu directive is necessary to start the ball rolling towards a cleaner , emission-free future . " one of the hurdles is distribution - making the fuel or fuel blends as widely available as possible . another hurdle is producing sufficient quantities to support widespread distribution , " todd allmendinger , managing director of emerging energy research , told dw-world .
" the eu directive will help push both forward .
it also raises awareness , and provides incentives for the auto industry , so overall , it could make higher targets much easier to reach in a shorter time frame , " he said . europeans can expect to start pumping the new biofuel mixtures in the first half of this year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iceland aims for oil-free energy hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .

turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .
ankara has been struggling with a reform process meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership .
turkish membership has proved a divisive issue among european politicians , with some wary of admitting the predominantly muslim country into a largely christian eu .
chancellor schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations and made a strong endorsement last november , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security .
german conservatives up in arms however , just this week germany ’ s opposition conservatives reiterated opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid as part of their campaign for june ’ s european parliament election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , parliamentary leader of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- told a party meeting this week that turkish membership in the eu would place too many demands on the eu ’ s ability to integrate new members and said they would make it an election issue , though " without any hint of xenophobia . "
glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .
schröder insisted that the opposite would be true if turkey , a secular muslim democracy and nato ally , were to gain eu entry .
erdogan to visit " little istanbul " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kreuzberg in addition to drumming up support for eu membership and meeting with high-ranking politicians , erdogan will visit berlin 's kreuzberg district , also known as " little istanbul " on account of its predominantly turkish population .
with its 126,000 turkish residents , berlin is home to the largest migrant group outside of turkey .
as the first turkish leader to visit the famed cultural melting pot , erdogan will also become the first turkish politician to officially call for the integration of turks in german society and urge them to fulfill their duties and responsibilities .
while touring the neighborhood , erdogan is scheduled to meet with turkish entrepreneurs and politicians as well as the berlin mayor .
mehpare bozyigit-kirchmann , director of tüsiad , the turkish industrialists ’ and businessmen ’ s association organizing erdogan ’ s berlin visit , said kreuzberg was selected because it didn ’ t just offer the dark side of immigration , but also its positive side visible in the lively coexistence of different cultures . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul blasts trigger debate about eu membership germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .

previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .

the dispute arose after the president of the world jewish congress , edgar bronfman , and the president of the european jewish congress , cobi benatoff , published a letter accusing the european commission of being anti-semitic .
the comments prompted commission president romano prodi to suspend preparations for a seminar on anti-semitism scheduled for february .
but in an attempt to mend the rift , the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , flew overnight from new york to hold a meeting with prodi .
the meeting was described as " very friendly and fruitful " as both sides sought to play down the recent clash .
prodi is also expected to meet bronfman and benatoff in the next two weeks .
the commission president said the cooperation between the two institutions is " fully restored on the basis of a complete and mutual trust " and announced that the commission will resume its preparations for the seminar on anti-semitism .

drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .
but is this a giant leap or merely a baby step towards a greener future ? new european union guidelines that come into effect this year are aimed at having all fuels become a mixture of traditional non-renewable fuel sources and renewable , biological components by the end of 2005 .
previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .
but according to rainer winzenried of shell , consumers should n't set their hopes too high .
" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .
germany is the largest single biofuel producer , accounting for about 30 percent of all eu production . according to winzenried , german fuel sales reach about 53 million tons .
and while germany already produces large quantities of rapeseed oil for mixing into diesel fuel , some oil companies say there are n't sufficient quantities of ethanol , a grain product that could be added to benzine . the german automobile club adac is also warning that the biofuel label does n't mean that such fuels are totally environmentally-friendly .
" while biofuels certainly have advantages over conventional fuels in terms of the most common dangerous emissions , the emissions of the nitrogen oxides associated with biofuels are somewhat higher , " said adac spokesman peter hemschik . fuel of the future while problems remain , proponents of renewable energies say the eu directive is necessary to start the ball rolling towards a cleaner , emission-free future . " one of the hurdles is distribution - making the fuel or fuel blends as widely available as possible . another hurdle is producing sufficient quantities to support widespread distribution , " todd allmendinger , managing director of emerging energy research , told dw-world .
" the eu directive will help push both forward .
it also raises awareness , and provides incentives for the auto industry , so overall , it could make higher targets much easier to reach in a shorter time frame , " he said . europeans can expect to start pumping the new biofuel mixtures in the first half of this year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iceland aims for oil-free energy hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .

drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .
but is this a giant leap or merely a baby step towards a greener future ? new european union guidelines that come into effect this year are aimed at having all fuels become a mixture of traditional non-renewable fuel sources and renewable , biological components by the end of 2005 .
previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .
but according to rainer winzenried of shell , consumers should n't set their hopes too high .
" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .
germany is the largest single biofuel producer , accounting for about 30 percent of all eu production . according to winzenried , german fuel sales reach about 53 million tons .
and while germany already produces large quantities of rapeseed oil for mixing into diesel fuel , some oil companies say there are n't sufficient quantities of ethanol , a grain product that could be added to benzine . the german automobile club adac is also warning that the biofuel label does n't mean that such fuels are totally environmentally-friendly .

green party leader katrin göring-eckardt called for the change in an interview with the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel .
it followed the announcement of plans by the federal government to crack down on illegal workers .
göring-eckardt said new regulations for cleaning women were necessary because a large share of the illegal workers in german households come from eastern europe . dw-world.de hiring under the table could soon be criminal germans who hire cleaning women , carpenters or other handy workers off the books to work in their homes will have to shell out a fine of at least € 1500 in future , if investigators catch on to the deal , german business daily handelsblatt reported on friday .

turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .

brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership .
turkish membership has proved a divisive issue among european politicians , with some wary of admitting the predominantly muslim country into a largely christian eu .

schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.01.2004 green gasoline to debut in eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the chancellor 's doing it : pumping shell 's new biofuel .
drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .
but is this a giant leap or merely a baby step towards a greener future ? new european union guidelines that come into effect this year are aimed at having all fuels become a mixture of traditional non-renewable fuel sources and renewable , biological components by the end of 2005 .
previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .
but according to rainer winzenried of shell , consumers should n't set their hopes too high .
" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .
germany is the largest single biofuel producer , accounting for about 30 percent of all eu production . according to winzenried , german fuel sales reach about 53 million tons .
and while germany already produces large quantities of rapeseed oil for mixing into diesel fuel , some oil companies say there are n't sufficient quantities of ethanol , a grain product that could be added to benzine . the german automobile club adac is also warning that the biofuel label does n't mean that such fuels are totally environmentally-friendly .
" while biofuels certainly have advantages over conventional fuels in terms of the most common dangerous emissions , the emissions of the nitrogen oxides associated with biofuels are somewhat higher , " said adac spokesman peter hemschik . fuel of the future while problems remain , proponents of renewable energies say the eu directive is necessary to start the ball rolling towards a cleaner , emission-free future .

drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .
but is this a giant leap or merely a baby step towards a greener future ? new european union guidelines that come into effect this year are aimed at having all fuels become a mixture of traditional non-renewable fuel sources and renewable , biological components by the end of 2005 .
previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .
but according to rainer winzenried of shell , consumers should n't set their hopes too high .
" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .
germany is the largest single biofuel producer , accounting for about 30 percent of all eu production . according to winzenried , german fuel sales reach about 53 million tons .
and while germany already produces large quantities of rapeseed oil for mixing into diesel fuel , some oil companies say there are n't sufficient quantities of ethanol , a grain product that could be added to benzine . the german automobile club adac is also warning that the biofuel label does n't mean that such fuels are totally environmentally-friendly .
" while biofuels certainly have advantages over conventional fuels in terms of the most common dangerous emissions , the emissions of the nitrogen oxides associated with biofuels are somewhat higher , " said adac spokesman peter hemschik . fuel of the future while problems remain , proponents of renewable energies say the eu directive is necessary to start the ball rolling towards a cleaner , emission-free future . " one of the hurdles is distribution - making the fuel or fuel blends as widely available as possible . another hurdle is producing sufficient quantities to support widespread distribution , " todd allmendinger , managing director of emerging energy research , told dw-world .

turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .
ankara has been struggling with a reform process meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership .
turkish membership has proved a divisive issue among european politicians , with some wary of admitting the predominantly muslim country into a largely christian eu .
chancellor schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations and made a strong endorsement last november , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security .
german conservatives up in arms however , just this week germany ’ s opposition conservatives reiterated opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid as part of their campaign for june ’ s european parliament election .

"
glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .
schröder insisted that the opposite would be true if turkey , a secular muslim democracy and nato ally , were to gain eu entry .

with its 126,000 turkish residents , berlin is home to the largest migrant group outside of turkey .
as the first turkish leader to visit the famed cultural melting pot , erdogan will also become the first turkish politician to officially call for the integration of turks in german society and urge them to fulfill their duties and responsibilities .
while touring the neighborhood , erdogan is scheduled to meet with turkish entrepreneurs and politicians as well as the berlin mayor .
mehpare bozyigit-kirchmann , director of tüsiad , the turkish industrialists ’ and businessmen ’ s association organizing erdogan ’ s berlin visit , said kreuzberg was selected because it didn ’ t just offer the dark side of immigration , but also its positive side visible in the lively coexistence of different cultures . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul blasts trigger debate about eu membership germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .

green party leader katrin göring-eckardt called for the change in an interview with the berlin newspaper tagesspiegel .
it followed the announcement of plans by the federal government to crack down on illegal workers .
göring-eckardt said new regulations for cleaning women were necessary because a large share of the illegal workers in german households come from eastern europe . dw-world.de hiring under the table could soon be criminal germans who hire cleaning women , carpenters or other handy workers off the books to work in their homes will have to shell out a fine of at least € 1500 in future , if investigators catch on to the deal , german business daily handelsblatt reported on friday .

turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .
ankara has been struggling with a reform process meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership .
turkish membership has proved a divisive issue among european politicians , with some wary of admitting the predominantly muslim country into a largely christian eu .
chancellor schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations and made a strong endorsement last november , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security .
german conservatives up in arms however , just this week germany ’ s opposition conservatives reiterated opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid as part of their campaign for june ’ s european parliament election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , parliamentary leader of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- told a party meeting this week that turkish membership in the eu would place too many demands on the eu ’ s ability to integrate new members and said they would make it an election issue , though " without any hint of xenophobia . "
glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .
schröder insisted that the opposite would be true if turkey , a secular muslim democracy and nato ally , were to gain eu entry .
erdogan to visit " little istanbul " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kreuzberg in addition to drumming up support for eu membership and meeting with high-ranking politicians , erdogan will visit berlin 's kreuzberg district , also known as " little istanbul " on account of its predominantly turkish population .
with its 126,000 turkish residents , berlin is home to the largest migrant group outside of turkey .
as the first turkish leader to visit the famed cultural melting pot , erdogan will also become the first turkish politician to officially call for the integration of turks in german society and urge them to fulfill their duties and responsibilities .
while touring the neighborhood , erdogan is scheduled to meet with turkish entrepreneurs and politicians as well as the berlin mayor .
mehpare bozyigit-kirchmann , director of tüsiad , the turkish industrialists ’ and businessmen ’ s association organizing erdogan ’ s berlin visit , said kreuzberg was selected because it didn ’ t just offer the dark side of immigration , but also its positive side visible in the lively coexistence of different cultures . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul blasts trigger debate about eu membership germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .

the dispute arose after the president of the world jewish congress , edgar bronfman , and the president of the european jewish congress , cobi benatoff , published a letter accusing the european commission of being anti-semitic .
the comments prompted commission president romano prodi to suspend preparations for a seminar on anti-semitism scheduled for february .
but in an attempt to mend the rift , the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , flew overnight from new york to hold a meeting with prodi .
the meeting was described as " very friendly and fruitful " as both sides sought to play down the recent clash .
prodi is also expected to meet bronfman and benatoff in the next two weeks .
the commission president said the cooperation between the two institutions is " fully restored on the basis of a complete and mutual trust " and announced that the commission will resume its preparations for the seminar on anti-semitism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.01.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc anti-semitism talks to go ahead a bitter row between jewish leaders and the european commission seems to have been resolved , reopening the path for high level talks on anti-semitism in europe .
the dispute arose after the president of the world jewish congress , edgar bronfman , and the president of the european jewish congress , cobi benatoff , published a letter accusing the european commission of being anti-semitic .
the comments prompted commission president romano prodi to suspend preparations for a seminar on anti-semitism scheduled for february .
but in an attempt to mend the rift , the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , flew overnight from new york to hold a meeting with prodi .
the meeting was described as " very friendly and fruitful " as both sides sought to play down the recent clash .
prodi is also expected to meet bronfman and benatoff in the next two weeks .
the commission president said the cooperation between the two institutions is " fully restored on the basis of a complete and mutual trust " and announced that the commission will resume its preparations for the seminar on anti-semitism .

turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .
ankara has been struggling with a reform process meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership .
turkish membership has proved a divisive issue among european politicians , with some wary of admitting the predominantly muslim country into a largely christian eu .
chancellor schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations and made a strong endorsement last november , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security .
german conservatives up in arms however , just this week germany ’ s opposition conservatives reiterated opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid as part of their campaign for june ’ s european parliament election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , parliamentary leader of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- told a party meeting this week that turkish membership in the eu would place too many demands on the eu ’ s ability to integrate new members and said they would make it an election issue , though " without any hint of xenophobia . "
glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .
schröder insisted that the opposite would be true if turkey , a secular muslim democracy and nato ally , were to gain eu entry .
erdogan to visit " little istanbul " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kreuzberg in addition to drumming up support for eu membership and meeting with high-ranking politicians , erdogan will visit berlin 's kreuzberg district , also known as " little istanbul " on account of its predominantly turkish population .
with its 126,000 turkish residents , berlin is home to the largest migrant group outside of turkey .
as the first turkish leader to visit the famed cultural melting pot , erdogan will also become the first turkish politician to officially call for the integration of turks in german society and urge them to fulfill their duties and responsibilities .
while touring the neighborhood , erdogan is scheduled to meet with turkish entrepreneurs and politicians as well as the berlin mayor .
mehpare bozyigit-kirchmann , director of tüsiad , the turkish industrialists ’ and businessmen ’ s association organizing erdogan ’ s berlin visit , said kreuzberg was selected because it didn ’ t just offer the dark side of immigration , but also its positive side visible in the lively coexistence of different cultures . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul blasts trigger debate about eu membership germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .

turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .
ankara has been struggling with a reform process meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership .
turkish membership has proved a divisive issue among european politicians , with some wary of admitting the predominantly muslim country into a largely christian eu .
chancellor schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations and made a strong endorsement last november , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security .
german conservatives up in arms however , just this week germany ’ s opposition conservatives reiterated opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid as part of their campaign for june ’ s european parliament election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , parliamentary leader of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- told a party meeting this week that turkish membership in the eu would place too many demands on the eu ’ s ability to integrate new members and said they would make it an election issue , though " without any hint of xenophobia . "
glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .
schröder insisted that the opposite would be true if turkey , a secular muslim democracy and nato ally , were to gain eu entry .
erdogan to visit " little istanbul " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kreuzberg in addition to drumming up support for eu membership and meeting with high-ranking politicians , erdogan will visit berlin 's kreuzberg district , also known as " little istanbul " on account of its predominantly turkish population .
with its 126,000 turkish residents , berlin is home to the largest migrant group outside of turkey .
as the first turkish leader to visit the famed cultural melting pot , erdogan will also become the first turkish politician to officially call for the integration of turks in german society and urge them to fulfill their duties and responsibilities .
while touring the neighborhood , erdogan is scheduled to meet with turkish entrepreneurs and politicians as well as the berlin mayor .
mehpare bozyigit-kirchmann , director of tüsiad , the turkish industrialists ’ and businessmen ’ s association organizing erdogan ’ s berlin visit , said kreuzberg was selected because it didn ’ t just offer the dark side of immigration , but also its positive side visible in the lively coexistence of different cultures . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul blasts trigger debate about eu membership germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .

"
glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .
schröder insisted that the opposite would be true if turkey , a secular muslim democracy and nato ally , were to gain eu entry .

turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .

chancellor schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations and made a strong endorsement last november , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security .

turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .
ankara has been struggling with a reform process meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership .
turkish membership has proved a divisive issue among european politicians , with some wary of admitting the predominantly muslim country into a largely christian eu .
chancellor schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations and made a strong endorsement last november , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security .
german conservatives up in arms however , just this week germany ’ s opposition conservatives reiterated opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid as part of their campaign for june ’ s european parliament election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , parliamentary leader of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- told a party meeting this week that turkish membership in the eu would place too many demands on the eu ’ s ability to integrate new members and said they would make it an election issue , though " without any hint of xenophobia . "
glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .
schröder insisted that the opposite would be true if turkey , a secular muslim democracy and nato ally , were to gain eu entry .
erdogan to visit " little istanbul " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kreuzberg in addition to drumming up support for eu membership and meeting with high-ranking politicians , erdogan will visit berlin 's kreuzberg district , also known as " little istanbul " on account of its predominantly turkish population .
with its 126,000 turkish residents , berlin is home to the largest migrant group outside of turkey .
as the first turkish leader to visit the famed cultural melting pot , erdogan will also become the first turkish politician to officially call for the integration of turks in german society and urge them to fulfill their duties and responsibilities .
while touring the neighborhood , erdogan is scheduled to meet with turkish entrepreneurs and politicians as well as the berlin mayor .
mehpare bozyigit-kirchmann , director of tüsiad , the turkish industrialists ’ and businessmen ’ s association organizing erdogan ’ s berlin visit , said kreuzberg was selected because it didn ’ t just offer the dark side of immigration , but also its positive side visible in the lively coexistence of different cultures . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul blasts trigger debate about eu membership germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .
but the attacks have also ignited a fresh round of debate on turkey ’ s bid to join the eu .

21 , 2003 -rrb- turkey takes the cultural route to the eu turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations .

drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .
but is this a giant leap or merely a baby step towards a greener future ? new european union guidelines that come into effect this year are aimed at having all fuels become a mixture of traditional non-renewable fuel sources and renewable , biological components by the end of 2005 .
previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .
but according to rainer winzenried of shell , consumers should n't set their hopes too high .
" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .
germany is the largest single biofuel producer , accounting for about 30 percent of all eu production . according to winzenried , german fuel sales reach about 53 million tons .
and while germany already produces large quantities of rapeseed oil for mixing into diesel fuel , some oil companies say there are n't sufficient quantities of ethanol , a grain product that could be added to benzine . the german automobile club adac is also warning that the biofuel label does n't mean that such fuels are totally environmentally-friendly .
" while biofuels certainly have advantages over conventional fuels in terms of the most common dangerous emissions , the emissions of the nitrogen oxides associated with biofuels are somewhat higher , " said adac spokesman peter hemschik . fuel of the future while problems remain , proponents of renewable energies say the eu directive is necessary to start the ball rolling towards a cleaner , emission-free future . " one of the hurdles is distribution - making the fuel or fuel blends as widely available as possible . another hurdle is producing sufficient quantities to support widespread distribution , " todd allmendinger , managing director of emerging energy research , told dw-world .
" the eu directive will help push both forward .
it also raises awareness , and provides incentives for the auto industry , so overall , it could make higher targets much easier to reach in a shorter time frame , " he said . europeans can expect to start pumping the new biofuel mixtures in the first half of this year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iceland aims for oil-free energy hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .

previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .

" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .
germany is the largest single biofuel producer , accounting for about 30 percent of all eu production . according to winzenried , german fuel sales reach about 53 million tons .
and while germany already produces large quantities of rapeseed oil for mixing into diesel fuel , some oil companies say there are n't sufficient quantities of ethanol , a grain product that could be added to benzine . the german automobile club adac is also warning that the biofuel label does n't mean that such fuels are totally environmentally-friendly .

turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets . turkish-german business leaders had invited erdogan for breakfast at a penthouse apartment overlooking berlin ’ s kreuzberg district , but the turkish leader didn ’ t get to eat much as the room was too packed with people to get food to him . instead , he listened to germans talking about the integration of turkish people as well as turkey ’ s plans to join the eu and awaited his turn to speak . “ turkey has already decided in favor of the eu , ” erdogan then said , adding that about 75 percent of his countrymen were supportive of the plan .
“ we hope that by december we can set a date to commence admission talks . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit , left , and erdogan talk during the breakfast meeting .
referring to a recent debate in germany about turkey ’ s cultural differences that would prevent eu membership , erdogan admitted the road to eu admission would not be a smooth one . “ of course there are problems sometimes , ” he said , adding that he saw the union as a compromise of cultures .
“ but they also exist among current eu members .

should this not happen before may 1 , only the greek part of the mediterranean island will become one of 10 new eu member states on that date . “ the turkish side will take the necessary steps and we will definitely show our good will , ” he said .
“ but this good will has to come from both sides . ” some of those present said they saw erdogan ’ s visit to kreuzberg as a positive sign .
no turkish premier had ever visited the neighborhood , also known as “ little istanbul ” because of its large turkish population . “ it ’ s an appreciation of the turkish minority in germany , ” said kenan kolat , the vice president of the turkish community in germany , an organization which has about 200,000 members . bahattin kaya , president of an association of turkish-german business people in berlin and brandenburg , agreed that erdogan ’ s visit showed that he took the turkish community in germany seriously . “ but the people of kreuzberg didn ’ t get to see much of him , ” kaya said .

“ we ’ re happy he ’ s here , ” he said , wearing a turkish flag baseball cap .
“ but we would have been even happier if he ’ d come here . ” mukadder lusin göktas , who was visiting her husband ’ s jewelry store , saw things differently .
“ i ’ m not happy with him because he does nothing for the turks in germany , ” the 45-year-old said , adding that she often has to wait in line at the turkish consulate for hours to take care of paperwork . göktas , who has lived in germany for 25 years and is now a german citizen , also didn ’ t think much of erdogan ’ s plans to bring turkey into the eu . “ it ’ s already bad enough here , ” she said , adding that she ’ s unemployed and that her husband ’ s store will have to close because of bad business .
“ there ’ s 70 million people -lrb- in turkey -rrb- and they all want to get away from there . ” that ’ s not a typical standpoint , however , according to andreas goldberg , the executive director of the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university .

turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets . turkish-german business leaders had invited erdogan for breakfast at a penthouse apartment overlooking berlin ’ s kreuzberg district , but the turkish leader didn ’ t get to eat much as the room was too packed with people to get food to him . instead , he listened to germans talking about the integration of turkish people as well as turkey ’ s plans to join the eu and awaited his turn to speak . “ turkey has already decided in favor of the eu , ” erdogan then said , adding that about 75 percent of his countrymen were supportive of the plan .
“ we hope that by december we can set a date to commence admission talks . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit , left , and erdogan talk during the breakfast meeting .
referring to a recent debate in germany about turkey ’ s cultural differences that would prevent eu membership , erdogan admitted the road to eu admission would not be a smooth one . “ of course there are problems sometimes , ” he said , adding that he saw the union as a compromise of cultures .
“ but they also exist among current eu members .
you can only solve them through negotiations and we are convinced that we can do this . ” ankara has been struggling with reforms meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . solving the cyprus issue erdogan added that turkey would work on the issue of a possible reunification of cyprus .
should this not happen before may 1 , only the greek part of the mediterranean island will become one of 10 new eu member states on that date . “ the turkish side will take the necessary steps and we will definitely show our good will , ” he said .
“ but this good will has to come from both sides . ” some of those present said they saw erdogan ’ s visit to kreuzberg as a positive sign .
no turkish premier had ever visited the neighborhood , also known as “ little istanbul ” because of its large turkish population . “ it ’ s an appreciation of the turkish minority in germany , ” said kenan kolat , the vice president of the turkish community in germany , an organization which has about 200,000 members . bahattin kaya , president of an association of turkish-german business people in berlin and brandenburg , agreed that erdogan ’ s visit showed that he took the turkish community in germany seriously . “ but the people of kreuzberg didn ’ t get to see much of him , ” kaya said .
“ he should walk around and visit a market . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers arrest a left-wing demonstrator , who protested against erdogan 's visit in kreuzberg .
erdogan did manage to cram a brief hand-shaking session on the street into his schedule , however , some left-wing turks protested against his visit -lrb- photo -rrb- . and at a nearby outdoor market , many didn ’ t even know that turkey ’ s head of government had been around . mixed feelings on the street “ i ’ ve been living in berlin for 30 years , this is my home , ” said tanis gülr , who sells fruit and vegetables .
she added that she didn ’ t care much for politics . a few stalls down , 25-year-old hakan ünsal expressed his disappointment that erdogan hadn ’ t stopped by .
“ we ’ re happy he ’ s here , ” he said , wearing a turkish flag baseball cap .
“ but we would have been even happier if he ’ d come here . ” mukadder lusin göktas , who was visiting her husband ’ s jewelry store , saw things differently .

some of the letters contained messages such as " you 're making us sick , " and " you belong in the gas chamber . "
they were passed on to the federal bureau of investigation , which says it has identified the guilty party . schmidt 's spokesman , klaus vater , said the letters began arriving after the tabloid bild zeitung ran a headline that read " ms. minister , you 're making us sick . "
government spokesman bela anda , a former employee of the bild zeitung , agreed with vater that the paper had gone too far . schmidt 's ministry recently introduced health reforms that include unpopular measures such as reduced dental and eye coverage , as well as additional patient fees for doctor 's visits , medications , and hospital stays . more briefs 07.01.2004 -pipe- mars orbiter fails to contact landing unit 07.01.2004 -pipe- german farmer groups slam sloppy bse testing 07.01.2004 -pipe- federal criminal police to move to berlin 07.01.2004 -pipe- german conservatives rail against turkish eu membership 06.01.2004 -pipe- plan to create a ' german harvard ' sparks debate 06.01.2004 -pipe- global concert for world understanding 06.01.2004 -pipe- thomas cook refuses armed air marshals 06.01.2004 -pipe- deutsche post gives in to green pressure 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .
but before he can begin , the iranians must first finish clearing away the rubble . katrin matthaei -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rescue teams search for survivors at iran quake site international specialist rescue workers , among them germans , have reached the quake site in iran to search for survivors .

after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .
but before he can begin , the iranians must first finish clearing away the rubble . katrin matthaei -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rescue teams search for survivors at iran quake site international specialist rescue workers , among them germans , have reached the quake site in iran to search for survivors .

hundreds of cattle were slaughtered in germany in 2003 without undergoing bse testing , and now the european union is demanding answers .
meanwhile , the german government expects the number of untested cattle to rise . in germany , all cattle over 24 months in age are supposed to tested be for the deadly brain wasting disease bse , or bovine spongiform encephalopathy . but this week , officials in several german states admitted that authorities failed to conduct bse tests on over 600 cattle before they were slaughtered . now , the european commission wants answers . eu sources say that germany faces no immediate consequences for the breakdown in bse testing . " for now , we 're seeing this as an isolated incident , " an unnamed eu official told the german financial daily handelsblatt .
however , he said the eu is taking the matter seriously , as germany has breached eu regulations . concern about exports the commission has sent information about the lapse in testing to other eu states as part of the eu 's early warning system . eu officials have also asked berlin for information on the whereabouts of the untested beef to determine whether any of it was exported to other eu states .
the commission has n't set a deadline for the receipt of such information , saying the german authorities need time to complete their investigations . the state of bavaria is calling for tighter nationwide bse checks . bavaria 's minister for consumer affairs , werner schnappauf , said all the loopholes in the present system must be closed , and added that anyone found to have deliberately side-stepped the test procedure will face prosecution . " it should be clear to everyone that food safety is no laughing matter , " schnappauf said . numbers on the rise meanwhile , the government expects the number of untested cattle to rise .
deputy minister for consumer protection alexander müller said that in addition to the 611 cases already identified , there could be hundreds more , adding that the number could rise to 1,000 . each of the german states is responsible for ensuring that cattle over the age of 24 months are tested for bse before slaughter . the german regulations are more stringent than those of the eu , which stipulate that cattle over the age of 30 months be tested . germany imposed the regulations in the wake of a bse crisis in 2001 . scientists say the illness can cause a form of the brain-wasting creutzfeld jakob disease in humans who consume bse-infected beef products . at least 137 people , mostly in britain , are reported to have died from the disease . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany grapples with bse scare as the detection of mad cow creates havoc in the u.s. , alarm bells are ringing in germany after it emerged this week that hundreds of cattle in several states had been slaughtered without bse testing .

turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .
ankara has been struggling with a reform process meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership .
turkish membership has proved a divisive issue among european politicians , with some wary of admitting the predominantly muslim country into a largely christian eu .
chancellor schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations and made a strong endorsement last november , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security .
german conservatives up in arms however , just this week germany ’ s opposition conservatives reiterated opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid as part of their campaign for june ’ s european parliament election .

"
glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .
schröder insisted that the opposite would be true if turkey , a secular muslim democracy and nato ally , were to gain eu entry .

with its 126,000 turkish residents , berlin is home to the largest migrant group outside of turkey .
as the first turkish leader to visit the famed cultural melting pot , erdogan will also become the first turkish politician to officially call for the integration of turks in german society and urge them to fulfill their duties and responsibilities .
while touring the neighborhood , erdogan is scheduled to meet with turkish entrepreneurs and politicians as well as the berlin mayor .
mehpare bozyigit-kirchmann , director of tüsiad , the turkish industrialists ’ and businessmen ’ s association organizing erdogan ’ s berlin visit , said kreuzberg was selected because it didn ’ t just offer the dark side of immigration , but also its positive side visible in the lively coexistence of different cultures . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de istanbul blasts trigger debate about eu membership germany responded to the second set of bombings in istanbul with harsh words of condemnation .

"
glos has accused schröder ’ s social democratic party of supporting turkey ’ s bid merely as an attempt to win the 50,000-strong turkish vote in the country .
former christian democratic leader and head of foreign policy , wolfgang schäuble , suggested that the eu should offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of outright membership .
schröder has clashed with the conservatives on the issue in the past .
in november last year , he slammed a conservative politician , who had suggested that bomb attacks in istanbul the same month hurt turkey ’ s eu membership chances because the eu did not want to risk importing militant islam .
schröder insisted that the opposite would be true if turkey , a secular muslim democracy and nato ally , were to gain eu entry .

turkish premier erdogan is in berlin on friday to discuss ankara ’ s eu bid at a time when german conservatives are renewing their staunch opposition to it . for the first time since the collapse of eu constitution talks last month , top representatives from 29 european nations will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the future of europe .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , irish prime minister and current president of the rotating eu presidency , bertie ahern , and turkish prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan will attend the forum organized by german media giant bertelsmann .
other high-profile guests include the leaders of romania , croatia , slovenia , latvia as well as spanish and polish foreign ministers .
chancellor gerhard schröder originally planned to attend the event , but had to cancel due to the flue .
ankara ’ s eu bid a divisive issue while eu leaders thrash out the finer points of kickstarting the eu motor , observers will be closely watching a meeting scheduled on the fringes between fischer and erdogan .
the talks are expected to center on ankara ’ s attempt to enter the european union that will expand to 25 in may , when it takes in ten new mainly former communist east european countries .
ankara has been struggling with a reform process meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership .
turkish membership has proved a divisive issue among european politicians , with some wary of admitting the predominantly muslim country into a largely christian eu .
chancellor schröder and his government have remained some of the strongest backers of turkey ’ s eu aspirations and made a strong endorsement last november , arguing that it would provide a bridge to the islamic world and greatly improve european security .

drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .
but is this a giant leap or merely a baby step towards a greener future ? new european union guidelines that come into effect this year are aimed at having all fuels become a mixture of traditional non-renewable fuel sources and renewable , biological components by the end of 2005 .
previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .
but according to rainer winzenried of shell , consumers should n't set their hopes too high .
" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .
germany is the largest single biofuel producer , accounting for about 30 percent of all eu production . according to winzenried , german fuel sales reach about 53 million tons .
and while germany already produces large quantities of rapeseed oil for mixing into diesel fuel , some oil companies say there are n't sufficient quantities of ethanol , a grain product that could be added to benzine . the german automobile club adac is also warning that the biofuel label does n't mean that such fuels are totally environmentally-friendly .
" while biofuels certainly have advantages over conventional fuels in terms of the most common dangerous emissions , the emissions of the nitrogen oxides associated with biofuels are somewhat higher , " said adac spokesman peter hemschik . fuel of the future while problems remain , proponents of renewable energies say the eu directive is necessary to start the ball rolling towards a cleaner , emission-free future . " one of the hurdles is distribution - making the fuel or fuel blends as widely available as possible . another hurdle is producing sufficient quantities to support widespread distribution , " todd allmendinger , managing director of emerging energy research , told dw-world .
" the eu directive will help push both forward .
it also raises awareness , and provides incentives for the auto industry , so overall , it could make higher targets much easier to reach in a shorter time frame , " he said . europeans can expect to start pumping the new biofuel mixtures in the first half of this year . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iceland aims for oil-free energy hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .

drivers in the eu will soon be filling their tanks with a mixture of normal gasoline and more environmentally friendly biofuels .
but is this a giant leap or merely a baby step towards a greener future ? new european union guidelines that come into effect this year are aimed at having all fuels become a mixture of traditional non-renewable fuel sources and renewable , biological components by the end of 2005 .
previously , consumers who wanted to go green at the gas station only had the option of buying " bio-diesel , " a rapeseed oil-based fuel that ended up being a marginalized niche product . the guidelines are part of a package of measures to promote the use of renewable energies and reduce the eu 's dependence on oil imports . by 2005 , the minimum share of biofuels should be 2 percent , though this should rise to as much as 5.7 percent by the year 2010 . effect on gas prices many experts have said that germans can expect gas prices to fall , since germany has adopted a tax exemption policy for biofuel producers .
but according to rainer winzenried of shell , consumers should n't set their hopes too high .
" it 's not just the fuel itself that costs money , " he told german news weekly spiegel .
" at present , it 's not clear if extra costs might offset the tax break . " according to oil companies , the new blended biofuels have to be stored separately , and they have to have the proper facilities to mix the new fuel - both things they say can drive prices up . some experts are also skeptical about whether the eu has the production capacity to meet its goals .
when the eu 's biofuel directive was released in 2001 , it led to a large increase in the production of substances such as plant oils , cereals and other crops , and organic waste materials - all which can be used in the production of biofuels .

turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan lobbied for his country ’ s eu admission in berlin on friday .
he did so in the city ’ s turkish neighborhood , but his visit provoked a mixed reaction on the streets . turkish-german business leaders had invited erdogan for breakfast at a penthouse apartment overlooking berlin ’ s kreuzberg district , but the turkish leader didn ’ t get to eat much as the room was too packed with people to get food to him . instead , he listened to germans talking about the integration of turkish people as well as turkey ’ s plans to join the eu and awaited his turn to speak . “ turkey has already decided in favor of the eu , ” erdogan then said , adding that about 75 percent of his countrymen were supportive of the plan .
“ we hope that by december we can set a date to commence admission talks . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit , left , and erdogan talk during the breakfast meeting .
referring to a recent debate in germany about turkey ’ s cultural differences that would prevent eu membership , erdogan admitted the road to eu admission would not be a smooth one . “ of course there are problems sometimes , ” he said , adding that he saw the union as a compromise of cultures .
“ but they also exist among current eu members .
you can only solve them through negotiations and we are convinced that we can do this . ” ankara has been struggling with reforms meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . solving the cyprus issue erdogan added that turkey would work on the issue of a possible reunification of cyprus .
should this not happen before may 1 , only the greek part of the mediterranean island will become one of 10 new eu member states on that date . “ the turkish side will take the necessary steps and we will definitely show our good will , ” he said .
“ but this good will has to come from both sides . ” some of those present said they saw erdogan ’ s visit to kreuzberg as a positive sign .
no turkish premier had ever visited the neighborhood , also known as “ little istanbul ” because of its large turkish population . “ it ’ s an appreciation of the turkish minority in germany , ” said kenan kolat , the vice president of the turkish community in germany , an organization which has about 200,000 members . bahattin kaya , president of an association of turkish-german business people in berlin and brandenburg , agreed that erdogan ’ s visit showed that he took the turkish community in germany seriously . “ but the people of kreuzberg didn ’ t get to see much of him , ” kaya said .
“ he should walk around and visit a market . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers arrest a left-wing demonstrator , who protested against erdogan 's visit in kreuzberg .
erdogan did manage to cram a brief hand-shaking session on the street into his schedule , however , some left-wing turks protested against his visit -lrb- photo -rrb- . and at a nearby outdoor market , many didn ’ t even know that turkey ’ s head of government had been around . mixed feelings on the street “ i ’ ve been living in berlin for 30 years , this is my home , ” said tanis gülr , who sells fruit and vegetables .
she added that she didn ’ t care much for politics . a few stalls down , 25-year-old hakan ünsal expressed his disappointment that erdogan hadn ’ t stopped by .
“ we ’ re happy he ’ s here , ” he said , wearing a turkish flag baseball cap .
“ but we would have been even happier if he ’ d come here . ” mukadder lusin göktas , who was visiting her husband ’ s jewelry store , saw things differently .
“ i ’ m not happy with him because he does nothing for the turks in germany , ” the 45-year-old said , adding that she often has to wait in line at the turkish consulate for hours to take care of paperwork . göktas , who has lived in germany for 25 years and is now a german citizen , also didn ’ t think much of erdogan ’ s plans to bring turkey into the eu . “ it ’ s already bad enough here , ” she said , adding that she ’ s unemployed and that her husband ’ s store will have to close because of bad business .
“ there ’ s 70 million people -lrb- in turkey -rrb- and they all want to get away from there . ” that ’ s not a typical standpoint , however , according to andreas goldberg , the executive director of the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university .

“ we hope that by december we can set a date to commence admission talks . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit , left , and erdogan talk during the breakfast meeting .
referring to a recent debate in germany about turkey ’ s cultural differences that would prevent eu membership , erdogan admitted the road to eu admission would not be a smooth one . “ of course there are problems sometimes , ” he said , adding that he saw the union as a compromise of cultures .
“ but they also exist among current eu members .
you can only solve them through negotiations and we are convinced that we can do this . ” ankara has been struggling with reforms meant to fulfill eu criteria agreed upon in a summit in copenhagen in dec .
2002 .
brussels has now offered to grant an audience to turkey at the end of 2004 to decide whether the bloc should open negotiations for possible eu membership . solving the cyprus issue erdogan added that turkey would work on the issue of a possible reunification of cyprus .
should this not happen before may 1 , only the greek part of the mediterranean island will become one of 10 new eu member states on that date . “ the turkish side will take the necessary steps and we will definitely show our good will , ” he said .
“ but this good will has to come from both sides . ” some of those present said they saw erdogan ’ s visit to kreuzberg as a positive sign .
no turkish premier had ever visited the neighborhood , also known as “ little istanbul ” because of its large turkish population . “ it ’ s an appreciation of the turkish minority in germany , ” said kenan kolat , the vice president of the turkish community in germany , an organization which has about 200,000 members . bahattin kaya , president of an association of turkish-german business people in berlin and brandenburg , agreed that erdogan ’ s visit showed that he took the turkish community in germany seriously . “ but the people of kreuzberg didn ’ t get to see much of him , ” kaya said .
“ he should walk around and visit a market . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers arrest a left-wing demonstrator , who protested against erdogan 's visit in kreuzberg .

she added that she didn ’ t care much for politics . a few stalls down , 25-year-old hakan ünsal expressed his disappointment that erdogan hadn ’ t stopped by .
“ we ’ re happy he ’ s here , ” he said , wearing a turkish flag baseball cap .
“ but we would have been even happier if he ’ d come here . ” mukadder lusin göktas , who was visiting her husband ’ s jewelry store , saw things differently .
“ i ’ m not happy with him because he does nothing for the turks in germany , ” the 45-year-old said , adding that she often has to wait in line at the turkish consulate for hours to take care of paperwork . göktas , who has lived in germany for 25 years and is now a german citizen , also didn ’ t think much of erdogan ’ s plans to bring turkey into the eu . “ it ’ s already bad enough here , ” she said , adding that she ’ s unemployed and that her husband ’ s store will have to close because of bad business .

after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .

after the earthquake in iran , many experts blame the adobe structures , which crumbled like sand , for the devastation .
one german professor believes adobe can be made safe , and he wants to show the iranians how . two weeks after the devastating earthquake in the iranian city of bam claimed more than 35,000 lives , rescue workers are still pulling bodies from the rubble of the city 's adobe buildings .
many blame the adobe for the degree of devastation because though it may be cheaper , it is far less resistant to the violent shaking of a strong earthquake than concrete or brick structures .
but gernot minke , an architecture professor from the german city of kassel , says adobe construction can be made safe , and he wants to bring his innovative techniques to iran .
it 's not the adobe , but how you put it together in many earthquake prone areas of the world , adobe is a popular form of construction - it 's cheap and plentiful .
sadly , the adobe bricks , which are made of clay , mud and sand , and dried in the sun , are not as strong as regular bricks , which are baked in an oven .
that 's why adobe has been outlawed in some areas , including the andies nations of south america .
professor minke , however , thinks the adobe materials have been unfairly blamed for the catastrophe , and the construction methods , not the adobe itself , are the culprit .
he has spent 25 years developing a more resilient building program , which , he says , could be applied in iran .
" after the last big earthquake in salvador , " says professor minke , " research showed that the houses made of oven-baked bricks using the same construction methods were just as likely to collapse . "
the adobe bricks are traditionally piled one on top of the other , plastered over , and a roof smacked on top of the whole thing .
when subjected to the violent horizontal shaking of an earthquake , the roofs slips and caves in , while the walls collapse towards the outside .
buildings better buildings professor minke believes that the corners of the buildings should be made stronger , to reinforce the very heavy adobe building material .
but , most importantly , he feels all four walls should be bound together by a so-called " circular beam " to tie the four walls together and prevent them from caving in as a result of side-to-side movement .
what 's more , the ceilings should be made of a much more light-weight insulated material and there should be more space between the windows and door casings .
of course , these techniques will cost more money .
nonetheless , professor minke is hoping he can convince the iranian government to take his advice : he and three other professors – if their funding is approved - would like to go to iran and share their know-how with local construction workers .
" the next step is to go there and conduct workshops aimed at showing locals the mistakes they 've made and offering them solutions , " he says .
but before he can begin , the iranians must first finish clearing away the rubble . katrin matthaei -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rescue teams search for survivors at iran quake site international specialist rescue workers , among them germans , have reached the quake site in iran to search for survivors .

watch breakfast 's interview feargal sharkey 's career has seen him start out as a punk and finish up on a government task force whose aim is to promote live music .
he 's best remembered for his time as lead singer of the punk-pop band the undertones which peaked in the late 1970s .
the band 's first single teenage kicks was released towards the end of 1978 , and for more than a decade after , the band had a clutch of hit singles and albums .
feargal sharkey was live on friday 's breakfast click here to see that interview his latest project will see him working alongside the arts minster estelle morris , as chairman of the live music forum .
its brief is to promote live music and monitor the introduction of the new licensing act which threatens to prevent small venues from putting on live music because of bureaucracy .
in a recent interview with the guardian newspaper he said the new forum would be to find out more about live music venues , how many people go and the total number of other resources like rehearsal rooms .
critics say they find it somewhat incongruous that that a government funded body is being led by a former punk - and that much of the underlying basis of the punk scene was founded on anti capitalism .
sharkey is known to have a sharp brain when it comes to business - he arranged the undertones ' five year record deal .
he went on to have some success as a solo act with top 10 hit never never and his 1985 number one a good heart but this phase of his career was to prove short lived .
a spell as an a & r man for a record company and a stint as a label boss followed but sharkey had always wondered what life in his 40s would hold .
five years of experience dealing with the government followed when he took a job at the radio authority and the contract ran out but overlapped with his new position .

the government says it has made a conditional offer to provide £ 200m in private finance initiative credits .
the bridge is part of mayor ken livingstone 's plans to redevelop the thames gateway , a 40-mile-wide area from east and south-east london to kent and essex .
the bridge would be 650-metres long and have two lanes each way for cars and commercial vehicles , a cycle lane , a footpath and a lane for public transport .
the crossing would be built and operated by a private company , working with tfl in a private finance initiative -lrb- pfi -rrb- deal .
it has been criticised by some environmentalists and friends of the earth say it will be used by businesses to transport more road freight .
but tfl says it could cut up to 30 minutes off local journey times and the mayor believes it to be a " vital " link to an area which needs better housing and jobs .
he said he was delighted to hear the government was backing the project , adding : " east londoners have consistently given overwhelming support for the bridge . "
the bridge has to be between 50m and 70m high , so it does not get in the way of planes flying in to london city airport , or ships passing beneath .
it could be built by 2014 .

the bridge would be 650-metres long and have two lanes each way for cars and commercial vehicles , a cycle lane , a footpath and a lane for public transport .
the bridge will link beckton and thamesmead the crossing would be built and operated by a private company , working with tfl in a private finance initiative -lrb- pfi -rrb- deal .
it has been criticised by some environmentalists and friends of the earth say it will be used by businesses to transport more road freight .
but tfl says it could cut up to 30 minutes off local journey times and the mayor believes it to be a " vital " link to an area which needs better housing and jobs .
he said he was delighted to hear the government was backing the project , adding : " east londoners have consistently given overwhelming support for the bridge . "
the bridge has to be between 50m and 70m high , so it does not get in the way of planes flying in to london city airport , or ships passing beneath .
it could be built by 2014 .

figures revealed exclusively to bbc wales show that social services have overspent by £ 13m already this financial year .
it comes in the same week the welsh assembly government ordered welsh councils to spend £ 19.5m originally earmarked to help limit council tax increases on social care .
the assembly said the money was to go to ease bed-blocking and help get more elderly or infirm people who would otherwise be kept in hospital back out into the community and into their own homes .
nearly £ 1bn is spent each year by the 22 local authorities in wales on social services - caring for the country 's young , old and disabled people .
this time last year , social services departments were £ 4m over budget , but now the survey by the association of directors of social services has found the joint deficit is three times that .
councils are being forced to raid other departments for their balances , or alternatively carry forward debt to next year to make the books balance .
in some areas , children 's services make more demands of the 20 local authorities which responded to the questionnaire , 14 said they were overspent .
bridgend 's director of social services tony garthwaite said the figures prove the sector was inadequately funded .
" social care is expensive to provide , " he explained .
" people are living longer , and so they need to make more demands on social care .
" equally , on the children 's side of things , there are something like 1,000 more children being looked after by local authorities now than there were in 1999 .
the survey found that the lion 's share - nearly £ 12m - of the overspend had gone on children 's services .
caring for the growing elderly population in wales had led to the remainder of the budget deficit .
a statement from the welsh assembly government said it could not comment in detail until the report had been seen .
but it did recognise the pressures that local authorities social services departments faced , it said - which was why £ 19.5m extra money was announced earlier this week for social care .
" social services is a vital frontline service which can lead to significant pressures on budgets . , " the statement said .
" we are aware of this and have taken action by making a significant investment in this area , " the statement said .

the uk company said like-for-like sales , including petrol , jumped 10.2 % in the six weeks to january 4 .
analysts believe family-run morrisons ' strong performance over the period could outpace rival supermarket groups .

the welsh force - which has come under considerable criticism for its hard-line stance against speeding drivers - is the first in the uk to take the step .
a motorist can expect a £ 60 fine and three penalty points on the licence if caught doing 38mph or more in a 30mph zone in the force area .
but , until recently , if a motorist was clocked at 37mph in the same zone , nothing would be done .
now , however , drivers who are caught doing 37mph are being sent stern letters warning them that they , too , are breaking the law .
last month alone , as many as 500 warning letters were sent out .
the organisation which operates the cameras - arrive alive - has explained that the letters are aimed at getting people to slow down , and teaching road-users the dangers of speeding .
mr shaw believes his punishment was ' draconian ' but the chief constable of north wales , richard brunstrom , has already admitted that the thresholds at which drivers get fined are under review and he would like to see them reduced .
mr brunstrom 's tough line on law-breaking motorists has put his force under the spotlight several times in recent months .
in december a retired bank manager who became embroiled in a speeding row with him called for his resignation .
william shaw , 71 , was angered when chief constable richard brunstrom called a news conference to attack him after he complained about a speeding conviction in july .
the pensioner has written a detailed complaint against mr brunstrom to the north wales police authority 's professional standards committee which will consider the matter next month .
mr shaw lost a 50-year clean driving record when a speed camera in flintshire caught driving at 39mph in a 30mph zone earlier this year .
he claimed in court his prosecution was unfair and said north wales police had misused their power .
mr shaw , from llangollen , said he was pleading guilty in the hope magistrates would reject the case .
he is now calling for a public apology from the chief constable and his resignation .
in court he claimed he had completed a safe driving manoeuvre and police were hitting " soft targets " like him .
magistrates fined mr shaw £ 60 , with £ 30 costs and three penalty points , and said they had " every sympathy " with him .
speaking at the time mr brunstrom said the pensioner had been " irresponsible " and was " misleading the public . "
mr shaw 's complaint against mr brunstrom will be discussed when the committee meet in january .
members will meet in private with neither the chief constable nor mr shaw present .
a spokesman for the police authority said members will decide " if the complaint can be dealt with or if it has to be dealt with by an outside investigator . "
mr brunstrom has been heavily criticised for his zero-tolerance policy against speeding motorists who he has described as " anti-social " and " criminals " .

toshiba has developed a tiny hard drive which measures less than an inch across but can hold between two and four gigabytes of data .
the drive , about the size of a £ 1 coin , was announced at the consumer electronics show in las vegas .
the hard drive has emerged as one of the key components in the push to bring computing technologies to the home .
some video cameras and music players such as apple 's ipod have taken advantage of the shrinking size of hard drives .
' significant breakthrough ' toshiba was the first major manufacturer to come out with a 1.8-inch drive holding up to 40gb , which is used in the ipod and other mp3 players .
since then , others have raced to catch up .
hitachi and others now sell one inch hard drives that can hold 1gb to 4gb of data .
but toshiba says it is the first company to break the one inch barrier with its new drive .
" our new miniature drive is a significant technological breakthrough , " said nick spittle of toshiba storage device division europe .
" it is set to bring explosive growth in smaller and more mobile digital devices , with a host of hot new portable gadgets for the consumer . "
toshiba said it expects the new drive to inspire others to think about incorporating hard drives into their products , such as mobile phones and digital camcorders .
" our small yet powerful , highly functional drives are an enabling tool for other companies ' imagination and creativity , accelerating the fusion of computing tools and consumer electronics products , " said mr spittle .
tvs and mobiles increasing capacity , shrinking sizes and falling prices have led to the use of hard drives in consumer electronics goods , such as digital video recorders .
samsung has already put a hard drive into a digital camcorder that is slightly bigger than a computer mouse .
in the future , the miniature drives could be built into television sets and mobile phones .
toshiba expects to start mass producing the drives in the autumn , with its factories churning out 200,000 to 300,000 units a month .

toshiba has developed a tiny hard drive which measures less than an inch across but can hold between two and four gigabytes of data .
the drive , about the size of a £ 1 coin , was announced at the consumer electronics show in las vegas .
the hard drive has emerged as one of the key components in the push to bring computing technologies to the home .
some video cameras and music players such as apple 's ipod have taken advantage of the shrinking size of hard drives .
' significant breakthrough ' toshiba was the first major manufacturer to come out with a 1.8-inch drive holding up to 40gb , which is used in the ipod and other mp3 players .
since then , others have raced to catch up .
hitachi and others now sell one inch hard drives that can hold 1gb to 4gb of data .
but toshiba says it is the first company to break the one inch barrier with its new drive .
" our new miniature drive is a significant technological breakthrough , " said nick spittle of toshiba storage device division europe .
" it is set to bring explosive growth in smaller and more mobile digital devices , with a host of hot new portable gadgets for the consumer . "
toshiba said it expects the new drive to inspire others to think about incorporating hard drives into their products , such as mobile phones and digital camcorders .
" our small yet powerful , highly functional drives are an enabling tool for other companies ' imagination and creativity , accelerating the fusion of computing tools and consumer electronics products , " said mr spittle .
tvs and mobiles increasing capacity , shrinking sizes and falling prices have led to the use of hard drives in consumer electronics goods , such as digital video recorders .
samsung has already put a hard drive into a digital camcorder that is slightly bigger than a computer mouse .
in the future , the miniature drives could be built into television sets and mobile phones .
toshiba expects to start mass producing the drives in the autumn , with its factories churning out 200,000 to 300,000 units a month .

the novel , ostensibly for children but admired by many critics , has been making waves in the past year .
it made the man booker prize longlist in 2003 but , to the surprise of many , failed to make the shortlist .
booker chairman john carey protested in exasperation when his fellow judges refused to let him shortlist haddon 's work .
click here to send in your review of the book " i found it breathtaking , " he said .
" it is an extraordinary thing that these educated people do n't agree . "
but the novel picked up several other awards , including the guardian children 's fiction prize and the booktrust teenage prize .
' for adults ' writer ian mcewan said the book was a " superb achievement " while the times newspaper said it was one of the most original novels in years .
and writers who named it among their favourite books of the year were joanne harris , peter carey , ian hislop and nigel williams .
haddon , who is best known as a children 's author , has said he did not write the curious incident of the dog in the night-time for children , and saw it as more of a book for adults .
but publishers took the book and released two versions , with one cover aimed at adults and one for teenage readers .
the central character , christopher boone , is a 15-year-old with a form of autism , a maths genius who can not understand the complexities of human behaviour .
the curious incident of the dog in the night-time is written in his voice as he sets out on a journey to discover who killed his neighbour 's dog .
thought-provoking despite being warned to keep out of other people 's business by his long-suffering father , christopher will not be distracted from his mission , but by carrying on he opens up dark secrets about his life .
author mark haddon is best known for his children 's books .
but this is a brilliantly written novel disguised as a murder-mystery which , through the eyes of christopher , gives a different view of the world .
christopher often sees his own at times bizarre behaviour , such as hating anything yellow or brown and not talking for days , as completely logical , and he rarely focuses on his disability .
it also reveals the difficulties suffered by those around him , who try to remain patient but understandably find the pressure of caring for a special needs child hard to handle .
the book is both painfully funny and moving , as well as convincing and thought-provoking - christopher 's struggles with everyday life are something to be admired .
it is only a short novel , interspersed with illustrations and maths equations , but the reader is able to completely immerse themselves in the eccentric world of christopher boone .
mark haddon 's the curious incident of the dog in the night-time is published by jonathan cape .
have you read the novel ?
do you think it is a worthy winner ?
back to the top send us your views on the form below .
a truly groundbreaking and transgressive book .
it takes the reader into the obsessive other world of autism with understanding and empathy .
debra , uk it 's an incredible book , and an incredible story .
having worked with kids with varying degrees of autism i found the realism of christopher 's situation at the same time moving , funny and life-affirming .
i thought the book waned slightly towards the end , with the family backstory taking precedence over christopher 's quest , which was more interesting , but it was n't enough to spoil what was possibly the best book i 've read in years .
i 'm currently reading vernon god little , which won the man booker prize , and i can not for the life of me figure out how it even made the shortlist when curious incident did not .
john sinclair , scotland i am 15 and i read this book and was taken aback with how well written it was .
i am an avid reader and there is nothing better than sitting in front of the fire reading a good book .
and this book is truly excellent .
i found it compelling and sad , informative yet fun .
this book is a must read and i think it is brilliant .
jake rebuck , england i had to read this novel for my book group and would n't have chosen it myself but i loved it to bits .
however disapproving john carey 's pompous viewpoint , a few educated people in the group did n't !
it 's brilliant , i think , but if you do n't like it , you do n't .
who 's to say what is or is n't a good book - a book you like is a great book , if it does n't grab you , it 's not .
emma , uk i read this book with particular interest as i have a son with asperger 's .
it really was both funny and moving and has caused much controversy in the family -lrb- we 've all read it , with the notable exception of my son with asperger 's , who " wo n't read fiction " ! - we argued about the behaviour of christopher 's father and whether he was an adequate parent -rrb- .
i was delighted to hear this morning that mark haddon is getting the acclaim he deserves .
jane napier , england mark haddon 's book is one of the most enjoyable novels that i have read in some time .
ostensibly about christopher solving the mystery of who killed his neighbours dog -lrb- the title is taken from sherlock homes -rrb- this book is really about so much more : life , love , coping with disability and above all parental responsibility -lrb- and irresponsibility -rrb- .
i urge anyone to read it .
john carey was right , the other booker judges made a serious mistake for not putting this wonderful book on the booker shortlist .
thank heavens the whitbread judges were not as short sighted .
mark nelson , uk my young nephew has asperger 's syndrome -lrb- as -rrb- , like the hero of this story .
whilst remaining funny , heartwarming and highly entertaining , haddon 's book provided me with more insight into as than any number of ' academic ' articles had managed .
i re-read aloud practically every chapter to my family as a means of illustrating and explaining the sometimes bewildering though always charming behaviour of our lovely d. deserved winner ; buy the book .
jamie frankis , uk a worthy winner ?
what , a book that is relentlessly inventive from page one , that offers a rollercoaster of emotions for the reader , and creates a very complete and different world ?
a book that might coax a very wide range of people to pick it up , -lrb- even teenagers -rrb- enjoy it and maybe even discuss it ?
not the sort of thing awards are usually handed out for , surely !
of course it 's a worthy winner .
it 's just one of those very rare books that appeals beyond the margins of the few , without a hint of compromise .
mike shuttleworth , australia this is simply the best book i 've read in years , forget the childrens ' / adult version description , they are the same book and it is a distraction .
it is one book which should be read by everyone .
it makes you begin to understand autism without being condescending and is very funny and very moving , making me cry in places .
i 've even bought it for others to read , including two friends with autistic children .
cheesy though it may sound , if you read one book this year , the curious incident should be the one you choose .
hilary , uk i discovered the book by chance and then read it all in one day in two sittings as i could not put it down .
i teach a boy with aspergers syndrome and i feel like i 've never understood him better than now .
it is so remarkably accurate in describing the features and i was incredibly moved at times .

the curious incident of the dog in the night-time is written in his voice as he sets out on a journey to discover who killed his neighbour 's dog .
thought-provoking despite being warned to keep out of other people 's business by his long-suffering father , christopher will not be distracted from his mission , but by carrying on he opens up dark secrets about his life .
author mark haddon is best known for his children 's books .
but this is a brilliantly written novel disguised as a murder-mystery which , through the eyes of christopher , gives a different view of the world .
christopher often sees his own at times bizarre behaviour , such as hating anything yellow or brown and not talking for days , as completely logical , and he rarely focuses on his disability .
it also reveals the difficulties suffered by those around him , who try to remain patient but understandably find the pressure of caring for a special needs child hard to handle .
the book is both painfully funny and moving , as well as convincing and thought-provoking - christopher 's struggles with everyday life are something to be admired .
it is only a short novel , interspersed with illustrations and maths equations , but the reader is able to completely immerse themselves in the eccentric world of christopher boone .
mark haddon 's the curious incident of the dog in the night-time is published by jonathan cape .

the novel , ostensibly for children but admired by many critics , has been making waves in the past year .
it made the man booker prize longlist in 2003 but , to the surprise of many , failed to make the shortlist .
booker chairman john carey protested in exasperation when his fellow judges refused to let him shortlist haddon 's work .
click here to send in your review of the book " i found it breathtaking , " he said .
" it is an extraordinary thing that these educated people do n't agree . "
but the novel picked up several other awards , including the guardian children 's fiction prize and the booktrust teenage prize .
' for adults ' writer ian mcewan said the book was a " superb achievement " while the times newspaper said it was one of the most original novels in years .
and writers who named it among their favourite books of the year were joanne harris , peter carey , ian hislop and nigel williams .
haddon , who is best known as a children 's author , has said he did not write the curious incident of the dog in the night-time for children , and saw it as more of a book for adults .
but publishers took the book and released two versions , with one cover aimed at adults and one for teenage readers .
the central character , christopher boone , is a 15-year-old with a form of autism , a maths genius who can not understand the complexities of human behaviour .
the curious incident of the dog in the night-time is written in his voice as he sets out on a journey to discover who killed his neighbour 's dog .
thought-provoking despite being warned to keep out of other people 's business by his long-suffering father , christopher will not be distracted from his mission , but by carrying on he opens up dark secrets about his life .
author mark haddon is best known for his children 's books .
but this is a brilliantly written novel disguised as a murder-mystery which , through the eyes of christopher , gives a different view of the world .
christopher often sees his own at times bizarre behaviour , such as hating anything yellow or brown and not talking for days , as completely logical , and he rarely focuses on his disability .
it also reveals the difficulties suffered by those around him , who try to remain patient but understandably find the pressure of caring for a special needs child hard to handle .
the book is both painfully funny and moving , as well as convincing and thought-provoking - christopher 's struggles with everyday life are something to be admired .
it is only a short novel , interspersed with illustrations and maths equations , but the reader is able to completely immerse themselves in the eccentric world of christopher boone .
mark haddon 's the curious incident of the dog in the night-time is published by jonathan cape .

i thought the book waned slightly towards the end , with the family backstory taking precedence over christopher 's quest , which was more interesting , but it was n't enough to spoil what was possibly the best book i 've read in years .

there 's been quite a lot of bad press coming out of the ivory coast during recent months .
abidjan has seen plenty of trouble in recent months in fact , ever since september 2002 , when there was an attempted coup and the country subsequently divided laterally , between north and south , life in the once stable and thriving west african country , has sounded pretty gloomy .
before i arrived , i was warned against being sucked into an apparent sense of normality here , which i suppose means , a false sense of security .
i also warned myself against comparing ivory coast with the last country i reported from : angola .
but i 'm afraid , so far , i admit to doing both .
airport the airport is a good place to start .
shiny walls , slippery clean floors , polished glass cubicles in which immigration officials sit in pressed uniforms .
but where are the guns ?
no guns .
i thought this place was at war - or at least , not in peace - so the airport would be well-armed .
but i was wrong .
in fact , two particularly large men , in army fatigues , sitting on a bench just in front of the exit gave me a friendly hand-shake , and neither of them were holding guns .
so far , so good and dare i say it , a long way from angola 's quatro de fevereiro airport .
the comparisons do n't stop there .
driving from the airport into town , you have to search for the potholes along the smooth and swift dual carriageways .
after four days in this country , i have counted just one pothole for each day .
i must be missing something .
surely .
driven batty i was equally impressed by all the pavements in the centre of town : pavements and trees line the streets that sit neatly under tower blocks , some of which are covered with reflective glass .
perhaps it 's inside those buildings that ivory coast 's ceos drink the champagne i am told is sold all over abidjan .
fruit bats make a racket outside the window the sounds and the smells of this city have also struck me .
sounds of fruit bats hanging upside down in their hundreds .
do they ever sleep ?
i thought they came alive at night , and yet they seem to spend all day chattering in the branches at just about the same level as the bbc office .
they 're known here as les chauve-souris , literally bald-mice .
why not flying mice or loud mice ?
i do n't know .
on monday , president laurent gbagbo drove past our office .
i watched from the eighth floor as he stopped to greet young men and women who were cheering and clapping by the side of the road .
suddenly , in the branches in front of me , the bald-mice seemed to find the excitement infectious .
they dropped headfirst from their branches , before flapping in large circles above the crowds below .
how did they know it was president gbagbo ?
i thought bats were blind .
perhaps they have the powers of a cameroonian woman i met on wednesday evening .
she was serving me some fish at one of the many small road-side cafes , serving fish , chicken , and other meats on superb grills .
well , at this particular maquis , this lady from yaounde told me that she could guess the name of one of the men i was with .

sinatra : the main event was billed as an unofficial biography of the singer .
but his family argued that it infringed the singer 's trademark and the word " unauthorised " was in such small print that the public would be confused .
family lawyers said a los angeles court awarded an injunction and " substantial " damages against producers main event .
the show featured an impersonator and played briefly in atlantic city in 2001 and in las vegas in 2002 . "
my father spent a lifetime concerned with the quality and integrity of his professional life " tina sinatra daughter sinatra : the main event had also been the title of an authorised television programme and audio and video recordings during his life .
sinatra 's daughter tina said the family brought the lawsuit to protect the legacy of her father , who died in aged 82 in may 1998 .
" my father spent a lifetime concerned with the quality and integrity of his professional life , " she said .
" it is unfortunate that we must resort to the judicial system to stop people who simply want to profit from the use of his name . "

their movements are severely restricted and local reporters are officially forbidden from contacting separatist rebels of the free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- .
they put a pistol on the table in front of me and said ' if you keep messing about like you have been , there 's a bullet in here for you ' maarif but one editor 's testimony has shed light on the unofficial pressures being used to influence and suppress news .
maarif , whose newspaper closed last month after intimidation from the authorities , said he was hit about the head and threatened with a pistol .
a young man with an intense expression , maarif has now fled the province and is in hiding .
but even after he left , he continued to receive threatening phone calls asking where he was , and when he was coming back to the province .
maarif , 25 , moved with his family from java to aceh in 1981 , as part of indonesia 's programme of transmigration .
he may not be ethnically acehnese , but home is where the heart is , and maarif 's heart is firmly rooted in acehnese soil .
after university , maarif and a group of his friends , most in their twenties , decided to start their own newspaper in aceh .
" beudoh " was launched in early 2003 , when a now collapsed peace process between the government and rebels was still in effect .
maarif described the paper as being concerned with issues like human rights , as they affected ordinary people .
he said the paper did not often tackle big political subjects .
" all the main papers at that time were supporting the government line so we wanted to present an alternative view , " he said .
over a period of six months , eight editions of the tabloid were published .
government line the military wanted us ... to support the government line , but not everyone agrees with martial law maarif but after martial law was declared in may 2003 , local journalists found themselves under enormous pressure , as maarif discovered first hand .
" there was a conflict between what we wrote and what the military wanted us to write .
they wanted us to support the government line , but not everyone agrees with martial law " , he said .
one article in particular - about indonesia 's forthcoming parliament elections - attracted the attention of the military authorities .
" we wrote a piece about the election in april .
we said that we did n't think it would be possible to have a truly democratic election under martial law , so it would be better not to stage the poll in aceh " .
maarif was called in for questioning .
" i was interrogated for eight hours .
the soldiers slapped me about the head and threw chairs across the room as a kind of shock therapy .
they accused me of betraying my country .
at one point they rolled up a copy of my paper and started hitting me with that " .
the interrogators did not tell maarif to close the paper .
in fact they made it clear that they wanted him to continue publishing , but all articles would have to support the official military line .
" they put a pistol on the table in front of me and said ' if you keep messing about like you have been , there 's a bullet in here for you ' " .
threats maarif said journalists can not cover the conflict properly maarif was eventually allowed to go .
after consulting his colleagues on the paper , a decision was taken to cease publication rather than compromise what they considered to be their editorial principles .
maarif 's interrogators had warned him not to tell the media what had happened .
but word had already got out .
" my friends already knew i had been called in for questioning . "
maarif said , " and in any case the public has a right to know , so i decided to tell my story . "
fearing for his safety , he also decided to leave aceh .
maarif 's experience has left him disillusioned .
he thinks it is impossible for journalists to cover the conflict in aceh properly .
" it 's hard to be balanced because it 's so difficult to go into the field and find out what 's really happening .
all the information is coming from the government or the military .
it 's impossible to carry out a proper investigation because all local ngo 's have been closed " .
despite the difficulties , maarif said he thought it was important for local journalists to try to tell the truth , so that their reports could be used as reference documents in the future .
but would he ever return to aceh himself ?
" i really want to , but i do n't think we can continue with our paper during this military emergency .
maybe when it 's all over " .

" i 'm not a bad person .
i 'm really not , " she said .
" everyone has a past . "
she said she had wanted to use the money to help her family and recently laid-off cleveland police officers .
when she was asked directly if she lied , ms battle 's lawyer , sheldon starke , refused to let her answer .
" i wanted to win , " she told reporters .
" the numbers were so overwhelming .
i did buy a ticket and i lost it . "
the ohio lottery said it had known the truth all along .
ms jemison provided a second ticket bought at the same time and place as the winning ticket , and had a ticket that showed she had played the same numbers in the prior drawing , the lottery said .

william hill said a close finish to the english football premiership title race in 2003 had fuelled punter interest .
the firm 's horse racing operations have also expanded with the introduction of computer-generated racing .

the company operates three divisions - betting shops , telephone gambling , and an interactive division that allows customers to place bets via the internet .
chief executive david harding said : " the group has had an excellent trading year and all three divisions have delivered good levels of growth in gross win and profitability . "
analysts expect william hill to double its pre-tax profits to £ 167.7m -lrb- $ 307m -rrb- for the year to 30 december .

the company 's shares have climbed steadily since early 2003 , pausing only last autumn while questions over the future of in-shop betting terminals were resolved .

us homeland security officials and technology specialists have been staging a mock terrorist exercise , snappily titled terrorex 04 .

it is part of the annual government convention on emerging technologies , which showcases hi-tech products developed for use in the fight against terror .

director anthony minghella 's take on love in the desert produced the award-winning film the english patient .
this time , the backdrop for his epic love story is the remote hills of north carolina .
but it is hard to imagine cinema-goers warming to cold mountain .
minghella is aiming for a modern gone with the wind , but only manages a forrest gump with better acting and prettier scenery .
the film stars law and kidman as lovers uprooted by a war that changed a nation .
zellweger gives kidman a helping hand based on charles frazier 's award-winning novel , law plays wp inman , a hero in the best tradition of strong , silent types .
kidman is ada monroe , the very picture of old southern manners .
ada arrives on the scene when her preacher father -lrb- donald sutherland -rrb- leaves charleston for the more pastoral pleasures of cold mountain .
she meets inman and two or three clunkily-scripted scenes later we have a backwoods version of scarlett o 'hara and ashley wilkes .
but all is not what it seems in the garden of eden .
war is around the corner and the rather useless ada is also being romantically pursued by ray winstone 's bearded beast , teague .
inman begins a ulysses-like trek home and the journey , like the film , is long and arduous .
law -lrb- pictured -rrb- and kidman spend little screen time together it is not without incident , however , with plenty of portentous sentiment and some very good acting .
inman encounters a who 's who of hollywood talent - philip seymour hoffman , giovanni ribisi and natalie portman - who all either help , hinder or tempt our hero from his righteous path back to the woman he loves .
meanwhile , an over-acting but green-fingered renee zellweger arrives to help ada out on the farm .
but as good as parts of this film are - the battle scenes , the law and portman vignette , seymour hoffman 's frisky clergyman - cold mountain can not overcome the problems of its central uninspiring romance .
minghella 's previous oscars triumph , the english patient may not have suited all tastes , but at least the passion between its stars ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas was believable .
cold mountain is out now in the uk - the views page is now closed but please see below for a selection of your comments .
a beautiful piece of film making , david lean is alive and well and trapped inside mingella 's head .
the scenery alone is worth the ticket price , but then you add in fine performances , a well written script , and some stunning camera work and effects .
this film is so refreshingly grown-up .
alice thomas , uk beautiful scenery , some excellent acting -lrb- although i felt zellwegger was irritatingly caricaturing her role -rrb- , and some great scenes that really had me hooked .
but , by the time the film ended , the whole context and backdrop of the film , i.e. the civil war , seemed to have disappeared into insignificance , and i was left wondering what point the film had made .
for me , it had failed to make one .
claire , london , uk it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold christina , canada cold mountain is one of those films where the whole is somehow less than the sum of the parts .
had this not been so then it would have been absolutely magnificent !
thus it does n't quite hit the peaks of minghella 's others -lrb- patient / ripley -rrb- but at the same time it 's a very decent cinematic experience and full marks to him and the miramax team for undertaking it .
the fact that i 'm still turning it over means that it has left a strong impression whatever its minor shortcomings .
john coope , uk about 20 minutes too long -lrb- could have shaved off the gratuitous sex-scene -rrb- , but good performances from all -lrb- although the decision to change zellweger 's ruby from a cherokee but not the dialogue expressed by , or to , her , was a strange one -rrb- .
even on the big screen not as visually captivating as it could have been ; it had no scale , to me , and seemed ' small ' .
enjoyable enough .
alex hornby , uk a bit long although i thought the acting was generally good .
the most jarring problems for me , being from the southern us , were the accents .
jude law 's was impeccable but nicole kidman , ray winstone and philip seymour hoffman had some serious slips with their accent work .
rachel , usa an exceptional piece of entertainment .
followed the book well and was more than a match for the normal run-of-the-mill hollywood blockbusters .
jeremy radcliffe , england it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold .
i think mainly because of kidman unfortunately - she was just too beautiful and clean to believable - perfect makeup at all times etc .
law was wonderful though .
christina , canada this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure rob , uk truly a sign of a good film when you do not realise how long you have been sitting in the cinema !
j , uk i saw it for the performance from jack white as georgia ... i did n't think much of the rest of it .
katey , uk i thought nicole kidman was great .
a stunning piece of work .
emily , uk a gripping epic ; difficult to watch at times due to gritty violent scenes .
the cinematography is very , very good .
renée zellweger is undoubtedly the star - she 's outstanding as ruby .
but what stops the film from being , in my opinion , a classic is the lack of a real romantic payoff for the central characters , ada and inman .
the penultimate scene was incredibly depressing and disappointing , leaving my overall impression of the film as - well , a downer .
wendy , uk this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure .
excellent performances all round , with nicole kidman 's unutterably expressive visage again proving that she 's one of the greatest actresses of her generation .
minghella has an amazing eye , coupling this with his skills as an " actors ' director " to create a wonderful piece of cinema .
rob , uk it is , quite frankly , one of the most astonishing examples of a time period being recreated on the screen .
i saw the film in the company of several friends who read the book -lrb- as i did -rrb- and share with me an abiding interest in the civil war era .
minghella did not strike a single false note .
truly magnificent .
robert del valle , usa superb central performances from law and kidman , beautifully photographed - an all round high quality production .
anthony minghella has served up another excellent and riveting film without resorting to lots of contrived dramatic action and explosions -lrb- well ok apart from the big mother at the start -rrb- .
a truly tender and moving yarn without a drop of the ususal hollywood sentimentality .
excellent antidote to love actually .
roberto , uk what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
richard sherlock , uk beautifully shot , and a very accessible film .
kudos to ray winstone and jude law for nailing their roles .
i thought nicole kidman 's accent slipped on occasion .
what was n't to enjoy ?
simon , uk / usa an average film .
the film would have benefited greatly from having the utterly pointless sex scenes remove - which would then have dropped it down a rating and opened it up to a wider audience .
the point of these scenes could have been put across just as powerfully if they were only drunk , but no films these days must have pointless sex and bare flesh on display regardless .
in addition , although most of the characterisation was well constructed , there was little chemistry between the law and kidman which only served to weaken the whole structure on which the story is based .
what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
unlike the book , there was no reference to the slaves working in cold mountain and the tension in the relationships .
it seems odd that this was completely dropped and yet the story kept within the civil war period .
finally , the ending was also very disappointing - should have kept the original .
if in doubt go with the author not a screenwriter who 's hacking a work about .
overall - not bad but could do a lot better .
rivchard sherlock , uk best film of 2003 .
wonderful cinematography , excellent performances and a beautifully paced film that enraptures from start to finish , greatly enjoyed by an audience that applauded loudly at the end .
that says it all .
congratulations to a wonderful cast and crew , especially anthony minghella and iain smith .
you guys deserve an oscar for this one .
joanna , long island , new york brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann bill cahuasa , uk a fine cast , some top class acting , but still a blatant oscar vehicle .
i hope -lrb- for the creditability of the oscars -rrb- that cold mountain does n't win best film .
chatts , uk a genuinely fantastic piece of film making .
the cinematography was phenomenal .
we need to get over this issue about some films being too long .
bottom line , you ca n't make a 300 page book into a 90 minute film without butchering it .
this story needed the time to draw us in and develop the charecters .
that is what gets mangella the casts that he does in all his films .
storytelling is not compromised .
brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann .
the central romance was brilliantly played out .
it is the fact that the two lovers are both going through their own individual hells and the hope of the other gives them the strength to continue and grow as people that gives the film its resonance .
bill cahusac , united kingdom i -lrb- mostly -rrb- disagree with the review .
yes , there was some judicious cutting , and renee zellweger 's accent took a little time to settle down , but i thought that the acting , especially by jude law and p s hoffman , was excellent .
the romance may have been a little uninspriring , with ada being not particularly lovable , but then i thought the romance in the english patient was too , with both main characters being thoroughly unpleasant .
it did n't mean the film itself was bad .
a good use of $ 9 and a couple of hours .
alice carter , usa two and a half hours of my life - wasted !
a poorly scripted and unbelievable waste of time - the only redeeming features being the photography and zellweger 's - deliberately ? - comic performance .
it sems to try to be both a romance and an action / adventure and fails at both - if the scripting had been moved more in one direction or the other then - with such a strong cast - it would have fared far better .
in trying to encapsulate both genres , i fear the director will turn off lovers of both .
roger stout , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical oscar material dan cross , uk i thought it was a beautiful well acted and shot film that moved me a few times to the point of tears and had me crossing my fingers at the end for jude law to survive .
i fantastic tribute to the book .
sarah nelson , england it was n't a happy film , but the production was very well done and the acting generally brilliant .
cold mountain reminded me of the english patient in some aspects .
lots of bad things happening to people in wars , nasty brutish local big man , sumptuous scenery and lots of oscar-worthy detail .
mike hawkes , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical " oscar material " .
for my part , i almost fell asleep twice trying to stay interested but the actor 's plight did n't come over and grab my attention at all .
dan cross , uk against the current crop of heavy action films cold mountain stands out as a wonderfully moving , beautifully filmed story of a tragic love story in it 's finest mould .
i loved it .
i did n't notice the time pass and while noticing the differences between novel and film i was still gripped and moved all the way through .
kate , uk it was a good moved ruined by nicole kidman , renee zellwegger was great in this movie but it was a bit long for me .
nicky , uk boy , was i disappointed in cold mountain .
the story line was too drawn out and non-believable .
the movie was drawn out .
the acting was all right .
actually , the one who stole the movie was renee zellwegger .
she was at least spunky .
hope the movie does not win any oscars .
rhonda , usa i was terribly disappointed with cold mountain .
i found myself wondering what else could possibly go wrong for these poor souls ... and found out in the end !
what a horrible movie !
only good things in it were renee zellweger and jude law .
brenda , canada jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable evelyn hong , england great film apart from poor nicole - pretty as she is i just do n't see how she gets cast in roles with deep passionate love at their centre .
where 's the chemistry ?
it looked like she filmed her bits separately from the rest of the cast -lrb- as is usual with her films -rrb- .
oh - and martin from the uk - the film was based on a book which was n't about the american civil war or slavery but about inman 's journey -lrb- undertones of homer 's odyssey -rrb- .
jane , london , england an overlong , worthy , competent , clearly miramax-funded film , with the obligatory ' character ' part for philip seymour hoffman .
a more cynically oscar-courting movie has not been seen for some time .
nicole is meant to be a destitute farmer , so why does it always look like mrs max factor has just slapped on some more powder ?
and in the closing scenes , i 'm sure she 's got tinted contacts in .
what utter contempt minghella must have for the audience .
rupert cousens , uk overblown , waffly , historically inaccurate , pretentious - so sugary i kept checking the state of my teeth .
fiona starkey-norman , uk the film was far too long .
stricter editing on the battle scenes would have made it much better .
there was too much violence and sex .
jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable .
overall it was a big disappointment for me seeing the film - i felt it was a waste of time .
evelyn hong , england inman 's journey home from the battlefield was slow , painful and seemed like it would never end : having watched cold mountain i know how he felt .
tedious and self indulgent .
andrew ferguson , scotland excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent dave golding , uk i found the film to be a very well put together story with an excellent story line .
all the actors were magnificent in their roles , ray winstone and donald sutherland were a treat to watch .
the length of the film only helped to show the tribulations faced by jude law on his mission homewards .
all things said and done , there is a place for films like this and we should be grateful that there are people who are still prepared to make them despite of the critics opinions .
john boyle , uk enjoyable in parts and a good story , but far too long and drawn out throughout .
martyn , uk i think the film works very well and rather than spoon feeding us the romance lets us take a leap of faith with the characters .
given that they have very little onscreen time together , i think both law and especially kidman quickly established their passion for each other which sustains them - and the film for its epic journey .
graham thomas , uk excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent .
dave golding , uk a great film with fine performances from jude law , nicole kidman and renee zellweger - and good work from donald sutherland , eileen atkins , philip seymour hoffman and charlie hunnam in their supporting roles .
the battle scene in the first 15 minutes makes grim but compelling viewing , and from there on , the film really takes hold of you .
andrew buckingham , london wonderful , aside from nicole kidman , who left me cold and thus ruined the main reason for the quest .
holly , uk the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery martin , uk i did n't enjoy the english patient and i thought cold mountain only a little better .
overlong , slow , it ai n't no gone with the wind .
i could n't care about the two leads and the outcome of their relationship .
the supporting cast were good though .
it is the sort of film that the academy awards loves , which is unfortunate for peter jackson as the return of the king was a masterpiece and should win best film and best director .
lynda burns , edinburgh , scotland on his return jude law did an excellent impression of clint eastwood , looking cool as can be in cowboy designer stubble in the comany of fine women and perfectly delivering one-liners .. have you been shot ?
" not lately " .
steve w , uk beautifully filmed and superbly cast .
an enjoyable story which is given the time to develop .
minghella won me over with this film , i found the english patient unbearably dull .
steve , england brilliant , gorgeous - what over-acting from zellweger ? ? ? ? ? ?
some reviewers over-analyse everything ! ! ! !
martin garvey , uk cold mountain is another example of meaningless film-making - the characters are not rooted in historical reality .
the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery .
martin , uk sort of deliverance with war but really worth the watching at a cinema as its a very ' big ' film .
i thought it was better than the english patient and the romance restrained which was nice for a change !
jude law is gorgeous too .
trina , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was absolutely wonderful .
i read the book over 4 years ago and it lived up to all my expectations .
i laughed and sobbed through most of the movie and thought about it for days afterwards .
the acting was first class although i did notice southern accents occasionally slipping -lrb- yes , you ray winstone ! -rrb- but i do n't think any of the actors were from the deep south so i forgive them .
all in all totally tops ! ! ! ! !
emma , usa -lrb- originally uk -rrb- phew ! !
a very hard slog up a treacherous mountain is what i would compare sitting through this film to .
somewhat entertaining in a " i 've done it ! " kind of way .
thank god for renee zellwegger 's arrival half way through to save us from the ever pouting , eternally well-dressed nicole kidman .
dan rawlings , australia cold mountain - an absorbing and enjoyable film beautifully shot .
on the downside jude law was miscast as inman and it was difficult to warm to either of the two central characters -lrb- kidman and law -rrb- .
a missed opportunity in some respects mr minghella !
dave , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing .
mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was exceptional piece of filmmaking .
true , it did require patience but i was blown away by the performances of all the main cast particularly jude law , it was beautifuly shot and acted and i found it genuinely moving .
richard , ireland an excellent adventure .
kim howe , uk renee zellweger gives a funny performance and steals every scene she is in - she deserves the oscar buzz for best supporting actress .
otherwise , i agree with the bbc reviewer , the movie is fairly uninspiring .
andrea , canada i believe someone should ask charles frazier what he thinks of the film of his novel .
i think he would be horrified .
it is amazing how long the film is when you consider how much has been cut from the book .
hardly any of the beauty and depth of the novel survives the transition to the screen .
the decision to grow the teague character to accommodate the slender talents of ray winstone is a mistake .
much of the script as a whole is indeed clunky , no mean feat when the language of the novel is light and precise .
it is as if anthony minghella was jealous of the creativity and richness of the novel and has deliberately set out to jettison them .
a huge disappointment .
alan brown , england just as boring as the english patient , but without the pay-off of a big lead dying .
caroline , uk as mentioned - it was english patient meets gone with the wind .
long , with an abundance of triteness but still containing some memorable scenes and acting performances .
what was interesting is how nicole kidman 's character could be starving and freezing and yet have such a perfect complexion , clean hands and manage to keep all but four strands of hair in place .
what an amazing woman .
fred roboz , usa it takes a while to get over jude law and ray winstone putting on american accents , but once you do it 's well worth it .
some very moving moments .
george cockerill , uk utterly terrible .
one of the worst films i 've seen in a long while .
utterly pointless , lacking inspiration , hammy acting , it had nothing save for a few excellent scenes from law and some smouldering from portman .
kidman wasted , zellweger irritating .
philip seymour hoffman was excellent but his character was completely pointless and should have been left out to get the misery down to under 2 hours .
dire .
and 2 1/2 hours long .
graham , uk in the civil war movie cold mountain nicole kidman has the looks , temperament and acting ability of the queen 's corgis dog .
she is now going to star in a movie remake of the television series bewitched as samantha .
samantha at times would chnage into a corgis dog so this is a fitting role for nicole kidman .
clory jane mostek , united states of america a really good film with beautiful snowy scenes and thought provoking civil war scenes .
renee provided the light relief with great witty lines and was my particular favourite .
jude law and all the supporting cast did a brilliant job , but sadly nicole was a bit flat .
even so , i recommend people go and see cold mountain .
janet bangs , uk why was n't this film shot in north carolina ?
duh !
we are the third largest film center in the u.s. , with all the technical support and amenities needed for film professionals , yet it was filmed , for the most part , in europe .
would 've been a real winner had it been filmed on native soil .
joan , raleigh , nc usa while good in parts the film can not get past a central problem - the romantic leads are so rarely seen together that the underlying romance is unbelievable .
add in zellwegger 's ham acting and kidman 's immaculate presentation -lrb- farm girl with perfect make-up ? -rrb- and this one fails to involve .
richard moore , uk i enjoyed the film very much .
the leads are captivating .
i was especially impressed by the production design , the rural mountain community and scenery which looks truly authentic to western north carolina , where i live .
frazier 's novel is a masterpiece in its own right and likewise minghella 's film , a real treat for us to see a story so close to home up there on the screen .
i wish much success for cold mountain come awards time .
lara , usa one of the most beautiful stories you will ever see on film .
the acting was superb , especially rene zellweiger .
despair , tragedy , beauty , love , and hope .
michael fox , usa bored , bored , bored - finally gave in and walked out before the end , painfully bored .
michael edney , uk a finely crafted film with many excellent cast choices and performances , especially in the minor roles .
the attraction between ada and inman is very powerful , a subtle subtext in the book and the film does not fully capture that .
mike , uk i dont know what it is about minghella , but he seems to make otherwise good and sensual actors into wooden tops .
the english patient was cold and pretentious , but cold mountain was simply appalling .
how can all these good people giving all these good reviews have been taken in by such a truly awful film - the only saving grace -lrb- like in the english patient -rrb- was the scenery but if i had wanted to go to watch a travel film , i would have chosen to go . -lrb- oh - and renee zellwegger - what a relief she was -rrb- .
does the director instruct the love scenes by numbers - they look like it .
sorry fellow filmgoers , this appalling , insincere and pretentious film should not be up for any awards - but i felt the same for the english patient , and will never bother to give minghella the benefit of the doubt again .
sue , england your cold mountain reviewer is a bit harsh .
granted , the accents of some of the characters are irritating or unintentionally amusing as they keep slipping from southern american drawl into english , or mangled cockney in ray winstone 's case , but it 's still a beautifully shot , moving love story with great performances from kidman , law , hoffman and portman .
zellweger is outclassed and hams it up as a result , but you need some light relief in what is otherwise a very tragic story .
i 'm glad minghella has stayed true to the novel and kept the ending .
i thought kidman just slightly too old and wise for the role of ada but she was convincing all the same .
tammy , uk did matthew slater see the same film ?
this film blew me away !
hopefully cold mountain will clean up at the oscars and we can finally get over the bored of the rings hype .

director anthony minghella 's take on love in the desert produced the award-winning film the english patient .
this time , the backdrop for his epic love story is the remote hills of north carolina .
but it is hard to imagine cinema-goers warming to cold mountain .
minghella is aiming for a modern gone with the wind , but only manages a forrest gump with better acting and prettier scenery .
the film stars law and kidman as lovers uprooted by a war that changed a nation .
zellweger gives kidman a helping hand based on charles frazier 's award-winning novel , law plays wp inman , a hero in the best tradition of strong , silent types .
kidman is ada monroe , the very picture of old southern manners .
ada arrives on the scene when her preacher father -lrb- donald sutherland -rrb- leaves charleston for the more pastoral pleasures of cold mountain .
she meets inman and two or three clunkily-scripted scenes later we have a backwoods version of scarlett o 'hara and ashley wilkes .
but all is not what it seems in the garden of eden .
war is around the corner and the rather useless ada is also being romantically pursued by ray winstone 's bearded beast , teague .
inman begins a ulysses-like trek home and the journey , like the film , is long and arduous .
law -lrb- pictured -rrb- and kidman spend little screen time together it is not without incident , however , with plenty of portentous sentiment and some very good acting .
inman encounters a who 's who of hollywood talent - philip seymour hoffman , giovanni ribisi and natalie portman - who all either help , hinder or tempt our hero from his righteous path back to the woman he loves .
meanwhile , an over-acting but green-fingered renee zellweger arrives to help ada out on the farm .
but as good as parts of this film are - the battle scenes , the law and portman vignette , seymour hoffman 's frisky clergyman - cold mountain can not overcome the problems of its central uninspiring romance .
minghella 's previous oscars triumph , the english patient may not have suited all tastes , but at least the passion between its stars ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas was believable .
cold mountain is out now in the uk - the views page is now closed but please see below for a selection of your comments .
a beautiful piece of film making , david lean is alive and well and trapped inside mingella 's head .
the scenery alone is worth the ticket price , but then you add in fine performances , a well written script , and some stunning camera work and effects .
this film is so refreshingly grown-up .
alice thomas , uk beautiful scenery , some excellent acting -lrb- although i felt zellwegger was irritatingly caricaturing her role -rrb- , and some great scenes that really had me hooked .
but , by the time the film ended , the whole context and backdrop of the film , i.e. the civil war , seemed to have disappeared into insignificance , and i was left wondering what point the film had made .
for me , it had failed to make one .
claire , london , uk it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold christina , canada cold mountain is one of those films where the whole is somehow less than the sum of the parts .
had this not been so then it would have been absolutely magnificent !
thus it does n't quite hit the peaks of minghella 's others -lrb- patient / ripley -rrb- but at the same time it 's a very decent cinematic experience and full marks to him and the miramax team for undertaking it .
the fact that i 'm still turning it over means that it has left a strong impression whatever its minor shortcomings .
john coope , uk about 20 minutes too long -lrb- could have shaved off the gratuitous sex-scene -rrb- , but good performances from all -lrb- although the decision to change zellweger 's ruby from a cherokee but not the dialogue expressed by , or to , her , was a strange one -rrb- .
even on the big screen not as visually captivating as it could have been ; it had no scale , to me , and seemed ' small ' .
enjoyable enough .
alex hornby , uk a bit long although i thought the acting was generally good .
the most jarring problems for me , being from the southern us , were the accents .
jude law 's was impeccable but nicole kidman , ray winstone and philip seymour hoffman had some serious slips with their accent work .
rachel , usa an exceptional piece of entertainment .
followed the book well and was more than a match for the normal run-of-the-mill hollywood blockbusters .
jeremy radcliffe , england it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold .
i think mainly because of kidman unfortunately - she was just too beautiful and clean to believable - perfect makeup at all times etc .
law was wonderful though .
christina , canada this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure rob , uk truly a sign of a good film when you do not realise how long you have been sitting in the cinema !
j , uk i saw it for the performance from jack white as georgia ... i did n't think much of the rest of it .
katey , uk i thought nicole kidman was great .
a stunning piece of work .
emily , uk a gripping epic ; difficult to watch at times due to gritty violent scenes .
the cinematography is very , very good .
renée zellweger is undoubtedly the star - she 's outstanding as ruby .
but what stops the film from being , in my opinion , a classic is the lack of a real romantic payoff for the central characters , ada and inman .
the penultimate scene was incredibly depressing and disappointing , leaving my overall impression of the film as - well , a downer .
wendy , uk this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure .
excellent performances all round , with nicole kidman 's unutterably expressive visage again proving that she 's one of the greatest actresses of her generation .
minghella has an amazing eye , coupling this with his skills as an " actors ' director " to create a wonderful piece of cinema .
rob , uk it is , quite frankly , one of the most astonishing examples of a time period being recreated on the screen .
i saw the film in the company of several friends who read the book -lrb- as i did -rrb- and share with me an abiding interest in the civil war era .
minghella did not strike a single false note .
truly magnificent .
robert del valle , usa superb central performances from law and kidman , beautifully photographed - an all round high quality production .
anthony minghella has served up another excellent and riveting film without resorting to lots of contrived dramatic action and explosions -lrb- well ok apart from the big mother at the start -rrb- .
a truly tender and moving yarn without a drop of the ususal hollywood sentimentality .
excellent antidote to love actually .
roberto , uk what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
richard sherlock , uk beautifully shot , and a very accessible film .
kudos to ray winstone and jude law for nailing their roles .
i thought nicole kidman 's accent slipped on occasion .
what was n't to enjoy ?
simon , uk / usa an average film .
the film would have benefited greatly from having the utterly pointless sex scenes remove - which would then have dropped it down a rating and opened it up to a wider audience .
the point of these scenes could have been put across just as powerfully if they were only drunk , but no films these days must have pointless sex and bare flesh on display regardless .
in addition , although most of the characterisation was well constructed , there was little chemistry between the law and kidman which only served to weaken the whole structure on which the story is based .
what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
unlike the book , there was no reference to the slaves working in cold mountain and the tension in the relationships .
it seems odd that this was completely dropped and yet the story kept within the civil war period .
finally , the ending was also very disappointing - should have kept the original .
if in doubt go with the author not a screenwriter who 's hacking a work about .
overall - not bad but could do a lot better .
rivchard sherlock , uk best film of 2003 .
wonderful cinematography , excellent performances and a beautifully paced film that enraptures from start to finish , greatly enjoyed by an audience that applauded loudly at the end .
that says it all .
congratulations to a wonderful cast and crew , especially anthony minghella and iain smith .
you guys deserve an oscar for this one .
joanna , long island , new york brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann bill cahuasa , uk a fine cast , some top class acting , but still a blatant oscar vehicle .
i hope -lrb- for the creditability of the oscars -rrb- that cold mountain does n't win best film .
chatts , uk a genuinely fantastic piece of film making .
the cinematography was phenomenal .
we need to get over this issue about some films being too long .
bottom line , you ca n't make a 300 page book into a 90 minute film without butchering it .
this story needed the time to draw us in and develop the charecters .
that is what gets mangella the casts that he does in all his films .
storytelling is not compromised .
brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann .
the central romance was brilliantly played out .
it is the fact that the two lovers are both going through their own individual hells and the hope of the other gives them the strength to continue and grow as people that gives the film its resonance .
bill cahusac , united kingdom i -lrb- mostly -rrb- disagree with the review .
yes , there was some judicious cutting , and renee zellweger 's accent took a little time to settle down , but i thought that the acting , especially by jude law and p s hoffman , was excellent .
the romance may have been a little uninspriring , with ada being not particularly lovable , but then i thought the romance in the english patient was too , with both main characters being thoroughly unpleasant .
it did n't mean the film itself was bad .
a good use of $ 9 and a couple of hours .
alice carter , usa two and a half hours of my life - wasted !
a poorly scripted and unbelievable waste of time - the only redeeming features being the photography and zellweger 's - deliberately ? - comic performance .
it sems to try to be both a romance and an action / adventure and fails at both - if the scripting had been moved more in one direction or the other then - with such a strong cast - it would have fared far better .
in trying to encapsulate both genres , i fear the director will turn off lovers of both .
roger stout , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical oscar material dan cross , uk i thought it was a beautiful well acted and shot film that moved me a few times to the point of tears and had me crossing my fingers at the end for jude law to survive .
i fantastic tribute to the book .
sarah nelson , england it was n't a happy film , but the production was very well done and the acting generally brilliant .
cold mountain reminded me of the english patient in some aspects .
lots of bad things happening to people in wars , nasty brutish local big man , sumptuous scenery and lots of oscar-worthy detail .
mike hawkes , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical " oscar material " .
for my part , i almost fell asleep twice trying to stay interested but the actor 's plight did n't come over and grab my attention at all .
dan cross , uk against the current crop of heavy action films cold mountain stands out as a wonderfully moving , beautifully filmed story of a tragic love story in it 's finest mould .
i loved it .
i did n't notice the time pass and while noticing the differences between novel and film i was still gripped and moved all the way through .
kate , uk it was a good moved ruined by nicole kidman , renee zellwegger was great in this movie but it was a bit long for me .
nicky , uk boy , was i disappointed in cold mountain .
the story line was too drawn out and non-believable .
the movie was drawn out .
the acting was all right .
actually , the one who stole the movie was renee zellwegger .
she was at least spunky .
hope the movie does not win any oscars .
rhonda , usa i was terribly disappointed with cold mountain .
i found myself wondering what else could possibly go wrong for these poor souls ... and found out in the end !
what a horrible movie !
only good things in it were renee zellweger and jude law .
brenda , canada jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable evelyn hong , england great film apart from poor nicole - pretty as she is i just do n't see how she gets cast in roles with deep passionate love at their centre .
where 's the chemistry ?
it looked like she filmed her bits separately from the rest of the cast -lrb- as is usual with her films -rrb- .
oh - and martin from the uk - the film was based on a book which was n't about the american civil war or slavery but about inman 's journey -lrb- undertones of homer 's odyssey -rrb- .
jane , london , england an overlong , worthy , competent , clearly miramax-funded film , with the obligatory ' character ' part for philip seymour hoffman .
a more cynically oscar-courting movie has not been seen for some time .
nicole is meant to be a destitute farmer , so why does it always look like mrs max factor has just slapped on some more powder ?
and in the closing scenes , i 'm sure she 's got tinted contacts in .
what utter contempt minghella must have for the audience .
rupert cousens , uk overblown , waffly , historically inaccurate , pretentious - so sugary i kept checking the state of my teeth .
fiona starkey-norman , uk the film was far too long .
stricter editing on the battle scenes would have made it much better .
there was too much violence and sex .
jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable .
overall it was a big disappointment for me seeing the film - i felt it was a waste of time .
evelyn hong , england inman 's journey home from the battlefield was slow , painful and seemed like it would never end : having watched cold mountain i know how he felt .
tedious and self indulgent .
andrew ferguson , scotland excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent dave golding , uk i found the film to be a very well put together story with an excellent story line .
all the actors were magnificent in their roles , ray winstone and donald sutherland were a treat to watch .
the length of the film only helped to show the tribulations faced by jude law on his mission homewards .
all things said and done , there is a place for films like this and we should be grateful that there are people who are still prepared to make them despite of the critics opinions .
john boyle , uk enjoyable in parts and a good story , but far too long and drawn out throughout .
martyn , uk i think the film works very well and rather than spoon feeding us the romance lets us take a leap of faith with the characters .
given that they have very little onscreen time together , i think both law and especially kidman quickly established their passion for each other which sustains them - and the film for its epic journey .
graham thomas , uk excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent .
dave golding , uk a great film with fine performances from jude law , nicole kidman and renee zellweger - and good work from donald sutherland , eileen atkins , philip seymour hoffman and charlie hunnam in their supporting roles .
the battle scene in the first 15 minutes makes grim but compelling viewing , and from there on , the film really takes hold of you .
andrew buckingham , london wonderful , aside from nicole kidman , who left me cold and thus ruined the main reason for the quest .
holly , uk the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery martin , uk i did n't enjoy the english patient and i thought cold mountain only a little better .
overlong , slow , it ai n't no gone with the wind .
i could n't care about the two leads and the outcome of their relationship .
the supporting cast were good though .
it is the sort of film that the academy awards loves , which is unfortunate for peter jackson as the return of the king was a masterpiece and should win best film and best director .
lynda burns , edinburgh , scotland on his return jude law did an excellent impression of clint eastwood , looking cool as can be in cowboy designer stubble in the comany of fine women and perfectly delivering one-liners .. have you been shot ?
" not lately " .
steve w , uk beautifully filmed and superbly cast .
an enjoyable story which is given the time to develop .
minghella won me over with this film , i found the english patient unbearably dull .
steve , england brilliant , gorgeous - what over-acting from zellweger ? ? ? ? ? ?
some reviewers over-analyse everything ! ! ! !
martin garvey , uk cold mountain is another example of meaningless film-making - the characters are not rooted in historical reality .
the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery .
martin , uk sort of deliverance with war but really worth the watching at a cinema as its a very ' big ' film .
i thought it was better than the english patient and the romance restrained which was nice for a change !
jude law is gorgeous too .
trina , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was absolutely wonderful .
i read the book over 4 years ago and it lived up to all my expectations .
i laughed and sobbed through most of the movie and thought about it for days afterwards .
the acting was first class although i did notice southern accents occasionally slipping -lrb- yes , you ray winstone ! -rrb- but i do n't think any of the actors were from the deep south so i forgive them .
all in all totally tops ! ! ! ! !
emma , usa -lrb- originally uk -rrb- phew ! !
a very hard slog up a treacherous mountain is what i would compare sitting through this film to .
somewhat entertaining in a " i 've done it ! " kind of way .
thank god for renee zellwegger 's arrival half way through to save us from the ever pouting , eternally well-dressed nicole kidman .
dan rawlings , australia cold mountain - an absorbing and enjoyable film beautifully shot .
on the downside jude law was miscast as inman and it was difficult to warm to either of the two central characters -lrb- kidman and law -rrb- .
a missed opportunity in some respects mr minghella !
dave , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing .
mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was exceptional piece of filmmaking .
true , it did require patience but i was blown away by the performances of all the main cast particularly jude law , it was beautifuly shot and acted and i found it genuinely moving .
richard , ireland an excellent adventure .
kim howe , uk renee zellweger gives a funny performance and steals every scene she is in - she deserves the oscar buzz for best supporting actress .
otherwise , i agree with the bbc reviewer , the movie is fairly uninspiring .
andrea , canada i believe someone should ask charles frazier what he thinks of the film of his novel .
i think he would be horrified .
it is amazing how long the film is when you consider how much has been cut from the book .
hardly any of the beauty and depth of the novel survives the transition to the screen .
the decision to grow the teague character to accommodate the slender talents of ray winstone is a mistake .
much of the script as a whole is indeed clunky , no mean feat when the language of the novel is light and precise .
it is as if anthony minghella was jealous of the creativity and richness of the novel and has deliberately set out to jettison them .
a huge disappointment .
alan brown , england just as boring as the english patient , but without the pay-off of a big lead dying .
caroline , uk as mentioned - it was english patient meets gone with the wind .
long , with an abundance of triteness but still containing some memorable scenes and acting performances .
what was interesting is how nicole kidman 's character could be starving and freezing and yet have such a perfect complexion , clean hands and manage to keep all but four strands of hair in place .
what an amazing woman .
fred roboz , usa it takes a while to get over jude law and ray winstone putting on american accents , but once you do it 's well worth it .
some very moving moments .
george cockerill , uk utterly terrible .
one of the worst films i 've seen in a long while .
utterly pointless , lacking inspiration , hammy acting , it had nothing save for a few excellent scenes from law and some smouldering from portman .
kidman wasted , zellweger irritating .
philip seymour hoffman was excellent but his character was completely pointless and should have been left out to get the misery down to under 2 hours .
dire .
and 2 1/2 hours long .
graham , uk in the civil war movie cold mountain nicole kidman has the looks , temperament and acting ability of the queen 's corgis dog .
she is now going to star in a movie remake of the television series bewitched as samantha .
samantha at times would chnage into a corgis dog so this is a fitting role for nicole kidman .
clory jane mostek , united states of america a really good film with beautiful snowy scenes and thought provoking civil war scenes .
renee provided the light relief with great witty lines and was my particular favourite .
jude law and all the supporting cast did a brilliant job , but sadly nicole was a bit flat .
even so , i recommend people go and see cold mountain .
janet bangs , uk why was n't this film shot in north carolina ?
duh !
we are the third largest film center in the u.s. , with all the technical support and amenities needed for film professionals , yet it was filmed , for the most part , in europe .
would 've been a real winner had it been filmed on native soil .
joan , raleigh , nc usa while good in parts the film can not get past a central problem - the romantic leads are so rarely seen together that the underlying romance is unbelievable .
add in zellwegger 's ham acting and kidman 's immaculate presentation -lrb- farm girl with perfect make-up ? -rrb- and this one fails to involve .
richard moore , uk i enjoyed the film very much .
the leads are captivating .
i was especially impressed by the production design , the rural mountain community and scenery which looks truly authentic to western north carolina , where i live .
frazier 's novel is a masterpiece in its own right and likewise minghella 's film , a real treat for us to see a story so close to home up there on the screen .
i wish much success for cold mountain come awards time .
lara , usa one of the most beautiful stories you will ever see on film .
the acting was superb , especially rene zellweiger .
despair , tragedy , beauty , love , and hope .
michael fox , usa bored , bored , bored - finally gave in and walked out before the end , painfully bored .
michael edney , uk a finely crafted film with many excellent cast choices and performances , especially in the minor roles .
the attraction between ada and inman is very powerful , a subtle subtext in the book and the film does not fully capture that .
mike , uk i dont know what it is about minghella , but he seems to make otherwise good and sensual actors into wooden tops .
the english patient was cold and pretentious , but cold mountain was simply appalling .
how can all these good people giving all these good reviews have been taken in by such a truly awful film - the only saving grace -lrb- like in the english patient -rrb- was the scenery but if i had wanted to go to watch a travel film , i would have chosen to go . -lrb- oh - and renee zellwegger - what a relief she was -rrb- .
does the director instruct the love scenes by numbers - they look like it .
sorry fellow filmgoers , this appalling , insincere and pretentious film should not be up for any awards - but i felt the same for the english patient , and will never bother to give minghella the benefit of the doubt again .
sue , england your cold mountain reviewer is a bit harsh .
granted , the accents of some of the characters are irritating or unintentionally amusing as they keep slipping from southern american drawl into english , or mangled cockney in ray winstone 's case , but it 's still a beautifully shot , moving love story with great performances from kidman , law , hoffman and portman .
zellweger is outclassed and hams it up as a result , but you need some light relief in what is otherwise a very tragic story .
i 'm glad minghella has stayed true to the novel and kept the ending .
i thought kidman just slightly too old and wise for the role of ada but she was convincing all the same .
tammy , uk did matthew slater see the same film ?
this film blew me away !
hopefully cold mountain will clean up at the oscars and we can finally get over the bored of the rings hype .

law -lrb- pictured -rrb- and kidman spend little screen time together it is not without incident , however , with plenty of portentous sentiment and some very good acting .
inman encounters a who 's who of hollywood talent - philip seymour hoffman , giovanni ribisi and natalie portman - who all either help , hinder or tempt our hero from his righteous path back to the woman he loves .
meanwhile , an over-acting but green-fingered renee zellweger arrives to help ada out on the farm .
but as good as parts of this film are - the battle scenes , the law and portman vignette , seymour hoffman 's frisky clergyman - cold mountain can not overcome the problems of its central uninspiring romance .
minghella 's previous oscars triumph , the english patient may not have suited all tastes , but at least the passion between its stars ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas was believable .
cold mountain is out now in the uk - the views page is now closed but please see below for a selection of your comments .
a beautiful piece of film making , david lean is alive and well and trapped inside mingella 's head .
the scenery alone is worth the ticket price , but then you add in fine performances , a well written script , and some stunning camera work and effects .
this film is so refreshingly grown-up .
alice thomas , uk beautiful scenery , some excellent acting -lrb- although i felt zellwegger was irritatingly caricaturing her role -rrb- , and some great scenes that really had me hooked .
but , by the time the film ended , the whole context and backdrop of the film , i.e. the civil war , seemed to have disappeared into insignificance , and i was left wondering what point the film had made .
for me , it had failed to make one .
claire , london , uk it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold christina , canada cold mountain is one of those films where the whole is somehow less than the sum of the parts .
had this not been so then it would have been absolutely magnificent !
thus it does n't quite hit the peaks of minghella 's others -lrb- patient / ripley -rrb- but at the same time it 's a very decent cinematic experience and full marks to him and the miramax team for undertaking it .
the fact that i 'm still turning it over means that it has left a strong impression whatever its minor shortcomings .
john coope , uk about 20 minutes too long -lrb- could have shaved off the gratuitous sex-scene -rrb- , but good performances from all -lrb- although the decision to change zellweger 's ruby from a cherokee but not the dialogue expressed by , or to , her , was a strange one -rrb- .
even on the big screen not as visually captivating as it could have been ; it had no scale , to me , and seemed ' small ' .
enjoyable enough .
alex hornby , uk a bit long although i thought the acting was generally good .
the most jarring problems for me , being from the southern us , were the accents .
jude law 's was impeccable but nicole kidman , ray winstone and philip seymour hoffman had some serious slips with their accent work .
rachel , usa an exceptional piece of entertainment .
followed the book well and was more than a match for the normal run-of-the-mill hollywood blockbusters .
jeremy radcliffe , england it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold .
i think mainly because of kidman unfortunately - she was just too beautiful and clean to believable - perfect makeup at all times etc .
law was wonderful though .
christina , canada this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure rob , uk truly a sign of a good film when you do not realise how long you have been sitting in the cinema !
j , uk i saw it for the performance from jack white as georgia ... i did n't think much of the rest of it .
katey , uk i thought nicole kidman was great .
a stunning piece of work .
emily , uk a gripping epic ; difficult to watch at times due to gritty violent scenes .
the cinematography is very , very good .
renée zellweger is undoubtedly the star - she 's outstanding as ruby .
but what stops the film from being , in my opinion , a classic is the lack of a real romantic payoff for the central characters , ada and inman .
the penultimate scene was incredibly depressing and disappointing , leaving my overall impression of the film as - well , a downer .
wendy , uk this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure .
excellent performances all round , with nicole kidman 's unutterably expressive visage again proving that she 's one of the greatest actresses of her generation .
minghella has an amazing eye , coupling this with his skills as an " actors ' director " to create a wonderful piece of cinema .
rob , uk it is , quite frankly , one of the most astonishing examples of a time period being recreated on the screen .
i saw the film in the company of several friends who read the book -lrb- as i did -rrb- and share with me an abiding interest in the civil war era .
minghella did not strike a single false note .
truly magnificent .
robert del valle , usa superb central performances from law and kidman , beautifully photographed - an all round high quality production .
anthony minghella has served up another excellent and riveting film without resorting to lots of contrived dramatic action and explosions -lrb- well ok apart from the big mother at the start -rrb- .
a truly tender and moving yarn without a drop of the ususal hollywood sentimentality .
excellent antidote to love actually .
roberto , uk what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
richard sherlock , uk beautifully shot , and a very accessible film .
kudos to ray winstone and jude law for nailing their roles .
i thought nicole kidman 's accent slipped on occasion .
what was n't to enjoy ?
simon , uk / usa an average film .
the film would have benefited greatly from having the utterly pointless sex scenes remove - which would then have dropped it down a rating and opened it up to a wider audience .
the point of these scenes could have been put across just as powerfully if they were only drunk , but no films these days must have pointless sex and bare flesh on display regardless .
in addition , although most of the characterisation was well constructed , there was little chemistry between the law and kidman which only served to weaken the whole structure on which the story is based .
what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
unlike the book , there was no reference to the slaves working in cold mountain and the tension in the relationships .
it seems odd that this was completely dropped and yet the story kept within the civil war period .
finally , the ending was also very disappointing - should have kept the original .
if in doubt go with the author not a screenwriter who 's hacking a work about .
overall - not bad but could do a lot better .
rivchard sherlock , uk best film of 2003 .
wonderful cinematography , excellent performances and a beautifully paced film that enraptures from start to finish , greatly enjoyed by an audience that applauded loudly at the end .
that says it all .
congratulations to a wonderful cast and crew , especially anthony minghella and iain smith .
you guys deserve an oscar for this one .
joanna , long island , new york brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann bill cahuasa , uk a fine cast , some top class acting , but still a blatant oscar vehicle .
i hope -lrb- for the creditability of the oscars -rrb- that cold mountain does n't win best film .
chatts , uk a genuinely fantastic piece of film making .
the cinematography was phenomenal .
we need to get over this issue about some films being too long .
bottom line , you ca n't make a 300 page book into a 90 minute film without butchering it .
this story needed the time to draw us in and develop the charecters .
that is what gets mangella the casts that he does in all his films .
storytelling is not compromised .
brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann .
the central romance was brilliantly played out .
it is the fact that the two lovers are both going through their own individual hells and the hope of the other gives them the strength to continue and grow as people that gives the film its resonance .
bill cahusac , united kingdom i -lrb- mostly -rrb- disagree with the review .
yes , there was some judicious cutting , and renee zellweger 's accent took a little time to settle down , but i thought that the acting , especially by jude law and p s hoffman , was excellent .
the romance may have been a little uninspriring , with ada being not particularly lovable , but then i thought the romance in the english patient was too , with both main characters being thoroughly unpleasant .
it did n't mean the film itself was bad .
a good use of $ 9 and a couple of hours .
alice carter , usa two and a half hours of my life - wasted !
a poorly scripted and unbelievable waste of time - the only redeeming features being the photography and zellweger 's - deliberately ? - comic performance .
it sems to try to be both a romance and an action / adventure and fails at both - if the scripting had been moved more in one direction or the other then - with such a strong cast - it would have fared far better .
in trying to encapsulate both genres , i fear the director will turn off lovers of both .
roger stout , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical oscar material dan cross , uk i thought it was a beautiful well acted and shot film that moved me a few times to the point of tears and had me crossing my fingers at the end for jude law to survive .
i fantastic tribute to the book .
sarah nelson , england it was n't a happy film , but the production was very well done and the acting generally brilliant .
cold mountain reminded me of the english patient in some aspects .
lots of bad things happening to people in wars , nasty brutish local big man , sumptuous scenery and lots of oscar-worthy detail .
mike hawkes , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical " oscar material " .
for my part , i almost fell asleep twice trying to stay interested but the actor 's plight did n't come over and grab my attention at all .
dan cross , uk against the current crop of heavy action films cold mountain stands out as a wonderfully moving , beautifully filmed story of a tragic love story in it 's finest mould .
i loved it .
i did n't notice the time pass and while noticing the differences between novel and film i was still gripped and moved all the way through .
kate , uk it was a good moved ruined by nicole kidman , renee zellwegger was great in this movie but it was a bit long for me .
nicky , uk boy , was i disappointed in cold mountain .
the story line was too drawn out and non-believable .
the movie was drawn out .
the acting was all right .
actually , the one who stole the movie was renee zellwegger .
she was at least spunky .
hope the movie does not win any oscars .
rhonda , usa i was terribly disappointed with cold mountain .
i found myself wondering what else could possibly go wrong for these poor souls ... and found out in the end !
what a horrible movie !
only good things in it were renee zellweger and jude law .
brenda , canada jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable evelyn hong , england great film apart from poor nicole - pretty as she is i just do n't see how she gets cast in roles with deep passionate love at their centre .
where 's the chemistry ?
it looked like she filmed her bits separately from the rest of the cast -lrb- as is usual with her films -rrb- .
oh - and martin from the uk - the film was based on a book which was n't about the american civil war or slavery but about inman 's journey -lrb- undertones of homer 's odyssey -rrb- .
jane , london , england an overlong , worthy , competent , clearly miramax-funded film , with the obligatory ' character ' part for philip seymour hoffman .
a more cynically oscar-courting movie has not been seen for some time .
nicole is meant to be a destitute farmer , so why does it always look like mrs max factor has just slapped on some more powder ?
and in the closing scenes , i 'm sure she 's got tinted contacts in .
what utter contempt minghella must have for the audience .
rupert cousens , uk overblown , waffly , historically inaccurate , pretentious - so sugary i kept checking the state of my teeth .
fiona starkey-norman , uk the film was far too long .
stricter editing on the battle scenes would have made it much better .
there was too much violence and sex .
jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable .
overall it was a big disappointment for me seeing the film - i felt it was a waste of time .
evelyn hong , england inman 's journey home from the battlefield was slow , painful and seemed like it would never end : having watched cold mountain i know how he felt .
tedious and self indulgent .
andrew ferguson , scotland excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent dave golding , uk i found the film to be a very well put together story with an excellent story line .
all the actors were magnificent in their roles , ray winstone and donald sutherland were a treat to watch .
the length of the film only helped to show the tribulations faced by jude law on his mission homewards .
all things said and done , there is a place for films like this and we should be grateful that there are people who are still prepared to make them despite of the critics opinions .
john boyle , uk enjoyable in parts and a good story , but far too long and drawn out throughout .
martyn , uk i think the film works very well and rather than spoon feeding us the romance lets us take a leap of faith with the characters .
given that they have very little onscreen time together , i think both law and especially kidman quickly established their passion for each other which sustains them - and the film for its epic journey .
graham thomas , uk excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent .
dave golding , uk a great film with fine performances from jude law , nicole kidman and renee zellweger - and good work from donald sutherland , eileen atkins , philip seymour hoffman and charlie hunnam in their supporting roles .
the battle scene in the first 15 minutes makes grim but compelling viewing , and from there on , the film really takes hold of you .
andrew buckingham , london wonderful , aside from nicole kidman , who left me cold and thus ruined the main reason for the quest .
holly , uk the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery martin , uk i did n't enjoy the english patient and i thought cold mountain only a little better .
overlong , slow , it ai n't no gone with the wind .
i could n't care about the two leads and the outcome of their relationship .
the supporting cast were good though .
it is the sort of film that the academy awards loves , which is unfortunate for peter jackson as the return of the king was a masterpiece and should win best film and best director .
lynda burns , edinburgh , scotland on his return jude law did an excellent impression of clint eastwood , looking cool as can be in cowboy designer stubble in the comany of fine women and perfectly delivering one-liners .. have you been shot ?
" not lately " .
steve w , uk beautifully filmed and superbly cast .
an enjoyable story which is given the time to develop .
minghella won me over with this film , i found the english patient unbearably dull .
steve , england brilliant , gorgeous - what over-acting from zellweger ? ? ? ? ? ?
some reviewers over-analyse everything ! ! ! !
martin garvey , uk cold mountain is another example of meaningless film-making - the characters are not rooted in historical reality .
the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery .
martin , uk sort of deliverance with war but really worth the watching at a cinema as its a very ' big ' film .
i thought it was better than the english patient and the romance restrained which was nice for a change !
jude law is gorgeous too .
trina , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was absolutely wonderful .
i read the book over 4 years ago and it lived up to all my expectations .
i laughed and sobbed through most of the movie and thought about it for days afterwards .
the acting was first class although i did notice southern accents occasionally slipping -lrb- yes , you ray winstone ! -rrb- but i do n't think any of the actors were from the deep south so i forgive them .
all in all totally tops ! ! ! ! !
emma , usa -lrb- originally uk -rrb- phew ! !
a very hard slog up a treacherous mountain is what i would compare sitting through this film to .
somewhat entertaining in a " i 've done it ! " kind of way .
thank god for renee zellwegger 's arrival half way through to save us from the ever pouting , eternally well-dressed nicole kidman .
dan rawlings , australia cold mountain - an absorbing and enjoyable film beautifully shot .
on the downside jude law was miscast as inman and it was difficult to warm to either of the two central characters -lrb- kidman and law -rrb- .
a missed opportunity in some respects mr minghella !
dave , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing .
mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was exceptional piece of filmmaking .
true , it did require patience but i was blown away by the performances of all the main cast particularly jude law , it was beautifuly shot and acted and i found it genuinely moving .
richard , ireland an excellent adventure .
kim howe , uk renee zellweger gives a funny performance and steals every scene she is in - she deserves the oscar buzz for best supporting actress .
otherwise , i agree with the bbc reviewer , the movie is fairly uninspiring .
andrea , canada i believe someone should ask charles frazier what he thinks of the film of his novel .
i think he would be horrified .
it is amazing how long the film is when you consider how much has been cut from the book .
hardly any of the beauty and depth of the novel survives the transition to the screen .
the decision to grow the teague character to accommodate the slender talents of ray winstone is a mistake .
much of the script as a whole is indeed clunky , no mean feat when the language of the novel is light and precise .
it is as if anthony minghella was jealous of the creativity and richness of the novel and has deliberately set out to jettison them .
a huge disappointment .
alan brown , england just as boring as the english patient , but without the pay-off of a big lead dying .
caroline , uk as mentioned - it was english patient meets gone with the wind .
long , with an abundance of triteness but still containing some memorable scenes and acting performances .
what was interesting is how nicole kidman 's character could be starving and freezing and yet have such a perfect complexion , clean hands and manage to keep all but four strands of hair in place .
what an amazing woman .
fred roboz , usa it takes a while to get over jude law and ray winstone putting on american accents , but once you do it 's well worth it .
some very moving moments .
george cockerill , uk utterly terrible .
one of the worst films i 've seen in a long while .
utterly pointless , lacking inspiration , hammy acting , it had nothing save for a few excellent scenes from law and some smouldering from portman .
kidman wasted , zellweger irritating .
philip seymour hoffman was excellent but his character was completely pointless and should have been left out to get the misery down to under 2 hours .
dire .
and 2 1/2 hours long .
graham , uk in the civil war movie cold mountain nicole kidman has the looks , temperament and acting ability of the queen 's corgis dog .
she is now going to star in a movie remake of the television series bewitched as samantha .
samantha at times would chnage into a corgis dog so this is a fitting role for nicole kidman .
clory jane mostek , united states of america a really good film with beautiful snowy scenes and thought provoking civil war scenes .
renee provided the light relief with great witty lines and was my particular favourite .
jude law and all the supporting cast did a brilliant job , but sadly nicole was a bit flat .
even so , i recommend people go and see cold mountain .
janet bangs , uk why was n't this film shot in north carolina ?
duh !
we are the third largest film center in the u.s. , with all the technical support and amenities needed for film professionals , yet it was filmed , for the most part , in europe .
would 've been a real winner had it been filmed on native soil .
joan , raleigh , nc usa while good in parts the film can not get past a central problem - the romantic leads are so rarely seen together that the underlying romance is unbelievable .
add in zellwegger 's ham acting and kidman 's immaculate presentation -lrb- farm girl with perfect make-up ? -rrb- and this one fails to involve .
richard moore , uk i enjoyed the film very much .
the leads are captivating .
i was especially impressed by the production design , the rural mountain community and scenery which looks truly authentic to western north carolina , where i live .
frazier 's novel is a masterpiece in its own right and likewise minghella 's film , a real treat for us to see a story so close to home up there on the screen .
i wish much success for cold mountain come awards time .
lara , usa one of the most beautiful stories you will ever see on film .
the acting was superb , especially rene zellweiger .
despair , tragedy , beauty , love , and hope .
michael fox , usa bored , bored , bored - finally gave in and walked out before the end , painfully bored .
michael edney , uk a finely crafted film with many excellent cast choices and performances , especially in the minor roles .
the attraction between ada and inman is very powerful , a subtle subtext in the book and the film does not fully capture that .
mike , uk i dont know what it is about minghella , but he seems to make otherwise good and sensual actors into wooden tops .
the english patient was cold and pretentious , but cold mountain was simply appalling .
how can all these good people giving all these good reviews have been taken in by such a truly awful film - the only saving grace -lrb- like in the english patient -rrb- was the scenery but if i had wanted to go to watch a travel film , i would have chosen to go . -lrb- oh - and renee zellwegger - what a relief she was -rrb- .
does the director instruct the love scenes by numbers - they look like it .
sorry fellow filmgoers , this appalling , insincere and pretentious film should not be up for any awards - but i felt the same for the english patient , and will never bother to give minghella the benefit of the doubt again .
sue , england your cold mountain reviewer is a bit harsh .
granted , the accents of some of the characters are irritating or unintentionally amusing as they keep slipping from southern american drawl into english , or mangled cockney in ray winstone 's case , but it 's still a beautifully shot , moving love story with great performances from kidman , law , hoffman and portman .
zellweger is outclassed and hams it up as a result , but you need some light relief in what is otherwise a very tragic story .
i 'm glad minghella has stayed true to the novel and kept the ending .
i thought kidman just slightly too old and wise for the role of ada but she was convincing all the same .
tammy , uk did matthew slater see the same film ?
this film blew me away !
hopefully cold mountain will clean up at the oscars and we can finally get over the bored of the rings hype .

director anthony minghella 's take on love in the desert produced the award-winning film the english patient .
this time , the backdrop for his epic love story is the remote hills of north carolina .
but it is hard to imagine cinema-goers warming to cold mountain .
minghella is aiming for a modern gone with the wind , but only manages a forrest gump with better acting and prettier scenery .
the film stars law and kidman as lovers uprooted by a war that changed a nation .
zellweger gives kidman a helping hand based on charles frazier 's award-winning novel , law plays wp inman , a hero in the best tradition of strong , silent types .
kidman is ada monroe , the very picture of old southern manners .
ada arrives on the scene when her preacher father -lrb- donald sutherland -rrb- leaves charleston for the more pastoral pleasures of cold mountain .
she meets inman and two or three clunkily-scripted scenes later we have a backwoods version of scarlett o 'hara and ashley wilkes .
but all is not what it seems in the garden of eden .
war is around the corner and the rather useless ada is also being romantically pursued by ray winstone 's bearded beast , teague .
inman begins a ulysses-like trek home and the journey , like the film , is long and arduous .
law -lrb- pictured -rrb- and kidman spend little screen time together it is not without incident , however , with plenty of portentous sentiment and some very good acting .
inman encounters a who 's who of hollywood talent - philip seymour hoffman , giovanni ribisi and natalie portman - who all either help , hinder or tempt our hero from his righteous path back to the woman he loves .
meanwhile , an over-acting but green-fingered renee zellweger arrives to help ada out on the farm .
but as good as parts of this film are - the battle scenes , the law and portman vignette , seymour hoffman 's frisky clergyman - cold mountain can not overcome the problems of its central uninspiring romance .
minghella 's previous oscars triumph , the english patient may not have suited all tastes , but at least the passion between its stars ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas was believable .

what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
unlike the book , there was no reference to the slaves working in cold mountain and the tension in the relationships .
it seems odd that this was completely dropped and yet the story kept within the civil war period .
finally , the ending was also very disappointing - should have kept the original .
if in doubt go with the author not a screenwriter who 's hacking a work about .
overall - not bad but could do a lot better .
rivchard sherlock , uk best film of 2003 .
wonderful cinematography , excellent performances and a beautifully paced film that enraptures from start to finish , greatly enjoyed by an audience that applauded loudly at the end .
that says it all .
congratulations to a wonderful cast and crew , especially anthony minghella and iain smith .
you guys deserve an oscar for this one .
joanna , long island , new york brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann bill cahuasa , uk a fine cast , some top class acting , but still a blatant oscar vehicle .
i hope -lrb- for the creditability of the oscars -rrb- that cold mountain does n't win best film .
chatts , uk a genuinely fantastic piece of film making .
the cinematography was phenomenal .
we need to get over this issue about some films being too long .
bottom line , you ca n't make a 300 page book into a 90 minute film without butchering it .
this story needed the time to draw us in and develop the charecters .
that is what gets mangella the casts that he does in all his films .
storytelling is not compromised .
brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann .
the central romance was brilliantly played out .
it is the fact that the two lovers are both going through their own individual hells and the hope of the other gives them the strength to continue and grow as people that gives the film its resonance .
bill cahusac , united kingdom i -lrb- mostly -rrb- disagree with the review .
yes , there was some judicious cutting , and renee zellweger 's accent took a little time to settle down , but i thought that the acting , especially by jude law and p s hoffman , was excellent .
the romance may have been a little uninspriring , with ada being not particularly lovable , but then i thought the romance in the english patient was too , with both main characters being thoroughly unpleasant .
it did n't mean the film itself was bad .
a good use of $ 9 and a couple of hours .
alice carter , usa two and a half hours of my life - wasted !
a poorly scripted and unbelievable waste of time - the only redeeming features being the photography and zellweger 's - deliberately ? - comic performance .
it sems to try to be both a romance and an action / adventure and fails at both - if the scripting had been moved more in one direction or the other then - with such a strong cast - it would have fared far better .
in trying to encapsulate both genres , i fear the director will turn off lovers of both .
roger stout , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical oscar material dan cross , uk i thought it was a beautiful well acted and shot film that moved me a few times to the point of tears and had me crossing my fingers at the end for jude law to survive .
i fantastic tribute to the book .
sarah nelson , england it was n't a happy film , but the production was very well done and the acting generally brilliant .
cold mountain reminded me of the english patient in some aspects .
lots of bad things happening to people in wars , nasty brutish local big man , sumptuous scenery and lots of oscar-worthy detail .
mike hawkes , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical " oscar material " .
for my part , i almost fell asleep twice trying to stay interested but the actor 's plight did n't come over and grab my attention at all .
dan cross , uk against the current crop of heavy action films cold mountain stands out as a wonderfully moving , beautifully filmed story of a tragic love story in it 's finest mould .
i loved it .
i did n't notice the time pass and while noticing the differences between novel and film i was still gripped and moved all the way through .
kate , uk it was a good moved ruined by nicole kidman , renee zellwegger was great in this movie but it was a bit long for me .
nicky , uk boy , was i disappointed in cold mountain .
the story line was too drawn out and non-believable .
the movie was drawn out .
the acting was all right .
actually , the one who stole the movie was renee zellwegger .
she was at least spunky .
hope the movie does not win any oscars .
rhonda , usa i was terribly disappointed with cold mountain .
i found myself wondering what else could possibly go wrong for these poor souls ... and found out in the end !
what a horrible movie !
only good things in it were renee zellweger and jude law .
brenda , canada jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable evelyn hong , england great film apart from poor nicole - pretty as she is i just do n't see how she gets cast in roles with deep passionate love at their centre .
where 's the chemistry ?
it looked like she filmed her bits separately from the rest of the cast -lrb- as is usual with her films -rrb- .
oh - and martin from the uk - the film was based on a book which was n't about the american civil war or slavery but about inman 's journey -lrb- undertones of homer 's odyssey -rrb- .
jane , london , england an overlong , worthy , competent , clearly miramax-funded film , with the obligatory ' character ' part for philip seymour hoffman .
a more cynically oscar-courting movie has not been seen for some time .
nicole is meant to be a destitute farmer , so why does it always look like mrs max factor has just slapped on some more powder ?
and in the closing scenes , i 'm sure she 's got tinted contacts in .
what utter contempt minghella must have for the audience .
rupert cousens , uk overblown , waffly , historically inaccurate , pretentious - so sugary i kept checking the state of my teeth .
fiona starkey-norman , uk the film was far too long .
stricter editing on the battle scenes would have made it much better .
there was too much violence and sex .
jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable .
overall it was a big disappointment for me seeing the film - i felt it was a waste of time .
evelyn hong , england inman 's journey home from the battlefield was slow , painful and seemed like it would never end : having watched cold mountain i know how he felt .
tedious and self indulgent .
andrew ferguson , scotland excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent dave golding , uk i found the film to be a very well put together story with an excellent story line .
all the actors were magnificent in their roles , ray winstone and donald sutherland were a treat to watch .
the length of the film only helped to show the tribulations faced by jude law on his mission homewards .
all things said and done , there is a place for films like this and we should be grateful that there are people who are still prepared to make them despite of the critics opinions .
john boyle , uk enjoyable in parts and a good story , but far too long and drawn out throughout .
martyn , uk i think the film works very well and rather than spoon feeding us the romance lets us take a leap of faith with the characters .
given that they have very little onscreen time together , i think both law and especially kidman quickly established their passion for each other which sustains them - and the film for its epic journey .
graham thomas , uk excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent .
dave golding , uk a great film with fine performances from jude law , nicole kidman and renee zellweger - and good work from donald sutherland , eileen atkins , philip seymour hoffman and charlie hunnam in their supporting roles .
the battle scene in the first 15 minutes makes grim but compelling viewing , and from there on , the film really takes hold of you .
andrew buckingham , london wonderful , aside from nicole kidman , who left me cold and thus ruined the main reason for the quest .
holly , uk the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery martin , uk i did n't enjoy the english patient and i thought cold mountain only a little better .
overlong , slow , it ai n't no gone with the wind .
i could n't care about the two leads and the outcome of their relationship .
the supporting cast were good though .
it is the sort of film that the academy awards loves , which is unfortunate for peter jackson as the return of the king was a masterpiece and should win best film and best director .
lynda burns , edinburgh , scotland on his return jude law did an excellent impression of clint eastwood , looking cool as can be in cowboy designer stubble in the comany of fine women and perfectly delivering one-liners .. have you been shot ?
" not lately " .
steve w , uk beautifully filmed and superbly cast .
an enjoyable story which is given the time to develop .
minghella won me over with this film , i found the english patient unbearably dull .
steve , england brilliant , gorgeous - what over-acting from zellweger ? ? ? ? ? ?
some reviewers over-analyse everything ! ! ! !
martin garvey , uk cold mountain is another example of meaningless film-making - the characters are not rooted in historical reality .
the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery .
martin , uk sort of deliverance with war but really worth the watching at a cinema as its a very ' big ' film .
i thought it was better than the english patient and the romance restrained which was nice for a change !
jude law is gorgeous too .
trina , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was absolutely wonderful .
i read the book over 4 years ago and it lived up to all my expectations .
i laughed and sobbed through most of the movie and thought about it for days afterwards .
the acting was first class although i did notice southern accents occasionally slipping -lrb- yes , you ray winstone ! -rrb- but i do n't think any of the actors were from the deep south so i forgive them .
all in all totally tops ! ! ! ! !
emma , usa -lrb- originally uk -rrb- phew ! !
a very hard slog up a treacherous mountain is what i would compare sitting through this film to .
somewhat entertaining in a " i 've done it ! " kind of way .
thank god for renee zellwegger 's arrival half way through to save us from the ever pouting , eternally well-dressed nicole kidman .
dan rawlings , australia cold mountain - an absorbing and enjoyable film beautifully shot .
on the downside jude law was miscast as inman and it was difficult to warm to either of the two central characters -lrb- kidman and law -rrb- .
a missed opportunity in some respects mr minghella !
dave , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing .
mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was exceptional piece of filmmaking .
true , it did require patience but i was blown away by the performances of all the main cast particularly jude law , it was beautifuly shot and acted and i found it genuinely moving .
richard , ireland an excellent adventure .
kim howe , uk renee zellweger gives a funny performance and steals every scene she is in - she deserves the oscar buzz for best supporting actress .
otherwise , i agree with the bbc reviewer , the movie is fairly uninspiring .
andrea , canada i believe someone should ask charles frazier what he thinks of the film of his novel .
i think he would be horrified .
it is amazing how long the film is when you consider how much has been cut from the book .
hardly any of the beauty and depth of the novel survives the transition to the screen .
the decision to grow the teague character to accommodate the slender talents of ray winstone is a mistake .
much of the script as a whole is indeed clunky , no mean feat when the language of the novel is light and precise .
it is as if anthony minghella was jealous of the creativity and richness of the novel and has deliberately set out to jettison them .
a huge disappointment .
alan brown , england just as boring as the english patient , but without the pay-off of a big lead dying .
caroline , uk as mentioned - it was english patient meets gone with the wind .
long , with an abundance of triteness but still containing some memorable scenes and acting performances .
what was interesting is how nicole kidman 's character could be starving and freezing and yet have such a perfect complexion , clean hands and manage to keep all but four strands of hair in place .
what an amazing woman .
fred roboz , usa it takes a while to get over jude law and ray winstone putting on american accents , but once you do it 's well worth it .
some very moving moments .
george cockerill , uk utterly terrible .
one of the worst films i 've seen in a long while .
utterly pointless , lacking inspiration , hammy acting , it had nothing save for a few excellent scenes from law and some smouldering from portman .
kidman wasted , zellweger irritating .
philip seymour hoffman was excellent but his character was completely pointless and should have been left out to get the misery down to under 2 hours .
dire .
and 2 1/2 hours long .
graham , uk in the civil war movie cold mountain nicole kidman has the looks , temperament and acting ability of the queen 's corgis dog .
she is now going to star in a movie remake of the television series bewitched as samantha .
samantha at times would chnage into a corgis dog so this is a fitting role for nicole kidman .
clory jane mostek , united states of america a really good film with beautiful snowy scenes and thought provoking civil war scenes .
renee provided the light relief with great witty lines and was my particular favourite .
jude law and all the supporting cast did a brilliant job , but sadly nicole was a bit flat .
even so , i recommend people go and see cold mountain .
janet bangs , uk why was n't this film shot in north carolina ?
duh !
we are the third largest film center in the u.s. , with all the technical support and amenities needed for film professionals , yet it was filmed , for the most part , in europe .
would 've been a real winner had it been filmed on native soil .
joan , raleigh , nc usa while good in parts the film can not get past a central problem - the romantic leads are so rarely seen together that the underlying romance is unbelievable .
add in zellwegger 's ham acting and kidman 's immaculate presentation -lrb- farm girl with perfect make-up ? -rrb- and this one fails to involve .
richard moore , uk i enjoyed the film very much .
the leads are captivating .
i was especially impressed by the production design , the rural mountain community and scenery which looks truly authentic to western north carolina , where i live .
frazier 's novel is a masterpiece in its own right and likewise minghella 's film , a real treat for us to see a story so close to home up there on the screen .
i wish much success for cold mountain come awards time .
lara , usa one of the most beautiful stories you will ever see on film .
the acting was superb , especially rene zellweiger .
despair , tragedy , beauty , love , and hope .
michael fox , usa bored , bored , bored - finally gave in and walked out before the end , painfully bored .
michael edney , uk a finely crafted film with many excellent cast choices and performances , especially in the minor roles .
the attraction between ada and inman is very powerful , a subtle subtext in the book and the film does not fully capture that .
mike , uk i dont know what it is about minghella , but he seems to make otherwise good and sensual actors into wooden tops .
the english patient was cold and pretentious , but cold mountain was simply appalling .
how can all these good people giving all these good reviews have been taken in by such a truly awful film - the only saving grace -lrb- like in the english patient -rrb- was the scenery but if i had wanted to go to watch a travel film , i would have chosen to go . -lrb- oh - and renee zellwegger - what a relief she was -rrb- .
does the director instruct the love scenes by numbers - they look like it .
sorry fellow filmgoers , this appalling , insincere and pretentious film should not be up for any awards - but i felt the same for the english patient , and will never bother to give minghella the benefit of the doubt again .
sue , england your cold mountain reviewer is a bit harsh .
granted , the accents of some of the characters are irritating or unintentionally amusing as they keep slipping from southern american drawl into english , or mangled cockney in ray winstone 's case , but it 's still a beautifully shot , moving love story with great performances from kidman , law , hoffman and portman .
zellweger is outclassed and hams it up as a result , but you need some light relief in what is otherwise a very tragic story .
i 'm glad minghella has stayed true to the novel and kept the ending .
i thought kidman just slightly too old and wise for the role of ada but she was convincing all the same .
tammy , uk did matthew slater see the same film ?
this film blew me away !
hopefully cold mountain will clean up at the oscars and we can finally get over the bored of the rings hype .

director anthony minghella 's take on love in the desert produced the award-winning film the english patient .
this time , the backdrop for his epic love story is the remote hills of north carolina .
but it is hard to imagine cinema-goers warming to cold mountain .
minghella is aiming for a modern gone with the wind , but only manages a forrest gump with better acting and prettier scenery .
the film stars law and kidman as lovers uprooted by a war that changed a nation .
zellweger gives kidman a helping hand based on charles frazier 's award-winning novel , law plays wp inman , a hero in the best tradition of strong , silent types .
kidman is ada monroe , the very picture of old southern manners .
ada arrives on the scene when her preacher father -lrb- donald sutherland -rrb- leaves charleston for the more pastoral pleasures of cold mountain .
she meets inman and two or three clunkily-scripted scenes later we have a backwoods version of scarlett o 'hara and ashley wilkes .
but all is not what it seems in the garden of eden .
war is around the corner and the rather useless ada is also being romantically pursued by ray winstone 's bearded beast , teague .
inman begins a ulysses-like trek home and the journey , like the film , is long and arduous .
law -lrb- pictured -rrb- and kidman spend little screen time together it is not without incident , however , with plenty of portentous sentiment and some very good acting .
inman encounters a who 's who of hollywood talent - philip seymour hoffman , giovanni ribisi and natalie portman - who all either help , hinder or tempt our hero from his righteous path back to the woman he loves .
meanwhile , an over-acting but green-fingered renee zellweger arrives to help ada out on the farm .
but as good as parts of this film are - the battle scenes , the law and portman vignette , seymour hoffman 's frisky clergyman - cold mountain can not overcome the problems of its central uninspiring romance .
minghella 's previous oscars triumph , the english patient may not have suited all tastes , but at least the passion between its stars ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas was believable .
cold mountain is out now in the uk - the views page is now closed but please see below for a selection of your comments .
a beautiful piece of film making , david lean is alive and well and trapped inside mingella 's head .
the scenery alone is worth the ticket price , but then you add in fine performances , a well written script , and some stunning camera work and effects .
this film is so refreshingly grown-up .
alice thomas , uk beautiful scenery , some excellent acting -lrb- although i felt zellwegger was irritatingly caricaturing her role -rrb- , and some great scenes that really had me hooked .
but , by the time the film ended , the whole context and backdrop of the film , i.e. the civil war , seemed to have disappeared into insignificance , and i was left wondering what point the film had made .
for me , it had failed to make one .
claire , london , uk it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold christina , canada cold mountain is one of those films where the whole is somehow less than the sum of the parts .
had this not been so then it would have been absolutely magnificent !
thus it does n't quite hit the peaks of minghella 's others -lrb- patient / ripley -rrb- but at the same time it 's a very decent cinematic experience and full marks to him and the miramax team for undertaking it .
the fact that i 'm still turning it over means that it has left a strong impression whatever its minor shortcomings .
john coope , uk about 20 minutes too long -lrb- could have shaved off the gratuitous sex-scene -rrb- , but good performances from all -lrb- although the decision to change zellweger 's ruby from a cherokee but not the dialogue expressed by , or to , her , was a strange one -rrb- .
even on the big screen not as visually captivating as it could have been ; it had no scale , to me , and seemed ' small ' .
enjoyable enough .
alex hornby , uk a bit long although i thought the acting was generally good .
the most jarring problems for me , being from the southern us , were the accents .
jude law 's was impeccable but nicole kidman , ray winstone and philip seymour hoffman had some serious slips with their accent work .
rachel , usa an exceptional piece of entertainment .
followed the book well and was more than a match for the normal run-of-the-mill hollywood blockbusters .
jeremy radcliffe , england it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold .
i think mainly because of kidman unfortunately - she was just too beautiful and clean to believable - perfect makeup at all times etc .
law was wonderful though .
christina , canada this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure rob , uk truly a sign of a good film when you do not realise how long you have been sitting in the cinema !
j , uk i saw it for the performance from jack white as georgia ... i did n't think much of the rest of it .
katey , uk i thought nicole kidman was great .
a stunning piece of work .
emily , uk a gripping epic ; difficult to watch at times due to gritty violent scenes .
the cinematography is very , very good .
renée zellweger is undoubtedly the star - she 's outstanding as ruby .
but what stops the film from being , in my opinion , a classic is the lack of a real romantic payoff for the central characters , ada and inman .
the penultimate scene was incredibly depressing and disappointing , leaving my overall impression of the film as - well , a downer .
wendy , uk this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure .
excellent performances all round , with nicole kidman 's unutterably expressive visage again proving that she 's one of the greatest actresses of her generation .
minghella has an amazing eye , coupling this with his skills as an " actors ' director " to create a wonderful piece of cinema .
rob , uk it is , quite frankly , one of the most astonishing examples of a time period being recreated on the screen .
i saw the film in the company of several friends who read the book -lrb- as i did -rrb- and share with me an abiding interest in the civil war era .
minghella did not strike a single false note .
truly magnificent .
robert del valle , usa superb central performances from law and kidman , beautifully photographed - an all round high quality production .
anthony minghella has served up another excellent and riveting film without resorting to lots of contrived dramatic action and explosions -lrb- well ok apart from the big mother at the start -rrb- .
a truly tender and moving yarn without a drop of the ususal hollywood sentimentality .
excellent antidote to love actually .
roberto , uk what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
richard sherlock , uk beautifully shot , and a very accessible film .
kudos to ray winstone and jude law for nailing their roles .
i thought nicole kidman 's accent slipped on occasion .
what was n't to enjoy ?
simon , uk / usa an average film .
the film would have benefited greatly from having the utterly pointless sex scenes remove - which would then have dropped it down a rating and opened it up to a wider audience .
the point of these scenes could have been put across just as powerfully if they were only drunk , but no films these days must have pointless sex and bare flesh on display regardless .
in addition , although most of the characterisation was well constructed , there was little chemistry between the law and kidman which only served to weaken the whole structure on which the story is based .
what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
unlike the book , there was no reference to the slaves working in cold mountain and the tension in the relationships .
it seems odd that this was completely dropped and yet the story kept within the civil war period .
finally , the ending was also very disappointing - should have kept the original .
if in doubt go with the author not a screenwriter who 's hacking a work about .
overall - not bad but could do a lot better .
rivchard sherlock , uk best film of 2003 .
wonderful cinematography , excellent performances and a beautifully paced film that enraptures from start to finish , greatly enjoyed by an audience that applauded loudly at the end .
that says it all .
congratulations to a wonderful cast and crew , especially anthony minghella and iain smith .
you guys deserve an oscar for this one .

rupert cousens , uk overblown , waffly , historically inaccurate , pretentious - so sugary i kept checking the state of my teeth .
fiona starkey-norman , uk the film was far too long .
stricter editing on the battle scenes would have made it much better .
there was too much violence and sex .
jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable .
overall it was a big disappointment for me seeing the film - i felt it was a waste of time .
evelyn hong , england inman 's journey home from the battlefield was slow , painful and seemed like it would never end : having watched cold mountain i know how he felt .
tedious and self indulgent .
andrew ferguson , scotland excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent dave golding , uk i found the film to be a very well put together story with an excellent story line .
all the actors were magnificent in their roles , ray winstone and donald sutherland were a treat to watch .
the length of the film only helped to show the tribulations faced by jude law on his mission homewards .
all things said and done , there is a place for films like this and we should be grateful that there are people who are still prepared to make them despite of the critics opinions .
john boyle , uk enjoyable in parts and a good story , but far too long and drawn out throughout .
martyn , uk i think the film works very well and rather than spoon feeding us the romance lets us take a leap of faith with the characters .
given that they have very little onscreen time together , i think both law and especially kidman quickly established their passion for each other which sustains them - and the film for its epic journey .
graham thomas , uk excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent .
dave golding , uk a great film with fine performances from jude law , nicole kidman and renee zellweger - and good work from donald sutherland , eileen atkins , philip seymour hoffman and charlie hunnam in their supporting roles .
the battle scene in the first 15 minutes makes grim but compelling viewing , and from there on , the film really takes hold of you .
andrew buckingham , london wonderful , aside from nicole kidman , who left me cold and thus ruined the main reason for the quest .
holly , uk the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery martin , uk i did n't enjoy the english patient and i thought cold mountain only a little better .
overlong , slow , it ai n't no gone with the wind .
i could n't care about the two leads and the outcome of their relationship .
the supporting cast were good though .
it is the sort of film that the academy awards loves , which is unfortunate for peter jackson as the return of the king was a masterpiece and should win best film and best director .
lynda burns , edinburgh , scotland on his return jude law did an excellent impression of clint eastwood , looking cool as can be in cowboy designer stubble in the comany of fine women and perfectly delivering one-liners .. have you been shot ?
" not lately " .
steve w , uk beautifully filmed and superbly cast .
an enjoyable story which is given the time to develop .
minghella won me over with this film , i found the english patient unbearably dull .
steve , england brilliant , gorgeous - what over-acting from zellweger ? ? ? ? ? ?
some reviewers over-analyse everything ! ! ! !
martin garvey , uk cold mountain is another example of meaningless film-making - the characters are not rooted in historical reality .
the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery .
martin , uk sort of deliverance with war but really worth the watching at a cinema as its a very ' big ' film .
i thought it was better than the english patient and the romance restrained which was nice for a change !
jude law is gorgeous too .
trina , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was absolutely wonderful .
i read the book over 4 years ago and it lived up to all my expectations .
i laughed and sobbed through most of the movie and thought about it for days afterwards .
the acting was first class although i did notice southern accents occasionally slipping -lrb- yes , you ray winstone ! -rrb- but i do n't think any of the actors were from the deep south so i forgive them .
all in all totally tops ! ! ! ! !
emma , usa -lrb- originally uk -rrb- phew ! !
a very hard slog up a treacherous mountain is what i would compare sitting through this film to .
somewhat entertaining in a " i 've done it ! " kind of way .
thank god for renee zellwegger 's arrival half way through to save us from the ever pouting , eternally well-dressed nicole kidman .
dan rawlings , australia cold mountain - an absorbing and enjoyable film beautifully shot .
on the downside jude law was miscast as inman and it was difficult to warm to either of the two central characters -lrb- kidman and law -rrb- .
a missed opportunity in some respects mr minghella !
dave , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing .
mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was exceptional piece of filmmaking .
true , it did require patience but i was blown away by the performances of all the main cast particularly jude law , it was beautifuly shot and acted and i found it genuinely moving .
richard , ireland an excellent adventure .
kim howe , uk renee zellweger gives a funny performance and steals every scene she is in - she deserves the oscar buzz for best supporting actress .
otherwise , i agree with the bbc reviewer , the movie is fairly uninspiring .
andrea , canada i believe someone should ask charles frazier what he thinks of the film of his novel .
i think he would be horrified .
it is amazing how long the film is when you consider how much has been cut from the book .
hardly any of the beauty and depth of the novel survives the transition to the screen .
the decision to grow the teague character to accommodate the slender talents of ray winstone is a mistake .
much of the script as a whole is indeed clunky , no mean feat when the language of the novel is light and precise .
it is as if anthony minghella was jealous of the creativity and richness of the novel and has deliberately set out to jettison them .
a huge disappointment .
alan brown , england just as boring as the english patient , but without the pay-off of a big lead dying .
caroline , uk as mentioned - it was english patient meets gone with the wind .
long , with an abundance of triteness but still containing some memorable scenes and acting performances .
what was interesting is how nicole kidman 's character could be starving and freezing and yet have such a perfect complexion , clean hands and manage to keep all but four strands of hair in place .
what an amazing woman .
fred roboz , usa it takes a while to get over jude law and ray winstone putting on american accents , but once you do it 's well worth it .
some very moving moments .
george cockerill , uk utterly terrible .
one of the worst films i 've seen in a long while .
utterly pointless , lacking inspiration , hammy acting , it had nothing save for a few excellent scenes from law and some smouldering from portman .
kidman wasted , zellweger irritating .
philip seymour hoffman was excellent but his character was completely pointless and should have been left out to get the misery down to under 2 hours .
dire .
and 2 1/2 hours long .
graham , uk in the civil war movie cold mountain nicole kidman has the looks , temperament and acting ability of the queen 's corgis dog .
she is now going to star in a movie remake of the television series bewitched as samantha .
samantha at times would chnage into a corgis dog so this is a fitting role for nicole kidman .
clory jane mostek , united states of america a really good film with beautiful snowy scenes and thought provoking civil war scenes .
renee provided the light relief with great witty lines and was my particular favourite .
jude law and all the supporting cast did a brilliant job , but sadly nicole was a bit flat .
even so , i recommend people go and see cold mountain .
janet bangs , uk why was n't this film shot in north carolina ?
duh !
we are the third largest film center in the u.s. , with all the technical support and amenities needed for film professionals , yet it was filmed , for the most part , in europe .
would 've been a real winner had it been filmed on native soil .
joan , raleigh , nc usa while good in parts the film can not get past a central problem - the romantic leads are so rarely seen together that the underlying romance is unbelievable .
add in zellwegger 's ham acting and kidman 's immaculate presentation -lrb- farm girl with perfect make-up ? -rrb- and this one fails to involve .
richard moore , uk i enjoyed the film very much .
the leads are captivating .
i was especially impressed by the production design , the rural mountain community and scenery which looks truly authentic to western north carolina , where i live .
frazier 's novel is a masterpiece in its own right and likewise minghella 's film , a real treat for us to see a story so close to home up there on the screen .
i wish much success for cold mountain come awards time .
lara , usa one of the most beautiful stories you will ever see on film .
the acting was superb , especially rene zellweiger .
despair , tragedy , beauty , love , and hope .
michael fox , usa bored , bored , bored - finally gave in and walked out before the end , painfully bored .
michael edney , uk a finely crafted film with many excellent cast choices and performances , especially in the minor roles .
the attraction between ada and inman is very powerful , a subtle subtext in the book and the film does not fully capture that .
mike , uk i dont know what it is about minghella , but he seems to make otherwise good and sensual actors into wooden tops .
the english patient was cold and pretentious , but cold mountain was simply appalling .
how can all these good people giving all these good reviews have been taken in by such a truly awful film - the only saving grace -lrb- like in the english patient -rrb- was the scenery but if i had wanted to go to watch a travel film , i would have chosen to go . -lrb- oh - and renee zellwegger - what a relief she was -rrb- .
does the director instruct the love scenes by numbers - they look like it .
sorry fellow filmgoers , this appalling , insincere and pretentious film should not be up for any awards - but i felt the same for the english patient , and will never bother to give minghella the benefit of the doubt again .
sue , england your cold mountain reviewer is a bit harsh .
granted , the accents of some of the characters are irritating or unintentionally amusing as they keep slipping from southern american drawl into english , or mangled cockney in ray winstone 's case , but it 's still a beautifully shot , moving love story with great performances from kidman , law , hoffman and portman .
zellweger is outclassed and hams it up as a result , but you need some light relief in what is otherwise a very tragic story .
i 'm glad minghella has stayed true to the novel and kept the ending .
i thought kidman just slightly too old and wise for the role of ada but she was convincing all the same .
tammy , uk did matthew slater see the same film ?
this film blew me away !
hopefully cold mountain will clean up at the oscars and we can finally get over the bored of the rings hype .

director anthony minghella 's take on love in the desert produced the award-winning film the english patient .
this time , the backdrop for his epic love story is the remote hills of north carolina .
but it is hard to imagine cinema-goers warming to cold mountain .
minghella is aiming for a modern gone with the wind , but only manages a forrest gump with better acting and prettier scenery .
the film stars law and kidman as lovers uprooted by a war that changed a nation .
zellweger gives kidman a helping hand based on charles frazier 's award-winning novel , law plays wp inman , a hero in the best tradition of strong , silent types .
kidman is ada monroe , the very picture of old southern manners .
ada arrives on the scene when her preacher father -lrb- donald sutherland -rrb- leaves charleston for the more pastoral pleasures of cold mountain .
she meets inman and two or three clunkily-scripted scenes later we have a backwoods version of scarlett o 'hara and ashley wilkes .
but all is not what it seems in the garden of eden .
war is around the corner and the rather useless ada is also being romantically pursued by ray winstone 's bearded beast , teague .
inman begins a ulysses-like trek home and the journey , like the film , is long and arduous .
law -lrb- pictured -rrb- and kidman spend little screen time together it is not without incident , however , with plenty of portentous sentiment and some very good acting .
inman encounters a who 's who of hollywood talent - philip seymour hoffman , giovanni ribisi and natalie portman - who all either help , hinder or tempt our hero from his righteous path back to the woman he loves .
meanwhile , an over-acting but green-fingered renee zellweger arrives to help ada out on the farm .
but as good as parts of this film are - the battle scenes , the law and portman vignette , seymour hoffman 's frisky clergyman - cold mountain can not overcome the problems of its central uninspiring romance .
minghella 's previous oscars triumph , the english patient may not have suited all tastes , but at least the passion between its stars ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas was believable .
cold mountain is out now in the uk - the views page is now closed but please see below for a selection of your comments .
a beautiful piece of film making , david lean is alive and well and trapped inside mingella 's head .
the scenery alone is worth the ticket price , but then you add in fine performances , a well written script , and some stunning camera work and effects .
this film is so refreshingly grown-up .
alice thomas , uk beautiful scenery , some excellent acting -lrb- although i felt zellwegger was irritatingly caricaturing her role -rrb- , and some great scenes that really had me hooked .
but , by the time the film ended , the whole context and backdrop of the film , i.e. the civil war , seemed to have disappeared into insignificance , and i was left wondering what point the film had made .
for me , it had failed to make one .
claire , london , uk it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold christina , canada cold mountain is one of those films where the whole is somehow less than the sum of the parts .
had this not been so then it would have been absolutely magnificent !
thus it does n't quite hit the peaks of minghella 's others -lrb- patient / ripley -rrb- but at the same time it 's a very decent cinematic experience and full marks to him and the miramax team for undertaking it .
the fact that i 'm still turning it over means that it has left a strong impression whatever its minor shortcomings .
john coope , uk about 20 minutes too long -lrb- could have shaved off the gratuitous sex-scene -rrb- , but good performances from all -lrb- although the decision to change zellweger 's ruby from a cherokee but not the dialogue expressed by , or to , her , was a strange one -rrb- .
even on the big screen not as visually captivating as it could have been ; it had no scale , to me , and seemed ' small ' .
enjoyable enough .
alex hornby , uk a bit long although i thought the acting was generally good .
the most jarring problems for me , being from the southern us , were the accents .
jude law 's was impeccable but nicole kidman , ray winstone and philip seymour hoffman had some serious slips with their accent work .
rachel , usa an exceptional piece of entertainment .
followed the book well and was more than a match for the normal run-of-the-mill hollywood blockbusters .
jeremy radcliffe , england it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold .
i think mainly because of kidman unfortunately - she was just too beautiful and clean to believable - perfect makeup at all times etc .
law was wonderful though .
christina , canada this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure rob , uk truly a sign of a good film when you do not realise how long you have been sitting in the cinema !
j , uk i saw it for the performance from jack white as georgia ... i did n't think much of the rest of it .
katey , uk i thought nicole kidman was great .
a stunning piece of work .
emily , uk a gripping epic ; difficult to watch at times due to gritty violent scenes .
the cinematography is very , very good .
renée zellweger is undoubtedly the star - she 's outstanding as ruby .
but what stops the film from being , in my opinion , a classic is the lack of a real romantic payoff for the central characters , ada and inman .
the penultimate scene was incredibly depressing and disappointing , leaving my overall impression of the film as - well , a downer .
wendy , uk this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure .
excellent performances all round , with nicole kidman 's unutterably expressive visage again proving that she 's one of the greatest actresses of her generation .
minghella has an amazing eye , coupling this with his skills as an " actors ' director " to create a wonderful piece of cinema .
rob , uk it is , quite frankly , one of the most astonishing examples of a time period being recreated on the screen .
i saw the film in the company of several friends who read the book -lrb- as i did -rrb- and share with me an abiding interest in the civil war era .
minghella did not strike a single false note .
truly magnificent .
robert del valle , usa superb central performances from law and kidman , beautifully photographed - an all round high quality production .
anthony minghella has served up another excellent and riveting film without resorting to lots of contrived dramatic action and explosions -lrb- well ok apart from the big mother at the start -rrb- .
a truly tender and moving yarn without a drop of the ususal hollywood sentimentality .
excellent antidote to love actually .
roberto , uk what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
richard sherlock , uk beautifully shot , and a very accessible film .
kudos to ray winstone and jude law for nailing their roles .
i thought nicole kidman 's accent slipped on occasion .
what was n't to enjoy ?
simon , uk / usa an average film .
the film would have benefited greatly from having the utterly pointless sex scenes remove - which would then have dropped it down a rating and opened it up to a wider audience .
the point of these scenes could have been put across just as powerfully if they were only drunk , but no films these days must have pointless sex and bare flesh on display regardless .
in addition , although most of the characterisation was well constructed , there was little chemistry between the law and kidman which only served to weaken the whole structure on which the story is based .
what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
unlike the book , there was no reference to the slaves working in cold mountain and the tension in the relationships .
it seems odd that this was completely dropped and yet the story kept within the civil war period .
finally , the ending was also very disappointing - should have kept the original .
if in doubt go with the author not a screenwriter who 's hacking a work about .
overall - not bad but could do a lot better .
rivchard sherlock , uk best film of 2003 .
wonderful cinematography , excellent performances and a beautifully paced film that enraptures from start to finish , greatly enjoyed by an audience that applauded loudly at the end .
that says it all .
congratulations to a wonderful cast and crew , especially anthony minghella and iain smith .
you guys deserve an oscar for this one .
joanna , long island , new york brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann bill cahuasa , uk a fine cast , some top class acting , but still a blatant oscar vehicle .
i hope -lrb- for the creditability of the oscars -rrb- that cold mountain does n't win best film .
chatts , uk a genuinely fantastic piece of film making .
the cinematography was phenomenal .
we need to get over this issue about some films being too long .
bottom line , you ca n't make a 300 page book into a 90 minute film without butchering it .
this story needed the time to draw us in and develop the charecters .
that is what gets mangella the casts that he does in all his films .
storytelling is not compromised .
brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann .
the central romance was brilliantly played out .
it is the fact that the two lovers are both going through their own individual hells and the hope of the other gives them the strength to continue and grow as people that gives the film its resonance .
bill cahusac , united kingdom i -lrb- mostly -rrb- disagree with the review .
yes , there was some judicious cutting , and renee zellweger 's accent took a little time to settle down , but i thought that the acting , especially by jude law and p s hoffman , was excellent .
the romance may have been a little uninspriring , with ada being not particularly lovable , but then i thought the romance in the english patient was too , with both main characters being thoroughly unpleasant .
it did n't mean the film itself was bad .
a good use of $ 9 and a couple of hours .
alice carter , usa two and a half hours of my life - wasted !
a poorly scripted and unbelievable waste of time - the only redeeming features being the photography and zellweger 's - deliberately ? - comic performance .
it sems to try to be both a romance and an action / adventure and fails at both - if the scripting had been moved more in one direction or the other then - with such a strong cast - it would have fared far better .
in trying to encapsulate both genres , i fear the director will turn off lovers of both .
roger stout , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical oscar material dan cross , uk i thought it was a beautiful well acted and shot film that moved me a few times to the point of tears and had me crossing my fingers at the end for jude law to survive .
i fantastic tribute to the book .
sarah nelson , england it was n't a happy film , but the production was very well done and the acting generally brilliant .
cold mountain reminded me of the english patient in some aspects .
lots of bad things happening to people in wars , nasty brutish local big man , sumptuous scenery and lots of oscar-worthy detail .
mike hawkes , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical " oscar material " .
for my part , i almost fell asleep twice trying to stay interested but the actor 's plight did n't come over and grab my attention at all .
dan cross , uk against the current crop of heavy action films cold mountain stands out as a wonderfully moving , beautifully filmed story of a tragic love story in it 's finest mould .
i loved it .
i did n't notice the time pass and while noticing the differences between novel and film i was still gripped and moved all the way through .
kate , uk it was a good moved ruined by nicole kidman , renee zellwegger was great in this movie but it was a bit long for me .
nicky , uk boy , was i disappointed in cold mountain .
the story line was too drawn out and non-believable .
the movie was drawn out .
the acting was all right .
actually , the one who stole the movie was renee zellwegger .
she was at least spunky .
hope the movie does not win any oscars .
rhonda , usa i was terribly disappointed with cold mountain .
i found myself wondering what else could possibly go wrong for these poor souls ... and found out in the end !
what a horrible movie !
only good things in it were renee zellweger and jude law .
brenda , canada jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable evelyn hong , england great film apart from poor nicole - pretty as she is i just do n't see how she gets cast in roles with deep passionate love at their centre .
where 's the chemistry ?
it looked like she filmed her bits separately from the rest of the cast -lrb- as is usual with her films -rrb- .
oh - and martin from the uk - the film was based on a book which was n't about the american civil war or slavery but about inman 's journey -lrb- undertones of homer 's odyssey -rrb- .
jane , london , england an overlong , worthy , competent , clearly miramax-funded film , with the obligatory ' character ' part for philip seymour hoffman .
a more cynically oscar-courting movie has not been seen for some time .
nicole is meant to be a destitute farmer , so why does it always look like mrs max factor has just slapped on some more powder ?
and in the closing scenes , i 'm sure she 's got tinted contacts in .
what utter contempt minghella must have for the audience .
rupert cousens , uk overblown , waffly , historically inaccurate , pretentious - so sugary i kept checking the state of my teeth .
fiona starkey-norman , uk the film was far too long .
stricter editing on the battle scenes would have made it much better .
there was too much violence and sex .
jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable .
overall it was a big disappointment for me seeing the film - i felt it was a waste of time .
evelyn hong , england inman 's journey home from the battlefield was slow , painful and seemed like it would never end : having watched cold mountain i know how he felt .
tedious and self indulgent .
andrew ferguson , scotland excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent dave golding , uk i found the film to be a very well put together story with an excellent story line .
all the actors were magnificent in their roles , ray winstone and donald sutherland were a treat to watch .
the length of the film only helped to show the tribulations faced by jude law on his mission homewards .
all things said and done , there is a place for films like this and we should be grateful that there are people who are still prepared to make them despite of the critics opinions .
john boyle , uk enjoyable in parts and a good story , but far too long and drawn out throughout .
martyn , uk i think the film works very well and rather than spoon feeding us the romance lets us take a leap of faith with the characters .
given that they have very little onscreen time together , i think both law and especially kidman quickly established their passion for each other which sustains them - and the film for its epic journey .
graham thomas , uk excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent .
dave golding , uk a great film with fine performances from jude law , nicole kidman and renee zellweger - and good work from donald sutherland , eileen atkins , philip seymour hoffman and charlie hunnam in their supporting roles .
the battle scene in the first 15 minutes makes grim but compelling viewing , and from there on , the film really takes hold of you .
andrew buckingham , london wonderful , aside from nicole kidman , who left me cold and thus ruined the main reason for the quest .
holly , uk the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery martin , uk i did n't enjoy the english patient and i thought cold mountain only a little better .
overlong , slow , it ai n't no gone with the wind .
i could n't care about the two leads and the outcome of their relationship .
the supporting cast were good though .
it is the sort of film that the academy awards loves , which is unfortunate for peter jackson as the return of the king was a masterpiece and should win best film and best director .
lynda burns , edinburgh , scotland on his return jude law did an excellent impression of clint eastwood , looking cool as can be in cowboy designer stubble in the comany of fine women and perfectly delivering one-liners .. have you been shot ?
" not lately " .
steve w , uk beautifully filmed and superbly cast .
an enjoyable story which is given the time to develop .
minghella won me over with this film , i found the english patient unbearably dull .

a very hard slog up a treacherous mountain is what i would compare sitting through this film to .
somewhat entertaining in a " i 've done it ! " kind of way .

dan rawlings , australia cold mountain - an absorbing and enjoyable film beautifully shot .
on the downside jude law was miscast as inman and it was difficult to warm to either of the two central characters -lrb- kidman and law -rrb- .

one of the worst films i 've seen in a long while .
utterly pointless , lacking inspiration , hammy acting , it had nothing save for a few excellent scenes from law and some smouldering from portman .
kidman wasted , zellweger irritating .
philip seymour hoffman was excellent but his character was completely pointless and should have been left out to get the misery down to under 2 hours .
dire .
and 2 1/2 hours long .
graham , uk in the civil war movie cold mountain nicole kidman has the looks , temperament and acting ability of the queen 's corgis dog .
she is now going to star in a movie remake of the television series bewitched as samantha .
samantha at times would chnage into a corgis dog so this is a fitting role for nicole kidman .
clory jane mostek , united states of america a really good film with beautiful snowy scenes and thought provoking civil war scenes .
renee provided the light relief with great witty lines and was my particular favourite .
jude law and all the supporting cast did a brilliant job , but sadly nicole was a bit flat .
even so , i recommend people go and see cold mountain .
janet bangs , uk why was n't this film shot in north carolina ?
duh !
we are the third largest film center in the u.s. , with all the technical support and amenities needed for film professionals , yet it was filmed , for the most part , in europe .
would 've been a real winner had it been filmed on native soil .
joan , raleigh , nc usa while good in parts the film can not get past a central problem - the romantic leads are so rarely seen together that the underlying romance is unbelievable .
add in zellwegger 's ham acting and kidman 's immaculate presentation -lrb- farm girl with perfect make-up ? -rrb- and this one fails to involve .
richard moore , uk i enjoyed the film very much .
the leads are captivating .
i was especially impressed by the production design , the rural mountain community and scenery which looks truly authentic to western north carolina , where i live .
frazier 's novel is a masterpiece in its own right and likewise minghella 's film , a real treat for us to see a story so close to home up there on the screen .
i wish much success for cold mountain come awards time .

michael edney , uk a finely crafted film with many excellent cast choices and performances , especially in the minor roles .
the attraction between ada and inman is very powerful , a subtle subtext in the book and the film does not fully capture that .
mike , uk i dont know what it is about minghella , but he seems to make otherwise good and sensual actors into wooden tops .
the english patient was cold and pretentious , but cold mountain was simply appalling .
how can all these good people giving all these good reviews have been taken in by such a truly awful film - the only saving grace -lrb- like in the english patient -rrb- was the scenery but if i had wanted to go to watch a travel film , i would have chosen to go . -lrb- oh - and renee zellwegger - what a relief she was -rrb- .
does the director instruct the love scenes by numbers - they look like it .
sorry fellow filmgoers , this appalling , insincere and pretentious film should not be up for any awards - but i felt the same for the english patient , and will never bother to give minghella the benefit of the doubt again .
sue , england your cold mountain reviewer is a bit harsh .
granted , the accents of some of the characters are irritating or unintentionally amusing as they keep slipping from southern american drawl into english , or mangled cockney in ray winstone 's case , but it 's still a beautifully shot , moving love story with great performances from kidman , law , hoffman and portman .
zellweger is outclassed and hams it up as a result , but you need some light relief in what is otherwise a very tragic story .
i 'm glad minghella has stayed true to the novel and kept the ending .
i thought kidman just slightly too old and wise for the role of ada but she was convincing all the same .
tammy , uk did matthew slater see the same film ?
this film blew me away !
hopefully cold mountain will clean up at the oscars and we can finally get over the bored of the rings hype .

director anthony minghella 's take on love in the desert produced the award-winning film the english patient .
this time , the backdrop for his epic love story is the remote hills of north carolina .
but it is hard to imagine cinema-goers warming to cold mountain .
minghella is aiming for a modern gone with the wind , but only manages a forrest gump with better acting and prettier scenery .
the film stars law and kidman as lovers uprooted by a war that changed a nation .
zellweger gives kidman a helping hand based on charles frazier 's award-winning novel , law plays wp inman , a hero in the best tradition of strong , silent types .
kidman is ada monroe , the very picture of old southern manners .
ada arrives on the scene when her preacher father -lrb- donald sutherland -rrb- leaves charleston for the more pastoral pleasures of cold mountain .
she meets inman and two or three clunkily-scripted scenes later we have a backwoods version of scarlett o 'hara and ashley wilkes .
but all is not what it seems in the garden of eden .
war is around the corner and the rather useless ada is also being romantically pursued by ray winstone 's bearded beast , teague .
inman begins a ulysses-like trek home and the journey , like the film , is long and arduous .
law -lrb- pictured -rrb- and kidman spend little screen time together it is not without incident , however , with plenty of portentous sentiment and some very good acting .
inman encounters a who 's who of hollywood talent - philip seymour hoffman , giovanni ribisi and natalie portman - who all either help , hinder or tempt our hero from his righteous path back to the woman he loves .
meanwhile , an over-acting but green-fingered renee zellweger arrives to help ada out on the farm .
but as good as parts of this film are - the battle scenes , the law and portman vignette , seymour hoffman 's frisky clergyman - cold mountain can not overcome the problems of its central uninspiring romance .
minghella 's previous oscars triumph , the english patient may not have suited all tastes , but at least the passion between its stars ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas was believable .
cold mountain is out now in the uk - the views page is now closed but please see below for a selection of your comments .
a beautiful piece of film making , david lean is alive and well and trapped inside mingella 's head .
the scenery alone is worth the ticket price , but then you add in fine performances , a well written script , and some stunning camera work and effects .
this film is so refreshingly grown-up .
alice thomas , uk beautiful scenery , some excellent acting -lrb- although i felt zellwegger was irritatingly caricaturing her role -rrb- , and some great scenes that really had me hooked .
but , by the time the film ended , the whole context and backdrop of the film , i.e. the civil war , seemed to have disappeared into insignificance , and i was left wondering what point the film had made .
for me , it had failed to make one .
claire , london , uk it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold christina , canada cold mountain is one of those films where the whole is somehow less than the sum of the parts .
had this not been so then it would have been absolutely magnificent !
thus it does n't quite hit the peaks of minghella 's others -lrb- patient / ripley -rrb- but at the same time it 's a very decent cinematic experience and full marks to him and the miramax team for undertaking it .
the fact that i 'm still turning it over means that it has left a strong impression whatever its minor shortcomings .
john coope , uk about 20 minutes too long -lrb- could have shaved off the gratuitous sex-scene -rrb- , but good performances from all -lrb- although the decision to change zellweger 's ruby from a cherokee but not the dialogue expressed by , or to , her , was a strange one -rrb- .
even on the big screen not as visually captivating as it could have been ; it had no scale , to me , and seemed ' small ' .
enjoyable enough .
alex hornby , uk a bit long although i thought the acting was generally good .
the most jarring problems for me , being from the southern us , were the accents .
jude law 's was impeccable but nicole kidman , ray winstone and philip seymour hoffman had some serious slips with their accent work .
rachel , usa an exceptional piece of entertainment .
followed the book well and was more than a match for the normal run-of-the-mill hollywood blockbusters .
jeremy radcliffe , england it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold .
i think mainly because of kidman unfortunately - she was just too beautiful and clean to believable - perfect makeup at all times etc .
law was wonderful though .
christina , canada this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure rob , uk truly a sign of a good film when you do not realise how long you have been sitting in the cinema !
j , uk i saw it for the performance from jack white as georgia ... i did n't think much of the rest of it .
katey , uk i thought nicole kidman was great .
a stunning piece of work .
emily , uk a gripping epic ; difficult to watch at times due to gritty violent scenes .
the cinematography is very , very good .
renée zellweger is undoubtedly the star - she 's outstanding as ruby .
but what stops the film from being , in my opinion , a classic is the lack of a real romantic payoff for the central characters , ada and inman .
the penultimate scene was incredibly depressing and disappointing , leaving my overall impression of the film as - well , a downer .
wendy , uk this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure .
excellent performances all round , with nicole kidman 's unutterably expressive visage again proving that she 's one of the greatest actresses of her generation .
minghella has an amazing eye , coupling this with his skills as an " actors ' director " to create a wonderful piece of cinema .
rob , uk it is , quite frankly , one of the most astonishing examples of a time period being recreated on the screen .
i saw the film in the company of several friends who read the book -lrb- as i did -rrb- and share with me an abiding interest in the civil war era .
minghella did not strike a single false note .
truly magnificent .
robert del valle , usa superb central performances from law and kidman , beautifully photographed - an all round high quality production .
anthony minghella has served up another excellent and riveting film without resorting to lots of contrived dramatic action and explosions -lrb- well ok apart from the big mother at the start -rrb- .
a truly tender and moving yarn without a drop of the ususal hollywood sentimentality .
excellent antidote to love actually .
roberto , uk what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
richard sherlock , uk beautifully shot , and a very accessible film .
kudos to ray winstone and jude law for nailing their roles .
i thought nicole kidman 's accent slipped on occasion .
what was n't to enjoy ?
simon , uk / usa an average film .
the film would have benefited greatly from having the utterly pointless sex scenes remove - which would then have dropped it down a rating and opened it up to a wider audience .
the point of these scenes could have been put across just as powerfully if they were only drunk , but no films these days must have pointless sex and bare flesh on display regardless .
in addition , although most of the characterisation was well constructed , there was little chemistry between the law and kidman which only served to weaken the whole structure on which the story is based .
what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
unlike the book , there was no reference to the slaves working in cold mountain and the tension in the relationships .
it seems odd that this was completely dropped and yet the story kept within the civil war period .
finally , the ending was also very disappointing - should have kept the original .
if in doubt go with the author not a screenwriter who 's hacking a work about .
overall - not bad but could do a lot better .
rivchard sherlock , uk best film of 2003 .
wonderful cinematography , excellent performances and a beautifully paced film that enraptures from start to finish , greatly enjoyed by an audience that applauded loudly at the end .
that says it all .
congratulations to a wonderful cast and crew , especially anthony minghella and iain smith .
you guys deserve an oscar for this one .
joanna , long island , new york brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann bill cahuasa , uk a fine cast , some top class acting , but still a blatant oscar vehicle .
i hope -lrb- for the creditability of the oscars -rrb- that cold mountain does n't win best film .
chatts , uk a genuinely fantastic piece of film making .
the cinematography was phenomenal .
we need to get over this issue about some films being too long .
bottom line , you ca n't make a 300 page book into a 90 minute film without butchering it .
this story needed the time to draw us in and develop the charecters .
that is what gets mangella the casts that he does in all his films .
storytelling is not compromised .
brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann .
the central romance was brilliantly played out .
it is the fact that the two lovers are both going through their own individual hells and the hope of the other gives them the strength to continue and grow as people that gives the film its resonance .
bill cahusac , united kingdom i -lrb- mostly -rrb- disagree with the review .
yes , there was some judicious cutting , and renee zellweger 's accent took a little time to settle down , but i thought that the acting , especially by jude law and p s hoffman , was excellent .
the romance may have been a little uninspriring , with ada being not particularly lovable , but then i thought the romance in the english patient was too , with both main characters being thoroughly unpleasant .
it did n't mean the film itself was bad .
a good use of $ 9 and a couple of hours .
alice carter , usa two and a half hours of my life - wasted !
a poorly scripted and unbelievable waste of time - the only redeeming features being the photography and zellweger 's - deliberately ? - comic performance .
it sems to try to be both a romance and an action / adventure and fails at both - if the scripting had been moved more in one direction or the other then - with such a strong cast - it would have fared far better .
in trying to encapsulate both genres , i fear the director will turn off lovers of both .
roger stout , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical oscar material dan cross , uk i thought it was a beautiful well acted and shot film that moved me a few times to the point of tears and had me crossing my fingers at the end for jude law to survive .
i fantastic tribute to the book .
sarah nelson , england it was n't a happy film , but the production was very well done and the acting generally brilliant .
cold mountain reminded me of the english patient in some aspects .
lots of bad things happening to people in wars , nasty brutish local big man , sumptuous scenery and lots of oscar-worthy detail .
mike hawkes , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical " oscar material " .
for my part , i almost fell asleep twice trying to stay interested but the actor 's plight did n't come over and grab my attention at all .
dan cross , uk against the current crop of heavy action films cold mountain stands out as a wonderfully moving , beautifully filmed story of a tragic love story in it 's finest mould .
i loved it .
i did n't notice the time pass and while noticing the differences between novel and film i was still gripped and moved all the way through .
kate , uk it was a good moved ruined by nicole kidman , renee zellwegger was great in this movie but it was a bit long for me .
nicky , uk boy , was i disappointed in cold mountain .
the story line was too drawn out and non-believable .
the movie was drawn out .
the acting was all right .
actually , the one who stole the movie was renee zellwegger .
she was at least spunky .
hope the movie does not win any oscars .
rhonda , usa i was terribly disappointed with cold mountain .
i found myself wondering what else could possibly go wrong for these poor souls ... and found out in the end !
what a horrible movie !
only good things in it were renee zellweger and jude law .
brenda , canada jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable evelyn hong , england great film apart from poor nicole - pretty as she is i just do n't see how she gets cast in roles with deep passionate love at their centre .
where 's the chemistry ?
it looked like she filmed her bits separately from the rest of the cast -lrb- as is usual with her films -rrb- .
oh - and martin from the uk - the film was based on a book which was n't about the american civil war or slavery but about inman 's journey -lrb- undertones of homer 's odyssey -rrb- .
jane , london , england an overlong , worthy , competent , clearly miramax-funded film , with the obligatory ' character ' part for philip seymour hoffman .
a more cynically oscar-courting movie has not been seen for some time .
nicole is meant to be a destitute farmer , so why does it always look like mrs max factor has just slapped on some more powder ?
and in the closing scenes , i 'm sure she 's got tinted contacts in .
what utter contempt minghella must have for the audience .
rupert cousens , uk overblown , waffly , historically inaccurate , pretentious - so sugary i kept checking the state of my teeth .
fiona starkey-norman , uk the film was far too long .
stricter editing on the battle scenes would have made it much better .
there was too much violence and sex .
jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable .
overall it was a big disappointment for me seeing the film - i felt it was a waste of time .
evelyn hong , england inman 's journey home from the battlefield was slow , painful and seemed like it would never end : having watched cold mountain i know how he felt .
tedious and self indulgent .
andrew ferguson , scotland excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent dave golding , uk i found the film to be a very well put together story with an excellent story line .
all the actors were magnificent in their roles , ray winstone and donald sutherland were a treat to watch .
the length of the film only helped to show the tribulations faced by jude law on his mission homewards .
all things said and done , there is a place for films like this and we should be grateful that there are people who are still prepared to make them despite of the critics opinions .
john boyle , uk enjoyable in parts and a good story , but far too long and drawn out throughout .
martyn , uk i think the film works very well and rather than spoon feeding us the romance lets us take a leap of faith with the characters .
given that they have very little onscreen time together , i think both law and especially kidman quickly established their passion for each other which sustains them - and the film for its epic journey .
graham thomas , uk excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent .
dave golding , uk a great film with fine performances from jude law , nicole kidman and renee zellweger - and good work from donald sutherland , eileen atkins , philip seymour hoffman and charlie hunnam in their supporting roles .
the battle scene in the first 15 minutes makes grim but compelling viewing , and from there on , the film really takes hold of you .
andrew buckingham , london wonderful , aside from nicole kidman , who left me cold and thus ruined the main reason for the quest .
holly , uk the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery martin , uk i did n't enjoy the english patient and i thought cold mountain only a little better .
overlong , slow , it ai n't no gone with the wind .
i could n't care about the two leads and the outcome of their relationship .
the supporting cast were good though .
it is the sort of film that the academy awards loves , which is unfortunate for peter jackson as the return of the king was a masterpiece and should win best film and best director .
lynda burns , edinburgh , scotland on his return jude law did an excellent impression of clint eastwood , looking cool as can be in cowboy designer stubble in the comany of fine women and perfectly delivering one-liners .. have you been shot ?
" not lately " .
steve w , uk beautifully filmed and superbly cast .
an enjoyable story which is given the time to develop .
minghella won me over with this film , i found the english patient unbearably dull .
steve , england brilliant , gorgeous - what over-acting from zellweger ? ? ? ? ? ?
some reviewers over-analyse everything ! ! ! !
martin garvey , uk cold mountain is another example of meaningless film-making - the characters are not rooted in historical reality .
the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery .
martin , uk sort of deliverance with war but really worth the watching at a cinema as its a very ' big ' film .
i thought it was better than the english patient and the romance restrained which was nice for a change !
jude law is gorgeous too .
trina , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was absolutely wonderful .
i read the book over 4 years ago and it lived up to all my expectations .
i laughed and sobbed through most of the movie and thought about it for days afterwards .
the acting was first class although i did notice southern accents occasionally slipping -lrb- yes , you ray winstone ! -rrb- but i do n't think any of the actors were from the deep south so i forgive them .
all in all totally tops ! ! ! ! !
emma , usa -lrb- originally uk -rrb- phew ! !
a very hard slog up a treacherous mountain is what i would compare sitting through this film to .
somewhat entertaining in a " i 've done it ! " kind of way .
thank god for renee zellwegger 's arrival half way through to save us from the ever pouting , eternally well-dressed nicole kidman .
dan rawlings , australia cold mountain - an absorbing and enjoyable film beautifully shot .
on the downside jude law was miscast as inman and it was difficult to warm to either of the two central characters -lrb- kidman and law -rrb- .
a missed opportunity in some respects mr minghella !
dave , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing .
mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was exceptional piece of filmmaking .
true , it did require patience but i was blown away by the performances of all the main cast particularly jude law , it was beautifuly shot and acted and i found it genuinely moving .
richard , ireland an excellent adventure .
kim howe , uk renee zellweger gives a funny performance and steals every scene she is in - she deserves the oscar buzz for best supporting actress .
otherwise , i agree with the bbc reviewer , the movie is fairly uninspiring .
andrea , canada i believe someone should ask charles frazier what he thinks of the film of his novel .
i think he would be horrified .
it is amazing how long the film is when you consider how much has been cut from the book .
hardly any of the beauty and depth of the novel survives the transition to the screen .
the decision to grow the teague character to accommodate the slender talents of ray winstone is a mistake .
much of the script as a whole is indeed clunky , no mean feat when the language of the novel is light and precise .
it is as if anthony minghella was jealous of the creativity and richness of the novel and has deliberately set out to jettison them .
a huge disappointment .
alan brown , england just as boring as the english patient , but without the pay-off of a big lead dying .
caroline , uk as mentioned - it was english patient meets gone with the wind .
long , with an abundance of triteness but still containing some memorable scenes and acting performances .
what was interesting is how nicole kidman 's character could be starving and freezing and yet have such a perfect complexion , clean hands and manage to keep all but four strands of hair in place .
what an amazing woman .
fred roboz , usa it takes a while to get over jude law and ray winstone putting on american accents , but once you do it 's well worth it .
some very moving moments .
george cockerill , uk utterly terrible .
one of the worst films i 've seen in a long while .
utterly pointless , lacking inspiration , hammy acting , it had nothing save for a few excellent scenes from law and some smouldering from portman .
kidman wasted , zellweger irritating .
philip seymour hoffman was excellent but his character was completely pointless and should have been left out to get the misery down to under 2 hours .
dire .
and 2 1/2 hours long .
graham , uk in the civil war movie cold mountain nicole kidman has the looks , temperament and acting ability of the queen 's corgis dog .
she is now going to star in a movie remake of the television series bewitched as samantha .
samantha at times would chnage into a corgis dog so this is a fitting role for nicole kidman .
clory jane mostek , united states of america a really good film with beautiful snowy scenes and thought provoking civil war scenes .
renee provided the light relief with great witty lines and was my particular favourite .
jude law and all the supporting cast did a brilliant job , but sadly nicole was a bit flat .
even so , i recommend people go and see cold mountain .
janet bangs , uk why was n't this film shot in north carolina ?

director anthony minghella 's take on love in the desert produced the award-winning film the english patient .
this time , the backdrop for his epic love story is the remote hills of north carolina .
but it is hard to imagine cinema-goers warming to cold mountain .
minghella is aiming for a modern gone with the wind , but only manages a forrest gump with better acting and prettier scenery .
the film stars law and kidman as lovers uprooted by a war that changed a nation .
based on charles frazier 's award-winning novel , law plays wp inman , a hero in the best tradition of strong , silent types .
kidman is ada monroe , the very picture of old southern manners .
ada arrives on the scene when her preacher father -lrb- donald sutherland -rrb- leaves charleston for the more pastoral pleasures of cold mountain .
she meets inman and two or three clunkily-scripted scenes later we have a backwoods version of scarlett o 'hara and ashley wilkes .
but all is not what it seems in the garden of eden .
war is around the corner and the rather useless ada is also being romantically pursued by ray winstone 's bearded beast , teague .
inman begins a ulysses-like trek home and the journey , like the film , is long and arduous .
it is not without incident , however , with plenty of portentous sentiment and some very good acting .
inman encounters a who 's who of hollywood talent - philip seymour hoffman , giovanni ribisi and natalie portman - who all either help , hinder or tempt our hero from his righteous path back to the woman he loves .
meanwhile , an over-acting but green-fingered renee zellweger arrives to help ada out on the farm .
but as good as parts of this film are - the battle scenes , the law and portman vignette , seymour hoffman 's frisky clergyman - cold mountain can not overcome the problems of its central uninspiring romance .
minghella 's previous oscars triumph , the english patient may not have suited all tastes , but at least the passion between its stars ralph fiennes and kristin scott thomas was believable .
cold mountain is out now in the uk - the views page is now closed but please see below for a selection of your comments .
a beautiful piece of film making , david lean is alive and well and trapped inside mingella 's head .
the scenery alone is worth the ticket price , but then you add in fine performances , a well written script , and some stunning camera work and effects .
this film is so refreshingly grown-up .
alice thomas , uk beautiful scenery , some excellent acting -lrb- although i felt zellwegger was irritatingly caricaturing her role -rrb- , and some great scenes that really had me hooked .
but , by the time the film ended , the whole context and backdrop of the film , i.e. the civil war , seemed to have disappeared into insignificance , and i was left wondering what point the film had made .
for me , it had failed to make one .
claire , london , uk " it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold " christina , canada cold mountain is one of those films where the whole is somehow less than the sum of the parts .
had this not been so then it would have been absolutely magnificent !
thus it does n't quite hit the peaks of minghella 's others -lrb- patient / ripley -rrb- but at the same time it 's a very decent cinematic experience and full marks to him and the miramax team for undertaking it .
the fact that i 'm still turning it over means that it has left a strong impression whatever its minor shortcomings .
john coope , uk about 20 minutes too long -lrb- could have shaved off the gratuitous sex-scene -rrb- , but good performances from all -lrb- although the decision to change zellweger 's ruby from a cherokee but not the dialogue expressed by , or to , her , was a strange one -rrb- .
even on the big screen not as visually captivating as it could have been ; it had no scale , to me , and seemed ' small ' .
enjoyable enough .
alex hornby , uk a bit long although i thought the acting was generally good .
the most jarring problems for me , being from the southern us , were the accents .
jude law 's was impeccable but nicole kidman , ray winstone and philip seymour hoffman had some serious slips with their accent work .
rachel , usa an exceptional piece of entertainment .
followed the book well and was more than a match for the normal run-of-the-mill hollywood blockbusters .
jeremy radcliffe , england it had all the pieces to be wonderful , but i was left cold .
i think mainly because of kidman unfortunately - she was just too beautiful and clean to believable - perfect makeup at all times etc .
law was wonderful though .
christina , canada " this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure " rob , uk truly a sign of a good film when you do not realise how long you have been sitting in the cinema !
j , uk i saw it for the performance from jack white as georgia ... i did n't think much of the rest of it .
katey , uk i thought nicole kidman was great .
a stunning piece of work .
emily , uk a gripping epic ; difficult to watch at times due to gritty violent scenes .
the cinematography is very , very good .
renée zellweger is undoubtedly the star - she 's outstanding as ruby .
but what stops the film from being , in my opinion , a classic is the lack of a real romantic payoff for the central characters , ada and inman .
the penultimate scene was incredibly depressing and disappointing , leaving my overall impression of the film as - well , a downer .
wendy , uk this was a truly beautiful film , shot through with tenderness and horror in equal measure .
excellent performances all round , with nicole kidman 's unutterably expressive visage again proving that she 's one of the greatest actresses of her generation .
minghella has an amazing eye , coupling this with his skills as an " actors ' director " to create a wonderful piece of cinema .
rob , uk it is , quite frankly , one of the most astonishing examples of a time period being recreated on the screen .
i saw the film in the company of several friends who read the book -lrb- as i did -rrb- and share with me an abiding interest in the civil war era .
minghella did not strike a single false note .
truly magnificent .
robert del valle , usa superb central performances from law and kidman , beautifully photographed - an all round high quality production .
anthony minghella has served up another excellent and riveting film without resorting to lots of contrived dramatic action and explosions -lrb- well ok apart from the big mother at the start -rrb- .
a truly tender and moving yarn without a drop of the ususal hollywood sentimentality .
excellent antidote to love actually .
roberto , uk " what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ? "
richard sherlock , uk beautifully shot , and a very accessible film .
kudos to ray winstone and jude law for nailing their roles .
i thought nicole kidman 's accent slipped on occasion .
what was n't to enjoy ?
simon , uk / usa an average film .
the film would have benefited greatly from having the utterly pointless sex scenes remove - which would then have dropped it down a rating and opened it up to a wider audience .
the point of these scenes could have been put across just as powerfully if they were only drunk , but no films these days must have pointless sex and bare flesh on display regardless .
in addition , although most of the characterisation was well constructed , there was little chemistry between the law and kidman which only served to weaken the whole structure on which the story is based .
what happened to the historical background and reasons for the war in the first place ?
unlike the book , there was no reference to the slaves working in cold mountain and the tension in the relationships .
it seems odd that this was completely dropped and yet the story kept within the civil war period .
finally , the ending was also very disappointing - should have kept the original .
if in doubt go with the author not a screenwriter who 's hacking a work about .
overall - not bad but could do a lot better .
rivchard sherlock , uk best film of 2003 .
wonderful cinematography , excellent performances and a beautifully paced film that enraptures from start to finish , greatly enjoyed by an audience that applauded loudly at the end .
that says it all .
congratulations to a wonderful cast and crew , especially anthony minghella and iain smith .
you guys deserve an oscar for this one .
joanna , long island , new york " brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann " bill cahuasa , uk a fine cast , some top class acting , but still a blatant oscar vehicle .
i hope -lrb- for the creditability of the oscars -rrb- that cold mountain does n't win best film .
chatts , uk a genuinely fantastic piece of film making .
the cinematography was phenomenal .
we need to get over this issue about some films being too long .
bottom line , you ca n't make a 300 page book into a 90 minute film without butchering it .
this story needed the time to draw us in and develop the charecters .
that is what gets mangella the casts that he does in all his films .
storytelling is not compromised .
brilliant leading charecters that i cared about along with excellent supporting performances , particularly from ray winstone and philip seymour hoffmann .
the central romance was brilliantly played out .
it is the fact that the two lovers are both going through their own individual hells and the hope of the other gives them the strength to continue and grow as people that gives the film its resonance .
bill cahusac , united kingdom i -lrb- mostly -rrb- disagree with the review .
yes , there was some judicious cutting , and renee zellweger 's accent took a little time to settle down , but i thought that the acting , especially by jude law and p s hoffman , was excellent .
the romance may have been a little uninspriring , with ada being not particularly lovable , but then i thought the romance in the english patient was too , with both main characters being thoroughly unpleasant .
it did n't mean the film itself was bad .
a good use of $ 9 and a couple of hours .
alice carter , usa two and a half hours of my life - wasted !
a poorly scripted and unbelievable waste of time - the only redeeming features being the photography and zellweger 's - deliberately ? - comic performance .
it sems to try to be both a romance and an action / adventure and fails at both - if the scripting had been moved more in one direction or the other then - with such a strong cast - it would have fared far better .
in trying to encapsulate both genres , i fear the director will turn off lovers of both .
roger stout , uk " what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical oscar material " dan cross , uk i thought it was a beautiful well acted and shot film that moved me a few times to the point of tears and had me crossing my fingers at the end for jude law to survive .
i fantastic tribute to the book .
sarah nelson , england it was n't a happy film , but the production was very well done and the acting generally brilliant .
cold mountain reminded me of the english patient in some aspects .
lots of bad things happening to people in wars , nasty brutish local big man , sumptuous scenery and lots of oscar-worthy detail .
mike hawkes , uk what complete and utter drivel !
i am surprised that anyone actually liked this film ... acting was patchy and woolly , and very predictable .
very typical " oscar material " .
for my part , i almost fell asleep twice trying to stay interested but the actor 's plight did n't come over and grab my attention at all .
dan cross , uk against the current crop of heavy action films cold mountain stands out as a wonderfully moving , beautifully filmed story of a tragic love story in it 's finest mould .
i loved it .
i did n't notice the time pass and while noticing the differences between novel and film i was still gripped and moved all the way through .
kate , uk it was a good moved ruined by nicole kidman , renee zellwegger was great in this movie but it was a bit long for me .
nicky , uk boy , was i disappointed in cold mountain .
the story line was too drawn out and non-believable .
the movie was drawn out .
the acting was all right .
actually , the one who stole the movie was renee zellwegger .
she was at least spunky .
hope the movie does not win any oscars .
rhonda , usa i was terribly disappointed with cold mountain .
i found myself wondering what else could possibly go wrong for these poor souls ... and found out in the end !
what a horrible movie !
only good things in it were renee zellweger and jude law .
brenda , canada " jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable " evelyn hong , england great film apart from poor nicole - pretty as she is i just do n't see how she gets cast in roles with deep passionate love at their centre .
where 's the chemistry ?
it looked like she filmed her bits separately from the rest of the cast -lrb- as is usual with her films -rrb- .
oh - and martin from the uk - the film was based on a book which was n't about the american civil war or slavery but about inman 's journey -lrb- undertones of homer 's odyssey -rrb- .
jane , london , england an overlong , worthy , competent , clearly miramax-funded film , with the obligatory ' character ' part for philip seymour hoffman .
a more cynically oscar-courting movie has not been seen for some time .
nicole is meant to be a destitute farmer , so why does it always look like mrs max factor has just slapped on some more powder ?
and in the closing scenes , i 'm sure she 's got tinted contacts in .
what utter contempt minghella must have for the audience .
rupert cousens , uk overblown , waffly , historically inaccurate , pretentious - so sugary i kept checking the state of my teeth .
fiona starkey-norman , uk the film was far too long .
stricter editing on the battle scenes would have made it much better .
there was too much violence and sex .
jude law acted his part well but the romance between himself and nicole kidman was n't believable .
overall it was a big disappointment for me seeing the film - i felt it was a waste of time .
evelyn hong , england inman 's journey home from the battlefield was slow , painful and seemed like it would never end : having watched cold mountain i know how he felt .
tedious and self indulgent .
andrew ferguson , scotland " excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent " dave golding , uk i found the film to be a very well put together story with an excellent story line .
all the actors were magnificent in their roles , ray winstone and donald sutherland were a treat to watch .
the length of the film only helped to show the tribulations faced by jude law on his mission homewards .
all things said and done , there is a place for films like this and we should be grateful that there are people who are still prepared to make them despite of the critics opinions .
john boyle , uk enjoyable in parts and a good story , but far too long and drawn out throughout .
martyn , uk i think the film works very well and rather than spoon feeding us the romance lets us take a leap of faith with the characters .
given that they have very little onscreen time together , i think both law and especially kidman quickly established their passion for each other which sustains them - and the film for its epic journey .
graham thomas , uk excellent film , beautifully acted , could have been 30 minutes shorter .
law , kidman and zellweger are all excellent .
dave golding , uk a great film with fine performances from jude law , nicole kidman and renee zellweger - and good work from donald sutherland , eileen atkins , philip seymour hoffman and charlie hunnam in their supporting roles .
the battle scene in the first 15 minutes makes grim but compelling viewing , and from there on , the film really takes hold of you .
andrew buckingham , london wonderful , aside from nicole kidman , who left me cold and thus ruined the main reason for the quest .
holly , uk " the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery " martin , uk i did n't enjoy the english patient and i thought cold mountain only a little better .
overlong , slow , it ai n't no gone with the wind .
i could n't care about the two leads and the outcome of their relationship .
the supporting cast were good though .
it is the sort of film that the academy awards loves , which is unfortunate for peter jackson as the return of the king was a masterpiece and should win best film and best director .
lynda burns , edinburgh , scotland on his return jude law did an excellent impression of clint eastwood , looking cool as can be in cowboy designer stubble in the comany of fine women and perfectly delivering one-liners .. have you been shot ?
" not lately " .
steve w , uk beautifully filmed and superbly cast .
an enjoyable story which is given the time to develop .
minghella won me over with this film , i found the english patient unbearably dull .
steve , england brilliant , gorgeous - what over-acting from zellweger ? ? ? ? ? ?
some reviewers over-analyse everything ! ! ! !
martin garvey , uk cold mountain is another example of meaningless film-making - the characters are not rooted in historical reality .
the film is set during the american civil war yet none of the characters discuss the issue that tore america apart - slavery .
martin , uk sort of deliverance with war but really worth the watching at a cinema as its a very ' big ' film .
i thought it was better than the english patient and the romance restrained which was nice for a change !
jude law is gorgeous too .
trina , uk " i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing " mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was absolutely wonderful .
i read the book over 4 years ago and it lived up to all my expectations .
i laughed and sobbed through most of the movie and thought about it for days afterwards .
the acting was first class although i did notice southern accents occasionally slipping -lrb- yes , you ray winstone ! -rrb- but i do n't think any of the actors were from the deep south so i forgive them .
all in all totally tops ! ! ! ! !
emma , usa -lrb- originally uk -rrb- phew ! !
a very hard slog up a treacherous mountain is what i would compare sitting through this film to .
somewhat entertaining in a " i 've done it ! " kind of way .
thank god for renee zellwegger 's arrival half way through to save us from the ever pouting , eternally well-dressed nicole kidman .
dan rawlings , australia cold mountain - an absorbing and enjoyable film beautifully shot .
on the downside jude law was miscast as inman and it was difficult to warm to either of the two central characters -lrb- kidman and law -rrb- .
a missed opportunity in some respects mr minghella !
dave , uk i thought cold mountain was truly amazing .
it showed what the war was really like , having to encounter the many dangers of returning home .
amazing .
mimi edwards , uk i thought cold mountain was exceptional piece of filmmaking .
true , it did require patience but i was blown away by the performances of all the main cast particularly jude law , it was beautifuly shot and acted and i found it genuinely moving .
richard , ireland an excellent adventure .
kim howe , uk renee zellweger gives a funny performance and steals every scene she is in - she deserves the oscar buzz for best supporting actress .
otherwise , i agree with the bbc reviewer , the movie is fairly uninspiring .
andrea , canada i believe someone should ask charles frazier what he thinks of the film of his novel .
i think he would be horrified .
it is amazing how long the film is when you consider how much has been cut from the book .
hardly any of the beauty and depth of the novel survives the transition to the screen .
the decision to grow the teague character to accommodate the slender talents of ray winstone is a mistake .
much of the script as a whole is indeed clunky , no mean feat when the language of the novel is light and precise .
it is as if anthony minghella was jealous of the creativity and richness of the novel and has deliberately set out to jettison them .
a huge disappointment .
alan brown , england just as boring as the english patient , but without the pay-off of a big lead dying .
caroline , uk as mentioned - it was english patient meets gone with the wind .
long , with an abundance of triteness but still containing some memorable scenes and acting performances .
what was interesting is how nicole kidman 's character could be starving and freezing and yet have such a perfect complexion , clean hands and manage to keep all but four strands of hair in place .
what an amazing woman .
fred roboz , usa it takes a while to get over jude law and ray winstone putting on american accents , but once you do it 's well worth it .
some very moving moments .
george cockerill , uk utterly terrible .
one of the worst films i 've seen in a long while .
utterly pointless , lacking inspiration , hammy acting , it had nothing save for a few excellent scenes from law and some smouldering from portman .
kidman wasted , zellweger irritating .
philip seymour hoffman was excellent but his character was completely pointless and should have been left out to get the misery down to under 2 hours .
dire .
and 2 1/2 hours long .
graham , uk in the civil war movie cold mountain nicole kidman has the looks , temperament and acting ability of the queen 's corgis dog .
she is now going to star in a movie remake of the television series bewitched as samantha .
samantha at times would chnage into a corgis dog so this is a fitting role for nicole kidman .
clory jane mostek , united states of america a really good film with beautiful snowy scenes and thought provoking civil war scenes .
renee provided the light relief with great witty lines and was my particular favourite .
jude law and all the supporting cast did a brilliant job , but sadly nicole was a bit flat .
even so , i recommend people go and see cold mountain .
janet bangs , uk why was n't this film shot in north carolina ?
duh !
we are the third largest film center in the u.s. , with all the technical support and amenities needed for film professionals , yet it was filmed , for the most part , in europe .
would 've been a real winner had it been filmed on native soil .
joan , raleigh , nc usa while good in parts the film can not get past a central problem - the romantic leads are so rarely seen together that the underlying romance is unbelievable .
add in zellwegger 's ham acting and kidman 's immaculate presentation -lrb- farm girl with perfect make-up ? -rrb- and this one fails to involve .
richard moore , uk i enjoyed the film very much .
the leads are captivating .
i was especially impressed by the production design , the rural mountain community and scenery which looks truly authentic to western north carolina , where i live .
frazier 's novel is a masterpiece in its own right and likewise minghella 's film , a real treat for us to see a story so close to home up there on the screen .
i wish much success for cold mountain come awards time .
lara , usa one of the most beautiful stories you will ever see on film .
the acting was superb , especially rene zellweiger .
despair , tragedy , beauty , love , and hope .
michael fox , usa bored , bored , bored - finally gave in and walked out before the end , painfully bored .
michael edney , uk a finely crafted film with many excellent cast choices and performances , especially in the minor roles .
the attraction between ada and inman is very powerful , a subtle subtext in the book and the film does not fully capture that .
mike , uk i dont know what it is about minghella , but he seems to make otherwise good and sensual actors into wooden tops .
the english patient was cold and pretentious , but cold mountain was simply appalling .
how can all these good people giving all these good reviews have been taken in by such a truly awful film - the only saving grace -lrb- like in the english patient -rrb- was the scenery but if i had wanted to go to watch a travel film , i would have chosen to go . -lrb- oh - and renee zellwegger - what a relief she was -rrb- .
does the director instruct the love scenes by numbers - they look like it .
sorry fellow filmgoers , this appalling , insincere and pretentious film should not be up for any awards - but i felt the same for the english patient , and will never bother to give minghella the benefit of the doubt again .
sue , england your cold mountain reviewer is a bit harsh .
granted , the accents of some of the characters are irritating or unintentionally amusing as they keep slipping from southern american drawl into english , or mangled cockney in ray winstone 's case , but it 's still a beautifully shot , moving love story with great performances from kidman , law , hoffman and portman .
zellweger is outclassed and hams it up as a result , but you need some light relief in what is otherwise a very tragic story .
i 'm glad minghella has stayed true to the novel and kept the ending .
i thought kidman just slightly too old and wise for the role of ada but she was convincing all the same .
tammy , uk did matthew slater see the same film ?
this film blew me away !
hopefully cold mountain will clean up at the oscars and we can finally get over the bored of the rings hype .

the conference on saturday will be the first since the defection in november of one of the party 's best known figures , alessandra mussolini .
ms mussolini , granddaughter of italy 's former fascist dictator , left after mr fini called fascism an " absolute evil " .
the national alliance is the second largest party in italy 's four-party coalition government .
fini and mussolini are now rivals it was founded in 1995 , following a split in what was then called the italian social movement , itself built on the ashes of benito mussolini 's fascist movement .
as late as 1994 , mr fini had described mussolini as the " greatest statesman of the 20th century " .
nevertheless , mr fini has been trying to move his party away from its fascist past into the respectable centre-right .
conventional right-left distinctions do not always apply in italy .
regional loyalties matter too - as do people 's own personal and family histories .
alessandra mussolini , a former topless model , is the niece of the film star sophia loren and daughter of benito mussolini 's jazz musician son , romano .
as a politician , she has frequently campaigned on such traditionally " left-wing " issues as women 's rights .
although the national alliance draws most of its electoral support from italy 's poor south , gianfranco fini is a native of the rich northern city of bologna - itself , paradoxically , a traditional communist stronghold .
back in november , mr fini was courting israeli opinion .
mr fini can take comfort from an opinion poll suggesting that his recent condemnation of fascism has the support of 70 % of national alliance supporters fascism , he declared on a visit to israel , had been an " absolute evil " , adding that many italians had acted with " laziness , indifference , complicity and cowardice " in not opposing the anti-jewish laws introduced in 1938 in imitation of nazi germany .
this proved too much for ms mussolini , who stormed out of the national alliance party , saying her family 's honour had been abused .
several other leading party figures also objected , accusing mr fini of political cynicism .
francesco storace , governor of the lazio region , which includes the italian capital rome , called mr fini 's remarks a " media-driven operation " .
mr fini now has his eyes firmly on elections to the european parliament , due to take place in june .
rival party ms mussolini intends to campaign under the banner of a new party , called freedom for action -lrb- liberta d 'azione -rrb- .
however , mr fini can take comfort from an opinion poll , published last month , suggesting that his recent condemnation of fascism has the support of 70 % of national alliance supporters .
many party activists still have a soft spot for the old fascist regime but mr fini is also jockeying for influence within the italian government with the third largest party , the northern league - which , as its name implies , draws its support mainly from the northern provinces and used to advocate the creation of a separate northern state .
the party 's newspaper has dubbed mr fini a " piranha " .
although mr fini expects to humble his own party critics , the continuing arguments strongly suggest that many party activists still have a soft spot for the old fascist regime - or at least regard it as a legitimate part of italy 's heritage .
in fact , mr fini 's own overtures to israel do not necessarily contradict this .
until his alliance with hitler , benito mussolini 's regime maintained close links with parts of the zionist movement and enjoyed considerable support within italy 's jewish community , which saw it as an antidote to the discriminatory attitudes of italy 's " catholic " conservatives .
indeed , recent pro-israeli pronouncements of politicians like mr fini and prime minister silvio berlusconi can be seen in the context of the italian right 's traditional claim to be defending " european civilisation " against a succession of threats - including arab nationalism and muslim militancy .

the conference on saturday will be the first since the defection in november of one of the party 's best known figures , alessandra mussolini .
ms mussolini , granddaughter of italy 's former fascist dictator , left after mr fini called fascism an " absolute evil " .
the national alliance is the second largest party in italy 's four-party coalition government .
fini and mussolini are now rivals it was founded in 1995 , following a split in what was then called the italian social movement , itself built on the ashes of benito mussolini 's fascist movement .
as late as 1994 , mr fini had described mussolini as the " greatest statesman of the 20th century " .
nevertheless , mr fini has been trying to move his party away from its fascist past into the respectable centre-right .
conventional right-left distinctions do not always apply in italy .
regional loyalties matter too - as do people 's own personal and family histories .
alessandra mussolini , a former topless model , is the niece of the film star sophia loren and daughter of benito mussolini 's jazz musician son , romano .
as a politician , she has frequently campaigned on such traditionally " left-wing " issues as women 's rights .
although the national alliance draws most of its electoral support from italy 's poor south , gianfranco fini is a native of the rich northern city of bologna - itself , paradoxically , a traditional communist stronghold .
back in november , mr fini was courting israeli opinion .
mr fini can take comfort from an opinion poll suggesting that his recent condemnation of fascism has the support of 70 % of national alliance supporters fascism , he declared on a visit to israel , had been an " absolute evil " , adding that many italians had acted with " laziness , indifference , complicity and cowardice " in not opposing the anti-jewish laws introduced in 1938 in imitation of nazi germany .
this proved too much for ms mussolini , who stormed out of the national alliance party , saying her family 's honour had been abused .
several other leading party figures also objected , accusing mr fini of political cynicism .
francesco storace , governor of the lazio region , which includes the italian capital rome , called mr fini 's remarks a " media-driven operation " .

however , mr fini can take comfort from an opinion poll , published last month , suggesting that his recent condemnation of fascism has the support of 70 % of national alliance supporters .
many party activists still have a soft spot for the old fascist regime but mr fini is also jockeying for influence within the italian government with the third largest party , the northern league - which , as its name implies , draws its support mainly from the northern provinces and used to advocate the creation of a separate northern state .
the party 's newspaper has dubbed mr fini a " piranha " .
although mr fini expects to humble his own party critics , the continuing arguments strongly suggest that many party activists still have a soft spot for the old fascist regime - or at least regard it as a legitimate part of italy 's heritage .
in fact , mr fini 's own overtures to israel do not necessarily contradict this .
until his alliance with hitler , benito mussolini 's regime maintained close links with parts of the zionist movement and enjoyed considerable support within italy 's jewish community , which saw it as an antidote to the discriminatory attitudes of italy 's " catholic " conservatives .
indeed , recent pro-israeli pronouncements of politicians like mr fini and prime minister silvio berlusconi can be seen in the context of the italian right 's traditional claim to be defending " european civilisation " against a succession of threats - including arab nationalism and muslim militancy .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- italy 's post-fascists to regroup bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 9 january , 2004 , 11:29 gmt italy 's post-fascists to regroup by jan repa bbc europe analyst italy 's deputy prime minister gianfranco fini has called a conference of his national alliance party .
the conference on saturday will be the first since the defection in november of one of the party 's best known figures , alessandra mussolini .
ms mussolini , granddaughter of italy 's former fascist dictator , left after mr fini called fascism an " absolute evil " .
the national alliance is the second largest party in italy 's four-party coalition government .
it was founded in 1995 , following a split in what was then called the italian social movement , itself built on the ashes of benito mussolini 's fascist movement .
as late as 1994 , mr fini had described mussolini as the " greatest statesman of the 20th century " .
nevertheless , mr fini has been trying to move his party away from its fascist past into the respectable centre-right .
conventional right-left distinctions do not always apply in italy .
regional loyalties matter too - as do people 's own personal and family histories .
alessandra mussolini , a former topless model , is the niece of the film star sophia loren and daughter of benito mussolini 's jazz musician son , romano .
as a politician , she has frequently campaigned on such traditionally " left-wing " issues as women 's rights .
although the national alliance draws most of its electoral support from italy 's poor south , gianfranco fini is a native of the rich northern city of bologna - itself , paradoxically , a traditional communist stronghold .
back in november , mr fini was courting israeli opinion . "
mr fini can take comfort from an opinion poll suggesting that his recent condemnation of fascism has the support of 70 % of national alliance supporters " fascism , he declared on a visit to israel , had been an " absolute evil " , adding that many italians had acted with " laziness , indifference , complicity and cowardice " in not opposing the anti-jewish laws introduced in 1938 in imitation of nazi germany .
this proved too much for ms mussolini , who stormed out of the national alliance party , saying her family 's honour had been abused .
several other leading party figures also objected , accusing mr fini of political cynicism .
francesco storace , governor of the lazio region , which includes the italian capital rome , called mr fini 's remarks a " media-driven operation " .
mr fini now has his eyes firmly on elections to the european parliament , due to take place in june .

hong kong 's court of final appeal -lrb- cfa -rrb- dismissed an appeal by the government that is should be allowed to reclaim land around the wanchai district on hong kong island , unless it was in the " overriding public interest . "
the government said it would still review its plans for the wanchai development , in line with criteria laid down by the court .
but it has said reclamation work around the central district will still go ahead , although another appeal case related to that development will be heard next month .
environmental groups have sued the government over both proposals , arguing that they violated a law designed to protect the harbour .
christine loh , chairperson of the hong kong harbour protection campaign told bbc news online she was " very pleased " with today 's cfa ruling .
" the court has provided the most authoritative interpretation of what the law means ... it was passed to protect the harbour , " she said .
" reclamation would result in permanent destruction and irreversible loss of what should be protected and preserved , " a cfa statement said .
review according to the court 's ruling the government will now have to prove that any proposed reclamation was in the " overriding public interest " and had no " reasonable alternative " .
the government would not confirm that plans for the wanchai development would be permanently shelved , arguing that there was still a need to review them .
and the secretary for planning , michael suen , said dredging work would continue for the central project , pending the separate judicial review in february .
" i think what we 're doing there meets legal requirements , " he said .
but environmentalists have also been lobbying against that plan , saying that decades of reclamation have reduced the harbour to half its original size .

the goldie lookin ' chain - all 23 of them - are a music collective from newport , who belt out their own form of hip-hop in the street patois of wales ' newest city .
their anarchic style has already won them a huge following in their own ' hood ' as well as the respect of bands which have already broken through to the charts .
next month may well be crucial for this crew as they support cat-suited rockers , the darkness , on tour and face a home gig rumoured to be packed with talent-scouts from the record labels .
why try and pretend to be a gangsta when all you 're doing is hanging around newport , smoking fags and drinking beers mr love balls the story behind this collective from newport is as home-grown as the way they have built up their following .
the core of the band is eight or nine men in their mid-20s who are all friends from school or college , or drinking partners at their city centre local .
they claim to be " recreating urban poetry " and use many of the words and phrases which they hear on the streets of newport .
a ' clart ' is someone who knows about the glc , a ' bra ' is street speak for ' brother ' .
and like every hip-hop collective , they have stage names to liven up their image , such as : p xain , mystikal , mr love eggs , adam hussein and the maggot .
urban scenery : the glc write about life in newport so far they have five albums to their name , all self-financed and released on cd through local record stores .
the street-wise tactic has created a following which will see them play to more than 1,000 fans in newport next month .
but unlike so-called " gangsta rap , " which has been accused of praising gun culture and criminality , the glc produce songs which celebrate the tracksuit wearing naffness of small town - and now small city - life .
even their name is part of the joke , a joke against themselves and the complete absence of " bling " - the gold and jewellery ostentation toasted in mainstream hip-hop - in the lives of the people they see around them .
john rutledge , one of the founder members , said the glc 's journey began about three years ago .
" it 's hip-hop but it 's exactly the opposite of what hip-hop should be .
" why try and pretend to be a gangsta when all you 're doing is hanging around newport , smoking fags and drinking beers ?
" me and xain sat down one day and started generating some raves - and we 're still in the house and it 's getting fuller and fuller every day .
' cheap bling bling ' " we were writing this stuff because it makes us laugh .
i do n't really care about the political stuff . "
a sometime member of the glc , who goes by the stage name c live -lrb- a wordplay on his christian name -rrb- put it like this : " it was basically observing the characters around newport who are tracksuit-wearing , socks-tucked-in kind of people .
" it 's cheap bling bling .
it is a joke at the lifestyle which is created for the youth of today .
" it started as a laugh but there is a hardcore following .
" it 's obviously going to have a shelf life but they could get a good two or three years out of it .
" it depends how creative they are going to be . "

the goldie lookin ' chain - all 23 of them - are a music collective from newport , who belt out their own form of hip-hop in the street patois of wales ' newest city .
their anarchic style has already won them a huge following in their own ' hood ' as well as the respect of bands which have already broken through to the charts .
next month may well be crucial for this crew as they support cat-suited rockers , the darkness , on tour and face a home gig rumoured to be packed with talent-scouts from the record labels .
why try and pretend to be a gangsta when all you 're doing is hanging around newport , smoking fags and drinking beers mr love balls the story behind this collective from newport is as home-grown as the way they have built up their following .
the core of the band is eight or nine men in their mid-20s who are all friends from school or college , or drinking partners at their city centre local .
they claim to be " recreating urban poetry " and use many of the words and phrases which they hear on the streets of newport .
a ' clart ' is someone who knows about the glc , a ' bra ' is street speak for ' brother ' .
and like every hip-hop collective , they have stage names to liven up their image , such as : p xain , mystikal , mr love eggs , adam hussein and the maggot .
urban scenery : the glc write about life in newport so far they have five albums to their name , all self-financed and released on cd through local record stores .
the street-wise tactic has created a following which will see them play to more than 1,000 fans in newport next month .
but unlike so-called " gangsta rap , " which has been accused of praising gun culture and criminality , the glc produce songs which celebrate the tracksuit wearing naffness of small town - and now small city - life .
even their name is part of the joke , a joke against themselves and the complete absence of " bling " - the gold and jewellery ostentation toasted in mainstream hip-hop - in the lives of the people they see around them .
john rutledge , one of the founder members , said the glc 's journey began about three years ago .
" it 's hip-hop but it 's exactly the opposite of what hip-hop should be .
" why try and pretend to be a gangsta when all you 're doing is hanging around newport , smoking fags and drinking beers ?
" me and xain sat down one day and started generating some raves - and we 're still in the house and it 's getting fuller and fuller every day .
' cheap bling bling ' " we were writing this stuff because it makes us laugh .
i do n't really care about the political stuff . "
a sometime member of the glc , who goes by the stage name c live -lrb- a wordplay on his christian name -rrb- put it like this : " it was basically observing the characters around newport who are tracksuit-wearing , socks-tucked-in kind of people .
" it 's cheap bling bling .
it is a joke at the lifestyle which is created for the youth of today .
" it started as a laugh but there is a hardcore following .
" it 's obviously going to have a shelf life but they could get a good two or three years out of it .
" it depends how creative they are going to be . "

the news comes as apple announces a mini addition to the ipod family that can hold about 1,000 songs and will go on sale in february .
hewlett-packard branded music players are due to appear in the summer .
the agreement marks a change for apple which has formerly been reluctant to licence its technology .
clone wars under the terms of the deal apple will manufacture the devices for hp which will then market them via its own chain of retailers and resellers .
no information has been released about what the player will look like or how much it will cost .
hp has only said they will be priced " competitively " .
apple 's ipod is currently the best-selling portable music player and the company said it had now sold more than 2 million of the gadgets .
the move is seen as an attempt by apple to make the ipod the dominant portable music player and establish its method of formatting music files as the industry standard .
" we 're taking a big step today to further the ipod , " said phil schiller , head of worldwide marketing for apple .
in the past apple has jealously guarded its technology and resisted the temptation to let others make computers based on its hardware .
in the late 1990s it effectively killed off attempts to make clones of its computers by demanding high licence fees .
also included in the deal was an agreement to bundle the itunes music download services onto hp computers .
hp boss carly fiorina said the agreement was struck to help it broaden its strategy to help consumers do more with with digital media such as movies , music and images .

the goldie lookin ' chain - all 23 of them - are a music collective from newport , who belt out their own form of hip-hop in the street patois of wales ' newest city .
their anarchic style has already won them a huge following in their own ' hood ' as well as the respect of bands which have already broken through to the charts .
next month may well be crucial for this crew as they support cat-suited rockers , the darkness , on tour and face a home gig rumoured to be packed with talent-scouts from the record labels . "
why try and pretend to be a gangsta when all you 're doing is hanging around newport , smoking fags and drinking beers " mr love balls the story behind this collective from newport is as home-grown as the way they have built up their following .
the core of the band is eight or nine men in their mid-20s who are all friends from school or college , or drinking partners at their city centre local .
they claim to be " recreating urban poetry " and use many of the words and phrases which they hear on the streets of newport .
a ' clart ' is someone who knows about the glc , a ' bra ' is street speak for ' brother ' .
and like every hip-hop collective , they have stage names to liven up their image , such as : p xain , mystikal , mr love eggs , adam hussein and the maggot .
so far they have five albums to their name , all self-financed and released on cd through local record stores .
the street-wise tactic has created a following which will see them play to more than 1,000 fans in newport next month .
but unlike so-called " gangsta rap , " which has been accused of praising gun culture and criminality , the glc produce songs which celebrate the tracksuit wearing naffness of small town - and now small city - life .
even their name is part of the joke , a joke against themselves and the complete absence of " bling " - the gold and jewellery ostentation toasted in mainstream hip-hop - in the lives of the people they see around them .
john rutledge , one of the founder members , said the glc 's journey began about three years ago .
" it 's hip-hop but it 's exactly the opposite of what hip-hop should be .
" why try and pretend to be a gangsta when all you 're doing is hanging around newport , smoking fags and drinking beers ?
" me and xain sat down one day and started generating some raves - and we 're still in the house and it 's getting fuller and fuller every day .
' cheap bling bling ' " we were writing this stuff because it makes us laugh .
i do n't really care about the political stuff . "
a sometime member of the glc , who goes by the stage name c live -lrb- a wordplay on his christian name -rrb- put it like this : " it was basically observing the characters around newport who are tracksuit-wearing , socks-tucked-in kind of people .
" it 's cheap bling bling .
it is a joke at the lifestyle which is created for the youth of today .
" it started as a laugh but there is a hardcore following .
" it 's obviously going to have a shelf life but they could get a good two or three years out of it .
" it depends how creative they are going to be . "
goldie lookin ' chain support the streets at the london astoria on 2 february , the darkness in portsmouth on 7 february and in folkestone on 8 february .
they headline at the newport city live arena on 6 february .

no more the night mail , crossing the border , bringing no cheque nor postal order .
after more than 160 years of service , the travelling post office - where post is sorted en route on special train services - has finally gone to the sidings .
happier times summed up memorably by wh auden in his verse night mail , cruelly misquoted above , the tpo made its first journey in 1838 from london to the midlands .
by the first world war more than 130 services were in use .
by the end of the second world war only 43 services remained and the 1980s saw further cuts .
the decision to finally bring about the end of the line for tpos was greeted with much sadness .
staff members past and present , together with enthusiasts , see the death of the service as the real great train robbery , as guestbook tributes lovingly left on tpo fan websites show .
the great train robbery proper did , of course , offer the tpo 's most infamous hour when a 15-strong gang made off with about £ 2.3m after holding up a train .
while 3,000 letters an hour were being sorted on the overnight trains , royal mail says automated equipment is now capable of a 30,000 per hour turnover .
the decision to transport post solely by air and road means the end to the " victorian solution to a victorian problem " of moving post around the country .
