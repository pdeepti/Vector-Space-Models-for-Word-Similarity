program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2004 germany 's intercultural business climate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the turkish-german business chamber in april foreigners starting up businesses in germany need to be prepared to bridge a cultural divide .
making the adjustment can be tough , but entrepreneurs from abroad can gain as much from germany as the country does from them . ali haydar berkpinar grew up in turkey , but came to germany while he was still in school .
today he 's the director of the german branch of the turkish carmaker tofa .
he may work in frankfurt , but he 's never forgotten his roots . " in many respects i actually feel like i 'm german , " he said .
" but culturally , speaking of the mental connection , i do think of turkey . " maximilian jaber , a palestinian-jordanian businessman , similarly sees himself as wandering between two cultures .
he 's chairman of the düsseldorf-based it consultancy comcave ag .
both the governments of bahrain and the united arab emirates belong to its list of customers .
but so do the state of baden-württemberg and dortmund 's chamber of commerce . " on one hand , i think like a german .
i also see myself as a citizen of the world .
and when something is about feelings - then i 'm more the emotional arab-palestinian , " jaber said . berkpinar and jaber are two immigrants who took integration for granted long ago : if you want to purse good business you ca n't cut yourself off from german society .
currently there are roughly 60,000 entrepreneurs of turkish origin in germany - and that 's not just the owners of kebab shops and corner fruit and vegetable stores . the hamburg travel agency magnate vural öger and textile maker kemal sahin in aachen are all about big business .
turkish bosses in germany are responsible for around € 30 billion in annual turnover .
they are crucially important taxpayers , creating jobs for more than 350,000 employees . the advantage of a mixed identity " what i first see as a german is reliability and punctuality , " said berkinpar .
" but flexibility of service is more of a turkish trait . " jaber also pointed out differences in mentality , saying his own multicultural identity - an arab business man with a base in germany - is often seen as an advantage .
" i think more globally and try to bring in cultural differences with what i 'm doing .
you become a bit more sensitive in that respect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there a many organizations set up to help entrepreneurs like jaber and berkpinar , such as the arab-german commerce association -lrb- ghorfa -rrb- in berlin and the newly founded turkish-german chamber of industry and commerce in cologne .
that helps cover business issues , but what about cultural difficulties ? conservative muslims often complain that they are not given time to pray during the day while working for german companies .
berkpinar is himself muslim , but orthodox employees do n't have an easier time working for him .
" generally speaking , german employees do n't pray at work either , " he said .
" if they have the need to pray they go to the church during their freetime .
it has no place on the job . " jaber views the matter differently .
he believes a modern and global firm should accommodate the religious needs of the workforce .
however , he also qualifies his support .
" companies in germany are already fighting with enough other problems , " he said .
" so you do n't necessarily need to set up a separate room for praying .
but i think the employees should be able to find a space at the company and use that for a prayer room .

" there are many ways in which i believe the european union can provide assistance , " zebari said . the eu in the past had said it is prepared to do that , but made it conditional that security improved first . the 25-member bloc has committed € 305 million -lrb- $ 371 million -rrb- in humanitarian and reconstruction aid for iraq this year .

the parents argue tui failed to properly warn them of the terror threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community inspect damage in the djerba synagogue .
adrian esper , now aged five , suffered burns on 40 percent of his body during the april 11 , 2002 , blast when a tanker truck filled with cooking gas was crashed into a historic synagogue on the popular vacation island of djerba .
the explosion killed 14 germans , two french nationals and five tunisians , including the suspected bomber . since then adrian has been in and out of the hospital and continues to suffer from grave injuries . the esper family had booked their vacation through 1-2 fly , which belongs to tui .
their visit to the synagogue was part of an excursion package arranged by the company .
the espers contend that tui must have known of a concrete danger to tourists and hence should have warned them . out of court settlement likely tui however , has denied the charges .
tui lawyer alfred pesch argued in court wednesday that the company could not have predicted the attack , saying tunisia showed no signs of violence beforehand . judge knüllig-dingeldey said she would issue a ruling on october 27 , but would prefer an out of court settlement . pesch emphasized that if such a settlement is reached , it should not include a recognition of the company 's guilt and would only be made on humanitarian grounds .
" one can always imagine a compensation , " he said .
the lawyer also demanded that a fundamental legal clarification was necessary for germany 's travel companies . last year , german and tunisian interior ministers , meeting just ahead of the anniversary of the attack , signed an agreement to combat terrorism and other crimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french allege detained german is top al qaeda leader french officials on wednesday accused a german citizen of being a leading member of the al qaeda terrorist network with ties to osama bin laden .

the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .

putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .

the parents argue tui failed to properly warn them of the terror threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community inspect damage in the djerba synagogue .
adrian esper , now aged five , suffered burns on 40 percent of his body during the april 11 , 2002 , blast when a tanker truck filled with cooking gas was crashed into a historic synagogue on the popular vacation island of djerba .
the explosion killed 14 germans , two french nationals and five tunisians , including the suspected bomber . since then adrian has been in and out of the hospital and continues to suffer from grave injuries . the esper family had booked their vacation through 1-2 fly , which belongs to tui .
their visit to the synagogue was part of an excursion package arranged by the company .
the espers contend that tui must have known of a concrete danger to tourists and hence should have warned them . out of court settlement likely tui however , has denied the charges .
tui lawyer alfred pesch argued in court wednesday that the company could not have predicted the attack , saying tunisia showed no signs of violence beforehand . judge knüllig-dingeldey said she would issue a ruling on october 27 , but would prefer an out of court settlement . pesch emphasized that if such a settlement is reached , it should not include a recognition of the company 's guilt and would only be made on humanitarian grounds .
" one can always imagine a compensation , " he said .
the lawyer also demanded that a fundamental legal clarification was necessary for germany 's travel companies . last year , german and tunisian interior ministers , meeting just ahead of the anniversary of the attack , signed an agreement to combat terrorism and other crimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french allege detained german is top al qaeda leader french officials on wednesday accused a german citizen of being a leading member of the al qaeda terrorist network with ties to osama bin laden .

although shadowed by the zugspitze , the second highest peak in germany still attracts crowds of climbers eager to conquer its summit and view the alpine lake below . even though it lacks the prestige of being the highest peak in germany , the watzmann still attracts crowds of mountaineers every year , all eager to conquer the second highest summit in the country . some mountaineers return time and time again to climb the mountain while others take their satisfaction from just one ascent .
even though at 2,713 meters it is dwarfed by the zugspitze , which at 2,962 meters has more to offer , reaching the top of the watzmann is something really quite special . set in bavaria 's berchtesgadener land national park which surrounds the königssee alpine lake , the watzmann offers a great climbing experience in an area well known as the pearl of the german alpine region .
the challenge is one that mountaineers must attempt completely on foot .
ulike the zugspitze , there is no cable car to the peak . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no trip up the watzmann would be complete without a stop at the legendary watzmannhaus .
located 2,000 meters from the base of the most demanding incline on the mountain , the 100-year-old mountaineers ' refuge provides welcome shelter for a brief stop or an overnight stay either on the way up or way down .
whatever direction you are taking , the view from the terrace is breath-taking with a clear view before you and mountains on either side . tours for every ambition there are a number of tours on offer to those wishing to tackle the watzmann .
the most popular is the two-day tour which includes an overnight stay at the watzmannhaus .
there are a number of options as well with different starting points around the base offering tours ranging in time between three to six hours . at the end of the first day , mountaineers are rewarded with the welcome sight of the watzmannhaus , which is managed by the german alpine club and is open from the middle of may until the middle of october .
it is wise for those who wish to stay at the stone construction lodge in the summer season to book a bed well in advance .
dormitories provide a communal atmosphere while smaller , more private rooms are available for two to six persons . choice of summits for different levels on the second day , the push for the summit begins early in the morning as the narrow slope can become congested with human traffic very quickly .
the watzmann consists of three summits : the hocheck at 2,651 meters is relatively easy to climb and takes about two to three hours to complete from the watzmannhaus . the middle point or mittelspitze at 2,713 meters requires a degree of alpine climbing experience .
the south point or südspitze at 2,712 meters and the descent to the wimbachgrieshütte lodge on the other side are only suitable for the confident , very fit mountaineers with the necessary climbing equipment .
the guides who lead the tours know what is required for each peak and are on hand to offer advice . most visitors attempt the hocheck summit and the mittelspitze .
from there , the return journey takes you back to the watzmannhaus which once again offers a welcome resting point before heading back down to the valley below . once back in the valley , those who are still fit and eager have the choice of a number of tours around the königssee which also offers overnight accommodation in huts around the crystal-clear lake . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : caucasian cycle of conflict gunmen release some russian hostages militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 opinion : is chechnya russia 's palestine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 10 years of war , chechens live in desperate conditions russia has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks over the past week , the cause for which lies in chechnya .
the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .
and instead of being embezzled by corrupt civil servants , the funds should be handled transparently , and lead to a real reconstruction of chechnya .
given the high price of oil , russia has enough money , as the 28 percent rise in military expenditure for the 2005 budget shows . such steps demand strength , long-term vision and decisive action from the russian leadership .
otherwise , there is a real danger that chechnya will become the palestine of russia , and that terrorist attacks will - as in israel - become an everyday occurrence . ingo mannteufel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gunmen release some russian hostages gunmen with explosives strapped around their waists took up to 240 people hostage at a school in southern russia near war-torn chechnya wednesday .

extending women 's rights was especially controversial . the turkish government wants to implement the changes , which the opposition party said it will not challenge , quickly - ideally before an october decision by the european commission on whether the eu should begin accession talks with ankara .
the reforms are turkey 's latest batch of legal adjustments , made to boost the country 's chances for eu membership .
in the past two years , turkey passed laws that increased freedom of speech and reduced the role of the military .
" the old laws were focused on the state .
they limited citizens ' freedom to protect the state , " hakki köyklü of the ruling justice and development party said .
" now we 're putting the people in the center . "

although shadowed by the zugspitze , the second highest peak in germany still attracts crowds of climbers eager to conquer its summit and view the alpine lake below . even though it lacks the prestige of being the highest peak in germany , the watzmann still attracts crowds of mountaineers every year , all eager to conquer the second highest summit in the country . some mountaineers return time and time again to climb the mountain while others take their satisfaction from just one ascent .
even though at 2,713 meters it is dwarfed by the zugspitze , which at 2,962 meters has more to offer , reaching the top of the watzmann is something really quite special . set in bavaria 's berchtesgadener land national park which surrounds the königssee alpine lake , the watzmann offers a great climbing experience in an area well known as the pearl of the german alpine region .
the challenge is one that mountaineers must attempt completely on foot .

whatever direction you are taking , the view from the terrace is breath-taking with a clear view before you and mountains on either side . tours for every ambition there are a number of tours on offer to those wishing to tackle the watzmann .
the most popular is the two-day tour which includes an overnight stay at the watzmannhaus .
there are a number of options as well with different starting points around the base offering tours ranging in time between three to six hours . at the end of the first day , mountaineers are rewarded with the welcome sight of the watzmannhaus , which is managed by the german alpine club and is open from the middle of may until the middle of october .
it is wise for those who wish to stay at the stone construction lodge in the summer season to book a bed well in advance .
dormitories provide a communal atmosphere while smaller , more private rooms are available for two to six persons . choice of summits for different levels on the second day , the push for the summit begins early in the morning as the narrow slope can become congested with human traffic very quickly .
the watzmann consists of three summits : the hocheck at 2,651 meters is relatively easy to climb and takes about two to three hours to complete from the watzmannhaus . the middle point or mittelspitze at 2,713 meters requires a degree of alpine climbing experience .
the south point or südspitze at 2,712 meters and the descent to the wimbachgrieshütte lodge on the other side are only suitable for the confident , very fit mountaineers with the necessary climbing equipment .
the guides who lead the tours know what is required for each peak and are on hand to offer advice . most visitors attempt the hocheck summit and the mittelspitze .
from there , the return journey takes you back to the watzmannhaus which once again offers a welcome resting point before heading back down to the valley below . once back in the valley , those who are still fit and eager have the choice of a number of tours around the königssee which also offers overnight accommodation in huts around the crystal-clear lake . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

the parents argue tui failed to properly warn them of the terror threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community inspect damage in the djerba synagogue .
adrian esper , now aged five , suffered burns on 40 percent of his body during the april 11 , 2002 , blast when a tanker truck filled with cooking gas was crashed into a historic synagogue on the popular vacation island of djerba .
the explosion killed 14 germans , two french nationals and five tunisians , including the suspected bomber . since then adrian has been in and out of the hospital and continues to suffer from grave injuries . the esper family had booked their vacation through 1-2 fly , which belongs to tui .
their visit to the synagogue was part of an excursion package arranged by the company .
the espers contend that tui must have known of a concrete danger to tourists and hence should have warned them . out of court settlement likely tui however , has denied the charges .
tui lawyer alfred pesch argued in court wednesday that the company could not have predicted the attack , saying tunisia showed no signs of violence beforehand . judge knüllig-dingeldey said she would issue a ruling on october 27 , but would prefer an out of court settlement . pesch emphasized that if such a settlement is reached , it should not include a recognition of the company 's guilt and would only be made on humanitarian grounds .
" one can always imagine a compensation , " he said .
the lawyer also demanded that a fundamental legal clarification was necessary for germany 's travel companies . last year , german and tunisian interior ministers , meeting just ahead of the anniversary of the attack , signed an agreement to combat terrorism and other crimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french allege detained german is top al qaeda leader french officials on wednesday accused a german citizen of being a leading member of the al qaeda terrorist network with ties to osama bin laden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : caucasian cycle of conflict gunmen release some russian hostages militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 opinion : is chechnya russia 's palestine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 10 years of war , chechens live in desperate conditions russia has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks over the past week , the cause for which lies in chechnya .
the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .

although shadowed by the zugspitze , the second highest peak in germany still attracts crowds of climbers eager to conquer its summit and view the alpine lake below . even though it lacks the prestige of being the highest peak in germany , the watzmann still attracts crowds of mountaineers every year , all eager to conquer the second highest summit in the country . some mountaineers return time and time again to climb the mountain while others take their satisfaction from just one ascent .
even though at 2,713 meters it is dwarfed by the zugspitze , which at 2,962 meters has more to offer , reaching the top of the watzmann is something really quite special . set in bavaria 's berchtesgadener land national park which surrounds the königssee alpine lake , the watzmann offers a great climbing experience in an area well known as the pearl of the german alpine region .
the challenge is one that mountaineers must attempt completely on foot .
ulike the zugspitze , there is no cable car to the peak . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no trip up the watzmann would be complete without a stop at the legendary watzmannhaus .
located 2,000 meters from the base of the most demanding incline on the mountain , the 100-year-old mountaineers ' refuge provides welcome shelter for a brief stop or an overnight stay either on the way up or way down .
whatever direction you are taking , the view from the terrace is breath-taking with a clear view before you and mountains on either side . tours for every ambition there are a number of tours on offer to those wishing to tackle the watzmann .
the most popular is the two-day tour which includes an overnight stay at the watzmannhaus .
there are a number of options as well with different starting points around the base offering tours ranging in time between three to six hours . at the end of the first day , mountaineers are rewarded with the welcome sight of the watzmannhaus , which is managed by the german alpine club and is open from the middle of may until the middle of october .
it is wise for those who wish to stay at the stone construction lodge in the summer season to book a bed well in advance .
dormitories provide a communal atmosphere while smaller , more private rooms are available for two to six persons . choice of summits for different levels on the second day , the push for the summit begins early in the morning as the narrow slope can become congested with human traffic very quickly .
the watzmann consists of three summits : the hocheck at 2,651 meters is relatively easy to climb and takes about two to three hours to complete from the watzmannhaus . the middle point or mittelspitze at 2,713 meters requires a degree of alpine climbing experience .
the south point or südspitze at 2,712 meters and the descent to the wimbachgrieshütte lodge on the other side are only suitable for the confident , very fit mountaineers with the necessary climbing equipment .
the guides who lead the tours know what is required for each peak and are on hand to offer advice . most visitors attempt the hocheck summit and the mittelspitze .
from there , the return journey takes you back to the watzmannhaus which once again offers a welcome resting point before heading back down to the valley below . once back in the valley , those who are still fit and eager have the choice of a number of tours around the königssee which also offers overnight accommodation in huts around the crystal-clear lake . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

making the adjustment can be tough , but entrepreneurs from abroad can gain as much from germany as the country does from them . ali haydar berkpinar grew up in turkey , but came to germany while he was still in school .
today he 's the director of the german branch of the turkish carmaker tofa .
he may work in frankfurt , but he 's never forgotten his roots . " in many respects i actually feel like i 'm german , " he said .
" but culturally , speaking of the mental connection , i do think of turkey . " maximilian jaber , a palestinian-jordanian businessman , similarly sees himself as wandering between two cultures .
he 's chairman of the düsseldorf-based it consultancy comcave ag .
both the governments of bahrain and the united arab emirates belong to its list of customers .
but so do the state of baden-württemberg and dortmund 's chamber of commerce . " on one hand , i think like a german .
i also see myself as a citizen of the world .
and when something is about feelings - then i 'm more the emotional arab-palestinian , " jaber said . berkpinar and jaber are two immigrants who took integration for granted long ago : if you want to purse good business you ca n't cut yourself off from german society .
currently there are roughly 60,000 entrepreneurs of turkish origin in germany - and that 's not just the owners of kebab shops and corner fruit and vegetable stores . the hamburg travel agency magnate vural öger and textile maker kemal sahin in aachen are all about big business .
turkish bosses in germany are responsible for around € 30 billion in annual turnover .
they are crucially important taxpayers , creating jobs for more than 350,000 employees . the advantage of a mixed identity " what i first see as a german is reliability and punctuality , " said berkinpar .
" but flexibility of service is more of a turkish trait . " jaber also pointed out differences in mentality , saying his own multicultural identity - an arab business man with a base in germany - is often seen as an advantage .
" i think more globally and try to bring in cultural differences with what i 'm doing .
you become a bit more sensitive in that respect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there a many organizations set up to help entrepreneurs like jaber and berkpinar , such as the arab-german commerce association -lrb- ghorfa -rrb- in berlin and the newly founded turkish-german chamber of industry and commerce in cologne .
that helps cover business issues , but what about cultural difficulties ? conservative muslims often complain that they are not given time to pray during the day while working for german companies .
berkpinar is himself muslim , but orthodox employees do n't have an easier time working for him .
" generally speaking , german employees do n't pray at work either , " he said .
" if they have the need to pray they go to the church during their freetime .
it has no place on the job . " jaber views the matter differently .
he believes a modern and global firm should accommodate the religious needs of the workforce .
however , he also qualifies his support .
" companies in germany are already fighting with enough other problems , " he said .
" so you do n't necessarily need to set up a separate room for praying .
but i think the employees should be able to find a space at the company and use that for a prayer room .

their visit to the synagogue was part of an excursion package arranged by the company .
the espers contend that tui must have known of a concrete danger to tourists and hence should have warned them . out of court settlement likely tui however , has denied the charges .
tui lawyer alfred pesch argued in court wednesday that the company could not have predicted the attack , saying tunisia showed no signs of violence beforehand . judge knüllig-dingeldey said she would issue a ruling on october 27 , but would prefer an out of court settlement . pesch emphasized that if such a settlement is reached , it should not include a recognition of the company 's guilt and would only be made on humanitarian grounds .
" one can always imagine a compensation , " he said .

the berlin-based diw expects the deficit in 2005 to be 3.3 percent of gdp , breaking the european union 's 3 percent limit for a fourth year , the institute said in a statement e-mailed to news organizations .
the diw 's previous forecast , from july , was for a 3.2 percent deficit next year .
german finance minister hans eichel announced on tuesday that he had raised the deficit forecast for this year to 3.7 percent , saying lower-than- expected tax income , increased spending on unemployment and a drop in the bundesbank 's profit had pushed up the shortfall .
eichel said the government still plans to bring the deficit below 3 percent in 2005 . more briefs 31.08.2004 -pipe- vw does n't want daimlerchrysler 's bernhard 31.08.2004 -pipe- clement gives € 400 million to job centers 30.08.2004 -pipe- westlb negotiates sale of tui shares 30.08.2004 -pipe- german firms increasingly leaving home 30.08.2004 -pipe- germany loses out in chinese railway upgrade 27.08.2004 -pipe- german consumer confidence sinks 27.08.2004 -pipe- vw managers offer wage freeze 27.08.2004 -pipe- siemens lowers q4 target on mobile defect radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 -pipe- 07:00 utc dutch doubt euro pact reform will happen in 2004 dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told the economic and monetary affairs committee in the european parliament : " i am waiting for the european commission proposals , but i am not certain that we will reach an accord on reforming the -lsb- stability and growth -rsb- pact under the dutch presidency . "
zalm , who has always argued for the rules to be strictly implemented , was widely seen as a hardliner in the damaging row that took place between the commission and some member states , notably france and germany , last november .
but he said on tuesday that he wishes to avoid a repeat of this conflict - which resulted in the case being taken to the european court of justice - during the reform debate .
" what i certainly do n't want is to have again a big clash like we had in november , " he said .
" so if we do reach anything , it should be by consensus and agreement . "
the reform proposals are expected to suggest changes to the circumstances under which a deficit of over three percent is allowed and to take the individual economic situations of member states into account when assessing these excessive deficits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2004 germany 's intercultural business climate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the turkish-german business chamber in april foreigners starting up businesses in germany need to be prepared to bridge a cultural divide .
making the adjustment can be tough , but entrepreneurs from abroad can gain as much from germany as the country does from them . ali haydar berkpinar grew up in turkey , but came to germany while he was still in school .
today he 's the director of the german branch of the turkish carmaker tofa .
he may work in frankfurt , but he 's never forgotten his roots . " in many respects i actually feel like i 'm german , " he said .
" but culturally , speaking of the mental connection , i do think of turkey . " maximilian jaber , a palestinian-jordanian businessman , similarly sees himself as wandering between two cultures .
he 's chairman of the düsseldorf-based it consultancy comcave ag .
both the governments of bahrain and the united arab emirates belong to its list of customers .
but so do the state of baden-württemberg and dortmund 's chamber of commerce . " on one hand , i think like a german .
i also see myself as a citizen of the world .
and when something is about feelings - then i 'm more the emotional arab-palestinian , " jaber said . berkpinar and jaber are two immigrants who took integration for granted long ago : if you want to purse good business you ca n't cut yourself off from german society .
currently there are roughly 60,000 entrepreneurs of turkish origin in germany - and that 's not just the owners of kebab shops and corner fruit and vegetable stores . the hamburg travel agency magnate vural öger and textile maker kemal sahin in aachen are all about big business .
turkish bosses in germany are responsible for around € 30 billion in annual turnover .
they are crucially important taxpayers , creating jobs for more than 350,000 employees . the advantage of a mixed identity " what i first see as a german is reliability and punctuality , " said berkinpar .
" but flexibility of service is more of a turkish trait . " jaber also pointed out differences in mentality , saying his own multicultural identity - an arab business man with a base in germany - is often seen as an advantage .
" i think more globally and try to bring in cultural differences with what i 'm doing .
you become a bit more sensitive in that respect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there a many organizations set up to help entrepreneurs like jaber and berkpinar , such as the arab-german commerce association -lrb- ghorfa -rrb- in berlin and the newly founded turkish-german chamber of industry and commerce in cologne .
that helps cover business issues , but what about cultural difficulties ? conservative muslims often complain that they are not given time to pray during the day while working for german companies .
berkpinar is himself muslim , but orthodox employees do n't have an easier time working for him .
" generally speaking , german employees do n't pray at work either , " he said .
" if they have the need to pray they go to the church during their freetime .
it has no place on the job . " jaber views the matter differently .
he believes a modern and global firm should accommodate the religious needs of the workforce .
however , he also qualifies his support .
" companies in germany are already fighting with enough other problems , " he said .

today he 's the director of the german branch of the turkish carmaker tofa .
he may work in frankfurt , but he 's never forgotten his roots . " in many respects i actually feel like i 'm german , " he said .

currently there are roughly 60,000 entrepreneurs of turkish origin in germany - and that 's not just the owners of kebab shops and corner fruit and vegetable stores . the hamburg travel agency magnate vural öger and textile maker kemal sahin in aachen are all about big business .

they are crucially important taxpayers , creating jobs for more than 350,000 employees . the advantage of a mixed identity " what i first see as a german is reliability and punctuality , " said berkinpar .
" but flexibility of service is more of a turkish trait . " jaber also pointed out differences in mentality , saying his own multicultural identity - an arab business man with a base in germany - is often seen as an advantage .

" generally speaking , german employees do n't pray at work either , " he said .
" if they have the need to pray they go to the church during their freetime .

however , he also qualifies his support .

"
the commissioner went on to say that he was against the idea , proposed recently by the dutch government 's advisory council , that turkey be given the green light for eu membership but that negotiations only begin in two years .
" i think that would amount to a further two years delay " , verheugen said .
instead , he gave a more definite timeline .
he referred to a statement made by member states in copenhagen in 2002 which said that if a positive decision is reached on turkey then negotiations should be opened " without delay . "
" without delay means between four and six months , " he said .
verheugen rejected calls by some meps for a partnership agreement between the eu and turkey reminding them that union has committed itself to ankara 's membership and that the only issue now is whether it fulfils the eu 's political criteria .
the commission 's report - due out on oct .
6 - will also look at the effect of turkish membership on the eu 's institutions .

the former communist party , which failed to amass the critical 5 percent hurdle to enter germany 's parliament in the last general elections in 2002 , is now benefiting from the public 's general frustration with chancellor gerhard schröder 's party of social democrats .

according to the pollster group forsa , seven percent of germans would vote for the pds if national elections were on sunday .
the mainstream parties would remain constant in their ratings : the social democrats would receive 26 percent of the vote , the opposition christian democrats union would get 42 percent and the neo-liberal free democrats would garner 8 percent .
only the greens would see their approval drop by one percentage point down to 12 percent .
the survey polled 2,504 eligible voters . dw-world.de a new east-west divide in germany ?
more marches against the hartz iv welfare reforms took place on monday .

the berlin-based diw expects the deficit in 2005 to be 3.3 percent of gdp , breaking the european union 's 3 percent limit for a fourth year , the institute said in a statement e-mailed to news organizations .
the diw 's previous forecast , from july , was for a 3.2 percent deficit next year .
german finance minister hans eichel announced on tuesday that he had raised the deficit forecast for this year to 3.7 percent , saying lower-than- expected tax income , increased spending on unemployment and a drop in the bundesbank 's profit had pushed up the shortfall .
eichel said the government still plans to bring the deficit below 3 percent in 2005 . more briefs 31.08.2004 -pipe- vw does n't want daimlerchrysler 's bernhard 31.08.2004 -pipe- clement gives € 400 million to job centers 30.08.2004 -pipe- westlb negotiates sale of tui shares 30.08.2004 -pipe- german firms increasingly leaving home 30.08.2004 -pipe- germany loses out in chinese railway upgrade 27.08.2004 -pipe- german consumer confidence sinks 27.08.2004 -pipe- vw managers offer wage freeze 27.08.2004 -pipe- siemens lowers q4 target on mobile defect radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

although shadowed by the zugspitze , the second highest peak in germany still attracts crowds of climbers eager to conquer its summit and view the alpine lake below . even though it lacks the prestige of being the highest peak in germany , the watzmann still attracts crowds of mountaineers every year , all eager to conquer the second highest summit in the country . some mountaineers return time and time again to climb the mountain while others take their satisfaction from just one ascent .
even though at 2,713 meters it is dwarfed by the zugspitze , which at 2,962 meters has more to offer , reaching the top of the watzmann is something really quite special . set in bavaria 's berchtesgadener land national park which surrounds the königssee alpine lake , the watzmann offers a great climbing experience in an area well known as the pearl of the german alpine region .

the watzmann consists of three summits : the hocheck at 2,651 meters is relatively easy to climb and takes about two to three hours to complete from the watzmannhaus . the middle point or mittelspitze at 2,713 meters requires a degree of alpine climbing experience .
the south point or südspitze at 2,712 meters and the descent to the wimbachgrieshütte lodge on the other side are only suitable for the confident , very fit mountaineers with the necessary climbing equipment .
the guides who lead the tours know what is required for each peak and are on hand to offer advice . most visitors attempt the hocheck summit and the mittelspitze .
from there , the return journey takes you back to the watzmannhaus which once again offers a welcome resting point before heading back down to the valley below . once back in the valley , those who are still fit and eager have the choice of a number of tours around the königssee which also offers overnight accommodation in huts around the crystal-clear lake . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

although shadowed by the zugspitze , the second highest peak in germany still attracts crowds of climbers eager to conquer its summit and view the alpine lake below . even though it lacks the prestige of being the highest peak in germany , the watzmann still attracts crowds of mountaineers every year , all eager to conquer the second highest summit in the country . some mountaineers return time and time again to climb the mountain while others take their satisfaction from just one ascent .
even though at 2,713 meters it is dwarfed by the zugspitze , which at 2,962 meters has more to offer , reaching the top of the watzmann is something really quite special . set in bavaria 's berchtesgadener land national park which surrounds the königssee alpine lake , the watzmann offers a great climbing experience in an area well known as the pearl of the german alpine region .
the challenge is one that mountaineers must attempt completely on foot .
ulike the zugspitze , there is no cable car to the peak . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no trip up the watzmann would be complete without a stop at the legendary watzmannhaus .
located 2,000 meters from the base of the most demanding incline on the mountain , the 100-year-old mountaineers ' refuge provides welcome shelter for a brief stop or an overnight stay either on the way up or way down .
whatever direction you are taking , the view from the terrace is breath-taking with a clear view before you and mountains on either side . tours for every ambition there are a number of tours on offer to those wishing to tackle the watzmann .
the most popular is the two-day tour which includes an overnight stay at the watzmannhaus .
there are a number of options as well with different starting points around the base offering tours ranging in time between three to six hours . at the end of the first day , mountaineers are rewarded with the welcome sight of the watzmannhaus , which is managed by the german alpine club and is open from the middle of may until the middle of october .
it is wise for those who wish to stay at the stone construction lodge in the summer season to book a bed well in advance .
dormitories provide a communal atmosphere while smaller , more private rooms are available for two to six persons . choice of summits for different levels on the second day , the push for the summit begins early in the morning as the narrow slope can become congested with human traffic very quickly .
the watzmann consists of three summits : the hocheck at 2,651 meters is relatively easy to climb and takes about two to three hours to complete from the watzmannhaus . the middle point or mittelspitze at 2,713 meters requires a degree of alpine climbing experience .
the south point or südspitze at 2,712 meters and the descent to the wimbachgrieshütte lodge on the other side are only suitable for the confident , very fit mountaineers with the necessary climbing equipment .
the guides who lead the tours know what is required for each peak and are on hand to offer advice . most visitors attempt the hocheck summit and the mittelspitze .
from there , the return journey takes you back to the watzmannhaus which once again offers a welcome resting point before heading back down to the valley below . once back in the valley , those who are still fit and eager have the choice of a number of tours around the königssee which also offers overnight accommodation in huts around the crystal-clear lake . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

1 , 1939 , adolf hitler announced that german troops had marched into poland .
the evening before , ss soldiers disguised as poles attacked the radio station of gleiwitz , a town on the german-polish border , and transmitted a message for the polish minority in the region to take arms against the germans .
this fictitious act of aggression was to serve as an alibi for the attack on poland . hitler had long been on the warpath .
fifteen years previously , he wrote in his book " mein kampf , " that the germans should seize more lebensraum - living space .
besides , his rationale went , peace between populations was impossible .
only war could determine survival . relations with poland were already strained during the weimar republic , due to the 1919 treaty of versailles , which laid down territorial acts of transfer to poland .
the state of east prussia was separated from the german reich by a polish corridor , something barely any german politicians were prepared to accept . strategy of deception when the national socialists took power in 1933 , hitler pursued closer ties to poland for tactical reasons - he wanted to create an impression , at least to outsiders , of his readiness for peace .
in 1934 , he signed a pact of non-aggression with poland . " there may be differences between our two countries in future , but the catastrophic effects of trying to solve them through actions of war would in no way be in proportion to any possible gain , " hitler said .
" the german government was therefore pleased to find that the leader of the polish state , marshall pilsudski , shares this opinion , and that this mutual realization has been turned into a contract , that wo n't just be of equal use to the polish and german peoples , but also will contribute significantly to the preservation of peace generally . " but the truth was that peace was not on hitler 's agenda .
instead of pursuing peace , he fuelled his plans for expansion .
in 1938 , austria was annexed by the german reich , then czechoslovakia - both without any military resistance . poland 's weak position poland 's fate was sealed when , at the end of august , 1939 , hitler surprisingly negotiated a pact of non-aggression with stalin .
in a secret protocol , it was decided - poland would be divided up between germany and the soviet union .
just one week later , germany marched on poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as nazi germany starts the invasion of its neighbor poland in the early morning hours of september 1 , 1939 , these german soldiers tear down a barrier at the german-polish border , at an unknown location .
although the polish government knew of germany 's war preparations , the attack came as a surprise .
in the early morning hours of sept .
1 , the german battleship " schleswig-holstein " opened fire on the polish city of danzig .
hours later , hitler spoke in front of the reichstag assembly . " those who distance themselves from the rules of humane warfare can expect nothing else from us but that we do the same , " he said .
" and i will lead this war - no matter whom we fight - until such time that the security of the reich is guaranteed . " two days later , england and france declared war on germany .

the berlin-based diw expects the deficit in 2005 to be 3.3 percent of gdp , breaking the european union 's 3 percent limit for a fourth year , the institute said in a statement e-mailed to news organizations .
the diw 's previous forecast , from july , was for a 3.2 percent deficit next year .
german finance minister hans eichel announced on tuesday that he had raised the deficit forecast for this year to 3.7 percent , saying lower-than- expected tax income , increased spending on unemployment and a drop in the bundesbank 's profit had pushed up the shortfall .
eichel said the government still plans to bring the deficit below 3 percent in 2005 . more briefs 31.08.2004 -pipe- vw does n't want daimlerchrysler 's bernhard 31.08.2004 -pipe- clement gives € 400 million to job centers 30.08.2004 -pipe- westlb negotiates sale of tui shares 30.08.2004 -pipe- german firms increasingly leaving home 30.08.2004 -pipe- germany loses out in chinese railway upgrade 27.08.2004 -pipe- german consumer confidence sinks 27.08.2004 -pipe- vw managers offer wage freeze 27.08.2004 -pipe- siemens lowers q4 target on mobile defect radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the parents argue tui failed to properly warn them of the terror threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community inspect damage in the djerba synagogue .
adrian esper , now aged five , suffered burns on 40 percent of his body during the april 11 , 2002 , blast when a tanker truck filled with cooking gas was crashed into a historic synagogue on the popular vacation island of djerba .
the explosion killed 14 germans , two french nationals and five tunisians , including the suspected bomber . since then adrian has been in and out of the hospital and continues to suffer from grave injuries . the esper family had booked their vacation through 1-2 fly , which belongs to tui .
their visit to the synagogue was part of an excursion package arranged by the company .
the espers contend that tui must have known of a concrete danger to tourists and hence should have warned them . out of court settlement likely tui however , has denied the charges .
tui lawyer alfred pesch argued in court wednesday that the company could not have predicted the attack , saying tunisia showed no signs of violence beforehand . judge knüllig-dingeldey said she would issue a ruling on october 27 , but would prefer an out of court settlement . pesch emphasized that if such a settlement is reached , it should not include a recognition of the company 's guilt and would only be made on humanitarian grounds .
" one can always imagine a compensation , " he said .
the lawyer also demanded that a fundamental legal clarification was necessary for germany 's travel companies . last year , german and tunisian interior ministers , meeting just ahead of the anniversary of the attack , signed an agreement to combat terrorism and other crimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french allege detained german is top al qaeda leader french officials on wednesday accused a german citizen of being a leading member of the al qaeda terrorist network with ties to osama bin laden .

the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .
and instead of being embezzled by corrupt civil servants , the funds should be handled transparently , and lead to a real reconstruction of chechnya .
given the high price of oil , russia has enough money , as the 28 percent rise in military expenditure for the 2005 budget shows . such steps demand strength , long-term vision and decisive action from the russian leadership .
otherwise , there is a real danger that chechnya will become the palestine of russia , and that terrorist attacks will - as in israel - become an everyday occurrence . ingo mannteufel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gunmen release some russian hostages gunmen with explosives strapped around their waists took up to 240 people hostage at a school in southern russia near war-torn chechnya wednesday .

the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .

the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .

13 " there will be no set agenda " , said a spanish government press release , according to the associated press .
" they will discuss general questions of both european and international issues . "
spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero has also invited jacques chirac and gerhard schröder - his french and german counterparts - to dinner in madrid .
the meeting follows comments by zapetero a month ago that his country should be alongside france and germany as the " decisive countries for the european construction . "
spanish authorities were quick to dismiss any speculation that the axis of power is shifting in europe .
" there is a franco-german axis which is the motor of the eu and which meets regularly with its principal partners .
this meeting is taking place in this context , " said a government spokesman , quoted by france deux .
all three leaders were opposed to the us-led war in iraq .

all countries that joined the eu on may 1 .
across six out of the 10 new eu nations that provided statistics , the number of asylum requests increased an average of 26 percent in the second quarter of 2004 as compared to the january-march period of this year . this pattern is due in part to the fact that applying for asylum in ex-soviet bloc countries has simply become much easier , said unhcr spokesman rupert colville . " they had no asylum laws , no asylum system at all , before the fall of the soviet union , " he told reporters .
" that gradually got better , " he added , saying that reaching a certain procedural standard for handling asylum requests " was one of the requirements for entry in the european union . "
another factor contributing to this new influx is that many of the affected countries are the first point of entry along major axes of immigration from the far east , afghanistan and chechnya , colville said .
law could see news states overwhelmed the unhcr expressed concern that european legislation making it possible to send back asylum seekers to the first eu country in which they sought refuge could overwhelm the fledgling asylum offices in these new eu nations . " they are perhaps still less well placed to cope with a major influx than the old eu countries , " colville noted . overall , asylum requests in europe have dropped off in recent years , especially in the core eu countries with long-established traditions of political asylum .
in the 30 industrialized nations covered by the unhcr study the number of petitioners in the second quarter of 2004 was 86,600 , the lowest figure in 17 years and eight percent less than the preceding quarter .
already in 2003 , asylum requests dropped 20 percent as compared to the year before , due mainly to fewer refugees from afghanistan and iraq .
traditional refuges record drop in petitions though france registered the highest number of requests in europe for the third straight quarter , the number dropped 11 percent in the second quarter this year as compared to the same period in 2003 .
in germany the decrease was 16 percent and in britain 13 percent .
so far in 2004 , germany 's federal office for the recognition of foreign refugees has reviewed 30,566 petitions for refugee status with the main countries of origin being turkey , serbia and montenegro , and the russian federation , followed by iran and azerbaijan .
russians - presumably mainly from chechnya - remain the single largest group among countries of origin , though the number of requests dropped four percent over the corresponding period .

all countries that joined the eu on may 1 .
across six out of the 10 new eu nations that provided statistics , the number of asylum requests increased an average of 26 percent in the second quarter of 2004 as compared to the january-march period of this year . this pattern is due in part to the fact that applying for asylum in ex-soviet bloc countries has simply become much easier , said unhcr spokesman rupert colville . " they had no asylum laws , no asylum system at all , before the fall of the soviet union , " he told reporters .
" that gradually got better , " he added , saying that reaching a certain procedural standard for handling asylum requests " was one of the requirements for entry in the european union . "
another factor contributing to this new influx is that many of the affected countries are the first point of entry along major axes of immigration from the far east , afghanistan and chechnya , colville said .
law could see news states overwhelmed the unhcr expressed concern that european legislation making it possible to send back asylum seekers to the first eu country in which they sought refuge could overwhelm the fledgling asylum offices in these new eu nations . " they are perhaps still less well placed to cope with a major influx than the old eu countries , " colville noted . overall , asylum requests in europe have dropped off in recent years , especially in the core eu countries with long-established traditions of political asylum .
in the 30 industrialized nations covered by the unhcr study the number of petitioners in the second quarter of 2004 was 86,600 , the lowest figure in 17 years and eight percent less than the preceding quarter .
already in 2003 , asylum requests dropped 20 percent as compared to the year before , due mainly to fewer refugees from afghanistan and iraq .
traditional refuges record drop in petitions though france registered the highest number of requests in europe for the third straight quarter , the number dropped 11 percent in the second quarter this year as compared to the same period in 2003 .
in germany the decrease was 16 percent and in britain 13 percent .
so far in 2004 , germany 's federal office for the recognition of foreign refugees has reviewed 30,566 petitions for refugee status with the main countries of origin being turkey , serbia and montenegro , and the russian federation , followed by iran and azerbaijan .
russians - presumably mainly from chechnya - remain the single largest group among countries of origin , though the number of requests dropped four percent over the corresponding period .
there were also decreases from other countries , notably 7 percent from serbia , 11 percent from china , 22 percent from turkey and 25 percent from india . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach breakthrough on eu asylum policy eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .

the parents argue tui failed to properly warn them of the terror threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community inspect damage in the djerba synagogue .
adrian esper , now aged five , suffered burns on 40 percent of his body during the april 11 , 2002 , blast when a tanker truck filled with cooking gas was crashed into a historic synagogue on the popular vacation island of djerba .
the explosion killed 14 germans , two french nationals and five tunisians , including the suspected bomber . since then adrian has been in and out of the hospital and continues to suffer from grave injuries . the esper family had booked their vacation through 1-2 fly , which belongs to tui .
their visit to the synagogue was part of an excursion package arranged by the company .
the espers contend that tui must have known of a concrete danger to tourists and hence should have warned them . out of court settlement likely tui however , has denied the charges .
tui lawyer alfred pesch argued in court wednesday that the company could not have predicted the attack , saying tunisia showed no signs of violence beforehand . judge knüllig-dingeldey said she would issue a ruling on october 27 , but would prefer an out of court settlement . pesch emphasized that if such a settlement is reached , it should not include a recognition of the company 's guilt and would only be made on humanitarian grounds .
" one can always imagine a compensation , " he said .
the lawyer also demanded that a fundamental legal clarification was necessary for germany 's travel companies . last year , german and tunisian interior ministers , meeting just ahead of the anniversary of the attack , signed an agreement to combat terrorism and other crimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french allege detained german is top al qaeda leader french officials on wednesday accused a german citizen of being a leading member of the al qaeda terrorist network with ties to osama bin laden .

unlike most other industrialized nations , germany does not legally ensure free access to official information .
but if current plans by the government go into effect , this could soon change . many german citizens would love to have a look at the illegal contracts reportedly awarded by the federal labor office last year or the ongoing contractual muddle surrounding germany ’ s truck toll system .
but these files are closed to the public eye .
while most other european countries have laws which allow their citizens access to government files , germany has yet to introduce such legislation .
" the most important reason for this is that german civil servants are stuck to the notion that everything they do should be kept secret , " said reinhold thiel , board member of global watchdog transparency international 's german chapter .
" it ’ s a relic of the old authoritarian state , " thiel told dw-world .
but this no longer fits to the information age in a modern democracy .
" transparency can also help to expose and prevent corruption , " he added .
ending the secrets the german chapter of transparency international is one of a group of organizations and trade unions that have come together to promote legislation giving citizens the right to access federal government files .
the group , pro-information.de , has passed its suggestions for a so-called informationsfreiheitsgesetz -lrb- ifg -rrb- or freedom of information law on to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the files of the east german secret service stasi are off-limits to many the social democrat-green coalition government , it appears , is all ears .
an ifg is part of their current coalition treaty , as it was in the last legislation period .
" there were already two previous drafts , but there was too much opposition by various ministries , " said thiel .
now , the red-green factions are reworking the law , which would put an end to the principle of nondisclosure .
currently in germany , only people directly affected by a procedure can apply to access government records and they must justify their reasons for disclosure .
the ifg would change this by putting the onus for justification on the ministry and requiring that government officials provide reasons for not releasing information .
inf ormation access not a basic right for german industry , the planned ifg is a step in the wrong direction .
many companies fear that their price calculations will be made public in connection with tender offers .
or that certain trade and business secrets could come to light .
" it will make it very easy for anyone to look into the inner core of a company 's know-how , " said sigrid hintzen from the legal department at german industry federation bdi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies fear everyone will know just how they budget their contracts the greens and social democrats have said they will ensure that such business secrets are protected from release .
but this is not a solution , bdi fears .
" this would mean that companies have to double-check all of their documents and mark confidential information , " hintzen told dw-world .
" it 's unnecessary additional work . "
according to edda müller , executive director of the federation of german consumer organizations , more transparency in public administration is essential for consumers .
" authorities need to show how seriously they take consumer protection and how effectively they want to protect citizens ' interests , " müller said .
" we have to finally anchor this right for information access in germany . "
bdi , which has not been given the law 's text for review , disagrees .
" examining official files is not a basic right , " said hintzen .
success on the state level the forerunner for germany 's ifg is the freedom of information act -lrb- foia -rrb- in the united states .
introduced in 1966 , the foia has become one of the most crucial instruments to journalists and other citizens for understanding events behind the scenes - and to elicit unpleasant secrets from the government .
when the pentagon recently forbid the release of photographs showing soldiers ' remains returning home from iraq , an foia request resulted in their publication .
advocates of the ifg point to such instances as proof that disclosure can be positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-green government feels every citizen should have access to federal files critics of the ifg , on the other hand , worry that germany 's very strong data protection laws could be watered down in a new information act .
but , thiel of transparency international said , personal information will be excluded from disclosure .
there will also be an information ban regarding intelligence work , the foreign office or the defense ministry , he added .
on a state level , four german länder have already introduced freedom of information laws : brandenburg , berlin , north rhine-westphalia and schleswig-holstein .
the experiences there showed that citizens were not storming the authorities to get information , as many had feared .
hansjürgen garstka , berlin 's appointee for data protection and freedom of information , stressed that he and his colleagues have only seen positive results of the law .
" it is urgent that the federal government and the other states also take this path to more transparency and democracy , " garstka said .
no longer a " secretive opponent " during its first session in 1946 , the united nations general assembly adopted a resolution , which stated : " freedom of information is a fundamental human right and -lrb- … -rrb- the touchstone of all the freedoms to which the un is consecrated . "
supporters of such legislation say it is high time germany passes its own ifg .

unlike most other industrialized nations , germany does not legally ensure free access to official information .
but if current plans by the government go into effect , this could soon change . many german citizens would love to have a look at the illegal contracts reportedly awarded by the federal labor office last year or the ongoing contractual muddle surrounding germany ’ s truck toll system .
but these files are closed to the public eye .
while most other european countries have laws which allow their citizens access to government files , germany has yet to introduce such legislation .
" the most important reason for this is that german civil servants are stuck to the notion that everything they do should be kept secret , " said reinhold thiel , board member of global watchdog transparency international 's german chapter .
" it ’ s a relic of the old authoritarian state , " thiel told dw-world .
but this no longer fits to the information age in a modern democracy .
" transparency can also help to expose and prevent corruption , " he added .
ending the secrets the german chapter of transparency international is one of a group of organizations and trade unions that have come together to promote legislation giving citizens the right to access federal government files .
the group , pro-information.de , has passed its suggestions for a so-called informationsfreiheitsgesetz -lrb- ifg -rrb- or freedom of information law on to berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the files of the east german secret service stasi are off-limits to many the social democrat-green coalition government , it appears , is all ears .
an ifg is part of their current coalition treaty , as it was in the last legislation period .
" there were already two previous drafts , but there was too much opposition by various ministries , " said thiel .
now , the red-green factions are reworking the law , which would put an end to the principle of nondisclosure .
currently in germany , only people directly affected by a procedure can apply to access government records and they must justify their reasons for disclosure .
the ifg would change this by putting the onus for justification on the ministry and requiring that government officials provide reasons for not releasing information .
inf ormation access not a basic right for german industry , the planned ifg is a step in the wrong direction .
many companies fear that their price calculations will be made public in connection with tender offers .
or that certain trade and business secrets could come to light .
" it will make it very easy for anyone to look into the inner core of a company 's know-how , " said sigrid hintzen from the legal department at german industry federation bdi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies fear everyone will know just how they budget their contracts the greens and social democrats have said they will ensure that such business secrets are protected from release .
but this is not a solution , bdi fears .
" this would mean that companies have to double-check all of their documents and mark confidential information , " hintzen told dw-world .
" it 's unnecessary additional work . "
according to edda müller , executive director of the federation of german consumer organizations , more transparency in public administration is essential for consumers .
" authorities need to show how seriously they take consumer protection and how effectively they want to protect citizens ' interests , " müller said .
" we have to finally anchor this right for information access in germany . "
bdi , which has not been given the law 's text for review , disagrees .
" examining official files is not a basic right , " said hintzen .
success on the state level the forerunner for germany 's ifg is the freedom of information act -lrb- foia -rrb- in the united states .
introduced in 1966 , the foia has become one of the most crucial instruments to journalists and other citizens for understanding events behind the scenes - and to elicit unpleasant secrets from the government .
when the pentagon recently forbid the release of photographs showing soldiers ' remains returning home from iraq , an foia request resulted in their publication .
advocates of the ifg point to such instances as proof that disclosure can be positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-green government feels every citizen should have access to federal files critics of the ifg , on the other hand , worry that germany 's very strong data protection laws could be watered down in a new information act .
but , thiel of transparency international said , personal information will be excluded from disclosure .
there will also be an information ban regarding intelligence work , the foreign office or the defense ministry , he added .
on a state level , four german länder have already introduced freedom of information laws : brandenburg , berlin , north rhine-westphalia and schleswig-holstein .
the experiences there showed that citizens were not storming the authorities to get information , as many had feared .
hansjürgen garstka , berlin 's appointee for data protection and freedom of information , stressed that he and his colleagues have only seen positive results of the law .
" it is urgent that the federal government and the other states also take this path to more transparency and democracy , " garstka said .
no longer a " secretive opponent " during its first session in 1946 , the united nations general assembly adopted a resolution , which stated : " freedom of information is a fundamental human right and -lrb- … -rrb- the touchstone of all the freedoms to which the un is consecrated . "
supporters of such legislation say it is high time germany passes its own ifg .
" a freedom of information law can help the state show that it wants to be a transparent partner of its citizens and not a secretive opponent , " said gesine schwan , president of viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder and the presidential candidate of chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition who lost the election earlier this year .
the ruling factions plan to introduce the bill towards the end of 2004 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies fear everyone will know just how they budget their contracts the greens and social democrats have said they will ensure that such business secrets are protected from release .
but this is not a solution , bdi fears .
" this would mean that companies have to double-check all of their documents and mark confidential information , " hintzen told dw-world .
" it 's unnecessary additional work . "
according to edda müller , executive director of the federation of german consumer organizations , more transparency in public administration is essential for consumers .
" authorities need to show how seriously they take consumer protection and how effectively they want to protect citizens ' interests , " müller said .
" we have to finally anchor this right for information access in germany . "
bdi , which has not been given the law 's text for review , disagrees .
" examining official files is not a basic right , " said hintzen .
success on the state level the forerunner for germany 's ifg is the freedom of information act -lrb- foia -rrb- in the united states .
introduced in 1966 , the foia has become one of the most crucial instruments to journalists and other citizens for understanding events behind the scenes - and to elicit unpleasant secrets from the government .
when the pentagon recently forbid the release of photographs showing soldiers ' remains returning home from iraq , an foia request resulted in their publication .
advocates of the ifg point to such instances as proof that disclosure can be positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-green government feels every citizen should have access to federal files critics of the ifg , on the other hand , worry that germany 's very strong data protection laws could be watered down in a new information act .
but , thiel of transparency international said , personal information will be excluded from disclosure .
there will also be an information ban regarding intelligence work , the foreign office or the defense ministry , he added .
on a state level , four german länder have already introduced freedom of information laws : brandenburg , berlin , north rhine-westphalia and schleswig-holstein .
the experiences there showed that citizens were not storming the authorities to get information , as many had feared .
hansjürgen garstka , berlin 's appointee for data protection and freedom of information , stressed that he and his colleagues have only seen positive results of the law .
" it is urgent that the federal government and the other states also take this path to more transparency and democracy , " garstka said .
no longer a " secretive opponent " during its first session in 1946 , the united nations general assembly adopted a resolution , which stated : " freedom of information is a fundamental human right and -lrb- … -rrb- the touchstone of all the freedoms to which the un is consecrated . "
supporters of such legislation say it is high time germany passes its own ifg .
" a freedom of information law can help the state show that it wants to be a transparent partner of its citizens and not a secretive opponent , " said gesine schwan , president of viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder and the presidential candidate of chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition who lost the election earlier this year .
the ruling factions plan to introduce the bill towards the end of 2004 .
proponents think it will pass .
" the coalition needs a success , " said thiel .
in these times when chancellor schröder is facing widespread discontent about his welfare reforms , a success for citizen participation could be just the right thing . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is germany ?
once upon a time , germany was regarded as a country whose government officials and companies operated with fairness and competence , and whose post-war economy was founded on principles of quality and honest .
but several corruption scandals are tarnishing the country ’ s reputation .

all countries that joined the eu on may 1 .
across six out of the 10 new eu nations that provided statistics , the number of asylum requests increased an average of 26 percent in the second quarter of 2004 as compared to the january-march period of this year . this pattern is due in part to the fact that applying for asylum in ex-soviet bloc countries has simply become much easier , said unhcr spokesman rupert colville . " they had no asylum laws , no asylum system at all , before the fall of the soviet union , " he told reporters .
" that gradually got better , " he added , saying that reaching a certain procedural standard for handling asylum requests " was one of the requirements for entry in the european union . "
another factor contributing to this new influx is that many of the affected countries are the first point of entry along major axes of immigration from the far east , afghanistan and chechnya , colville said .
law could see news states overwhelmed the unhcr expressed concern that european legislation making it possible to send back asylum seekers to the first eu country in which they sought refuge could overwhelm the fledgling asylum offices in these new eu nations . " they are perhaps still less well placed to cope with a major influx than the old eu countries , " colville noted . overall , asylum requests in europe have dropped off in recent years , especially in the core eu countries with long-established traditions of political asylum .
in the 30 industrialized nations covered by the unhcr study the number of petitioners in the second quarter of 2004 was 86,600 , the lowest figure in 17 years and eight percent less than the preceding quarter .
already in 2003 , asylum requests dropped 20 percent as compared to the year before , due mainly to fewer refugees from afghanistan and iraq .
traditional refuges record drop in petitions though france registered the highest number of requests in europe for the third straight quarter , the number dropped 11 percent in the second quarter this year as compared to the same period in 2003 .
in germany the decrease was 16 percent and in britain 13 percent .
so far in 2004 , germany 's federal office for the recognition of foreign refugees has reviewed 30,566 petitions for refugee status with the main countries of origin being turkey , serbia and montenegro , and the russian federation , followed by iran and azerbaijan .
russians - presumably mainly from chechnya - remain the single largest group among countries of origin , though the number of requests dropped four percent over the corresponding period .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 -pipe- 07:00 utc dutch doubt euro pact reform will happen in 2004 dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told the economic and monetary affairs committee in the european parliament : " i am waiting for the european commission proposals , but i am not certain that we will reach an accord on reforming the -lsb- stability and growth -rsb- pact under the dutch presidency . "
zalm , who has always argued for the rules to be strictly implemented , was widely seen as a hardliner in the damaging row that took place between the commission and some member states , notably france and germany , last november .
but he said on tuesday that he wishes to avoid a repeat of this conflict - which resulted in the case being taken to the european court of justice - during the reform debate .
" what i certainly do n't want is to have again a big clash like we had in november , " he said .

1 , 1939 , german troops crossed the border into poland .
the attack caused the outbreak of world war ii - the single biggest catastrophe of the 20th century . " tonight for the first time , poland fired shots against our territory and regular soldiers .
we have been returning fire since 5:45 a.m.
and from now on , we will retaliate , bomb for bomb . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer lays down a wreath at the ' central memorial of the federal republic of germany to the victims of war and tyranny ' commemorating the beginning of the word war ii with these words on sept .
1 , 1939 , adolf hitler announced that german troops had marched into poland .
the evening before , ss soldiers disguised as poles attacked the radio station of gleiwitz , a town on the german-polish border , and transmitted a message for the polish minority in the region to take arms against the germans .
this fictitious act of aggression was to serve as an alibi for the attack on poland . hitler had long been on the warpath .
fifteen years previously , he wrote in his book " mein kampf , " that the germans should seize more lebensraum - living space .
besides , his rationale went , peace between populations was impossible .
only war could determine survival . relations with poland were already strained during the weimar republic , due to the 1919 treaty of versailles , which laid down territorial acts of transfer to poland .
the state of east prussia was separated from the german reich by a polish corridor , something barely any german politicians were prepared to accept . strategy of deception when the national socialists took power in 1933 , hitler pursued closer ties to poland for tactical reasons - he wanted to create an impression , at least to outsiders , of his readiness for peace .
in 1934 , he signed a pact of non-aggression with poland . " there may be differences between our two countries in future , but the catastrophic effects of trying to solve them through actions of war would in no way be in proportion to any possible gain , " hitler said .
" the german government was therefore pleased to find that the leader of the polish state , marshall pilsudski , shares this opinion , and that this mutual realization has been turned into a contract , that wo n't just be of equal use to the polish and german peoples , but also will contribute significantly to the preservation of peace generally . " but the truth was that peace was not on hitler 's agenda .
instead of pursuing peace , he fuelled his plans for expansion .
in 1938 , austria was annexed by the german reich , then czechoslovakia - both without any military resistance . poland 's weak position poland 's fate was sealed when , at the end of august , 1939 , hitler surprisingly negotiated a pact of non-aggression with stalin .
in a secret protocol , it was decided - poland would be divided up between germany and the soviet union .
just one week later , germany marched on poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as nazi germany starts the invasion of its neighbor poland in the early morning hours of september 1 , 1939 , these german soldiers tear down a barrier at the german-polish border , at an unknown location .
although the polish government knew of germany 's war preparations , the attack came as a surprise .
in the early morning hours of sept .
1 , the german battleship " schleswig-holstein " opened fire on the polish city of danzig .
hours later , hitler spoke in front of the reichstag assembly . " those who distance themselves from the rules of humane warfare can expect nothing else from us but that we do the same , " he said .
" and i will lead this war - no matter whom we fight - until such time that the security of the reich is guaranteed . " two days later , england and france declared war on germany .
world war ii had officially begun . ralf jäckel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

it 's german men who need to watch out for wandering eyes - only two percent of women said their partner was the best looking man around .
it 's not men 's lack of effort that 's putting women off .

the watzmann consists of three summits : the hocheck at 2,651 meters is relatively easy to climb and takes about two to three hours to complete from the watzmannhaus . the middle point or mittelspitze at 2,713 meters requires a degree of alpine climbing experience .
the south point or südspitze at 2,712 meters and the descent to the wimbachgrieshütte lodge on the other side are only suitable for the confident , very fit mountaineers with the necessary climbing equipment .

1 , 1939 , adolf hitler announced that german troops had marched into poland .
the evening before , ss soldiers disguised as poles attacked the radio station of gleiwitz , a town on the german-polish border , and transmitted a message for the polish minority in the region to take arms against the germans .
this fictitious act of aggression was to serve as an alibi for the attack on poland . hitler had long been on the warpath .
fifteen years previously , he wrote in his book " mein kampf , " that the germans should seize more lebensraum - living space .
besides , his rationale went , peace between populations was impossible .
only war could determine survival . relations with poland were already strained during the weimar republic , due to the 1919 treaty of versailles , which laid down territorial acts of transfer to poland .
the state of east prussia was separated from the german reich by a polish corridor , something barely any german politicians were prepared to accept . strategy of deception when the national socialists took power in 1933 , hitler pursued closer ties to poland for tactical reasons - he wanted to create an impression , at least to outsiders , of his readiness for peace .
in 1934 , he signed a pact of non-aggression with poland . " there may be differences between our two countries in future , but the catastrophic effects of trying to solve them through actions of war would in no way be in proportion to any possible gain , " hitler said .
" the german government was therefore pleased to find that the leader of the polish state , marshall pilsudski , shares this opinion , and that this mutual realization has been turned into a contract , that wo n't just be of equal use to the polish and german peoples , but also will contribute significantly to the preservation of peace generally . " but the truth was that peace was not on hitler 's agenda .
instead of pursuing peace , he fuelled his plans for expansion .
in 1938 , austria was annexed by the german reich , then czechoslovakia - both without any military resistance . poland 's weak position poland 's fate was sealed when , at the end of august , 1939 , hitler surprisingly negotiated a pact of non-aggression with stalin .
in a secret protocol , it was decided - poland would be divided up between germany and the soviet union .

making the adjustment can be tough , but entrepreneurs from abroad can gain as much from germany as the country does from them . ali haydar berkpinar grew up in turkey , but came to germany while he was still in school .
today he 's the director of the german branch of the turkish carmaker tofa .
he may work in frankfurt , but he 's never forgotten his roots . " in many respects i actually feel like i 'm german , " he said .
" but culturally , speaking of the mental connection , i do think of turkey . " maximilian jaber , a palestinian-jordanian businessman , similarly sees himself as wandering between two cultures .
he 's chairman of the düsseldorf-based it consultancy comcave ag .
both the governments of bahrain and the united arab emirates belong to its list of customers .
but so do the state of baden-württemberg and dortmund 's chamber of commerce . " on one hand , i think like a german .
i also see myself as a citizen of the world .
and when something is about feelings - then i 'm more the emotional arab-palestinian , " jaber said . berkpinar and jaber are two immigrants who took integration for granted long ago : if you want to purse good business you ca n't cut yourself off from german society .
currently there are roughly 60,000 entrepreneurs of turkish origin in germany - and that 's not just the owners of kebab shops and corner fruit and vegetable stores . the hamburg travel agency magnate vural öger and textile maker kemal sahin in aachen are all about big business .

their visit to the synagogue was part of an excursion package arranged by the company .
the espers contend that tui must have known of a concrete danger to tourists and hence should have warned them . out of court settlement likely tui however , has denied the charges .
tui lawyer alfred pesch argued in court wednesday that the company could not have predicted the attack , saying tunisia showed no signs of violence beforehand . judge knüllig-dingeldey said she would issue a ruling on october 27 , but would prefer an out of court settlement . pesch emphasized that if such a settlement is reached , it should not include a recognition of the company 's guilt and would only be made on humanitarian grounds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : caucasian cycle of conflict gunmen release some russian hostages militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 opinion : is chechnya russia 's palestine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 10 years of war , chechens live in desperate conditions russia has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks over the past week , the cause for which lies in chechnya .
the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .
and instead of being embezzled by corrupt civil servants , the funds should be handled transparently , and lead to a real reconstruction of chechnya .
given the high price of oil , russia has enough money , as the 28 percent rise in military expenditure for the 2005 budget shows . such steps demand strength , long-term vision and decisive action from the russian leadership .
otherwise , there is a real danger that chechnya will become the palestine of russia , and that terrorist attacks will - as in israel - become an everyday occurrence . ingo mannteufel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gunmen release some russian hostages gunmen with explosives strapped around their waists took up to 240 people hostage at a school in southern russia near war-torn chechnya wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : caucasian cycle of conflict gunmen release some russian hostages militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 opinion : is chechnya russia 's palestine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 10 years of war , chechens live in desperate conditions russia has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks over the past week , the cause for which lies in chechnya .
the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .
and instead of being embezzled by corrupt civil servants , the funds should be handled transparently , and lead to a real reconstruction of chechnya .
given the high price of oil , russia has enough money , as the 28 percent rise in military expenditure for the 2005 budget shows . such steps demand strength , long-term vision and decisive action from the russian leadership .
otherwise , there is a real danger that chechnya will become the palestine of russia , and that terrorist attacks will - as in israel - become an everyday occurrence . ingo mannteufel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gunmen release some russian hostages gunmen with explosives strapped around their waists took up to 240 people hostage at a school in southern russia near war-torn chechnya wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2004 germany 's intercultural business climate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the turkish-german business chamber in april foreigners starting up businesses in germany need to be prepared to bridge a cultural divide .
making the adjustment can be tough , but entrepreneurs from abroad can gain as much from germany as the country does from them . ali haydar berkpinar grew up in turkey , but came to germany while he was still in school .
today he 's the director of the german branch of the turkish carmaker tofa .
he may work in frankfurt , but he 's never forgotten his roots . " in many respects i actually feel like i 'm german , " he said .
" but culturally , speaking of the mental connection , i do think of turkey . " maximilian jaber , a palestinian-jordanian businessman , similarly sees himself as wandering between two cultures .
he 's chairman of the düsseldorf-based it consultancy comcave ag .
both the governments of bahrain and the united arab emirates belong to its list of customers .
but so do the state of baden-württemberg and dortmund 's chamber of commerce . " on one hand , i think like a german .
i also see myself as a citizen of the world .
and when something is about feelings - then i 'm more the emotional arab-palestinian , " jaber said . berkpinar and jaber are two immigrants who took integration for granted long ago : if you want to purse good business you ca n't cut yourself off from german society .
currently there are roughly 60,000 entrepreneurs of turkish origin in germany - and that 's not just the owners of kebab shops and corner fruit and vegetable stores . the hamburg travel agency magnate vural öger and textile maker kemal sahin in aachen are all about big business .
turkish bosses in germany are responsible for around € 30 billion in annual turnover .
they are crucially important taxpayers , creating jobs for more than 350,000 employees . the advantage of a mixed identity " what i first see as a german is reliability and punctuality , " said berkinpar .
" but flexibility of service is more of a turkish trait . " jaber also pointed out differences in mentality , saying his own multicultural identity - an arab business man with a base in germany - is often seen as an advantage .
" i think more globally and try to bring in cultural differences with what i 'm doing .
you become a bit more sensitive in that respect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there a many organizations set up to help entrepreneurs like jaber and berkpinar , such as the arab-german commerce association -lrb- ghorfa -rrb- in berlin and the newly founded turkish-german chamber of industry and commerce in cologne .
that helps cover business issues , but what about cultural difficulties ? conservative muslims often complain that they are not given time to pray during the day while working for german companies .
berkpinar is himself muslim , but orthodox employees do n't have an easier time working for him .
" generally speaking , german employees do n't pray at work either , " he said .
" if they have the need to pray they go to the church during their freetime .
it has no place on the job . " jaber views the matter differently .
he believes a modern and global firm should accommodate the religious needs of the workforce .
however , he also qualifies his support .
" companies in germany are already fighting with enough other problems , " he said .
" so you do n't necessarily need to set up a separate room for praying .
but i think the employees should be able to find a space at the company and use that for a prayer room .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : caucasian cycle of conflict gunmen release some russian hostages militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 opinion : is chechnya russia 's palestine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 10 years of war , chechens live in desperate conditions russia has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks over the past week , the cause for which lies in chechnya .
the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .
and instead of being embezzled by corrupt civil servants , the funds should be handled transparently , and lead to a real reconstruction of chechnya .
given the high price of oil , russia has enough money , as the 28 percent rise in military expenditure for the 2005 budget shows . such steps demand strength , long-term vision and decisive action from the russian leadership .
otherwise , there is a real danger that chechnya will become the palestine of russia , and that terrorist attacks will - as in israel - become an everyday occurrence . ingo mannteufel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gunmen release some russian hostages gunmen with explosives strapped around their waists took up to 240 people hostage at a school in southern russia near war-torn chechnya wednesday .

their visit to the synagogue was part of an excursion package arranged by the company .
the espers contend that tui must have known of a concrete danger to tourists and hence should have warned them . out of court settlement likely tui however , has denied the charges .
tui lawyer alfred pesch argued in court wednesday that the company could not have predicted the attack , saying tunisia showed no signs of violence beforehand . judge knüllig-dingeldey said she would issue a ruling on october 27 , but would prefer an out of court settlement . pesch emphasized that if such a settlement is reached , it should not include a recognition of the company 's guilt and would only be made on humanitarian grounds .

making the adjustment can be tough , but entrepreneurs from abroad can gain as much from germany as the country does from them . ali haydar berkpinar grew up in turkey , but came to germany while he was still in school .
today he 's the director of the german branch of the turkish carmaker tofa .
he may work in frankfurt , but he 's never forgotten his roots . " in many respects i actually feel like i 'm german , " he said .
" but culturally , speaking of the mental connection , i do think of turkey . " maximilian jaber , a palestinian-jordanian businessman , similarly sees himself as wandering between two cultures .
he 's chairman of the düsseldorf-based it consultancy comcave ag .
both the governments of bahrain and the united arab emirates belong to its list of customers .
but so do the state of baden-württemberg and dortmund 's chamber of commerce . " on one hand , i think like a german .
i also see myself as a citizen of the world .
and when something is about feelings - then i 'm more the emotional arab-palestinian , " jaber said . berkpinar and jaber are two immigrants who took integration for granted long ago : if you want to purse good business you ca n't cut yourself off from german society .
currently there are roughly 60,000 entrepreneurs of turkish origin in germany - and that 's not just the owners of kebab shops and corner fruit and vegetable stores . the hamburg travel agency magnate vural öger and textile maker kemal sahin in aachen are all about big business .
turkish bosses in germany are responsible for around € 30 billion in annual turnover .
they are crucially important taxpayers , creating jobs for more than 350,000 employees . the advantage of a mixed identity " what i first see as a german is reliability and punctuality , " said berkinpar .
" but flexibility of service is more of a turkish trait . " jaber also pointed out differences in mentality , saying his own multicultural identity - an arab business man with a base in germany - is often seen as an advantage .
" i think more globally and try to bring in cultural differences with what i 'm doing .
you become a bit more sensitive in that respect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there a many organizations set up to help entrepreneurs like jaber and berkpinar , such as the arab-german commerce association -lrb- ghorfa -rrb- in berlin and the newly founded turkish-german chamber of industry and commerce in cologne .
that helps cover business issues , but what about cultural difficulties ? conservative muslims often complain that they are not given time to pray during the day while working for german companies .
berkpinar is himself muslim , but orthodox employees do n't have an easier time working for him .
" generally speaking , german employees do n't pray at work either , " he said .
" if they have the need to pray they go to the church during their freetime .
it has no place on the job . " jaber views the matter differently .
he believes a modern and global firm should accommodate the religious needs of the workforce .
however , he also qualifies his support .
" companies in germany are already fighting with enough other problems , " he said .
" so you do n't necessarily need to set up a separate room for praying .
but i think the employees should be able to find a space at the company and use that for a prayer room .

the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .
and instead of being embezzled by corrupt civil servants , the funds should be handled transparently , and lead to a real reconstruction of chechnya .
given the high price of oil , russia has enough money , as the 28 percent rise in military expenditure for the 2005 budget shows . such steps demand strength , long-term vision and decisive action from the russian leadership .

currently there are roughly 60,000 entrepreneurs of turkish origin in germany - and that 's not just the owners of kebab shops and corner fruit and vegetable stores . the hamburg travel agency magnate vural öger and textile maker kemal sahin in aachen are all about big business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : caucasian cycle of conflict gunmen release some russian hostages militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 opinion : is chechnya russia 's palestine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 10 years of war , chechens live in desperate conditions russia has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks over the past week , the cause for which lies in chechnya .
the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .
and instead of being embezzled by corrupt civil servants , the funds should be handled transparently , and lead to a real reconstruction of chechnya .
given the high price of oil , russia has enough money , as the 28 percent rise in military expenditure for the 2005 budget shows . such steps demand strength , long-term vision and decisive action from the russian leadership .
otherwise , there is a real danger that chechnya will become the palestine of russia , and that terrorist attacks will - as in israel - become an everyday occurrence . ingo mannteufel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gunmen release some russian hostages gunmen with explosives strapped around their waists took up to 240 people hostage at a school in southern russia near war-torn chechnya wednesday .

"
a new magazine study asked 1,001 germans to rate their own attractiveness as well as that of their countrymen .
it found westerners called themselves alluring more often than people in the east . just over 14 percent of german men think their partner is the most attractive woman in the country according to a study by the forsa research institute for stern magazine .

still , it 's no reason to fret , you 've still come out ahead of claudia schiffer , who got 10 percent , and verona feldbusch 's three percent .
it 's german men who need to watch out for wandering eyes - only two percent of women said their partner was the best looking man around .
it 's not men 's lack of effort that 's putting women off .
while 90 percent of both sexes agreed taking care of your teeth is important , the study showed men regularly take part in sports and go to the hair-dresser more often than women .
east-west divide the study also showed another beauty trend .
western germans rate themselves attractive more often than their countrymen in eastern germany . answering the question of whether their appearance has ever helped them , 62 percent of people from western germany answered yes , a sentiment felt by 48 percent of people in the former east german states .
in fact , 12.5 percent of eastern germans said their looks actually hurt them , just under six percent of westerners thought so . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sun , sea and a new nose germans are finding a little bit of vacation - and plastic surgery - can work wonders for their looks .

the parents argue tui failed to properly warn them of the terror threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community inspect damage in the djerba synagogue .
adrian esper , now aged five , suffered burns on 40 percent of his body during the april 11 , 2002 , blast when a tanker truck filled with cooking gas was crashed into a historic synagogue on the popular vacation island of djerba .
the explosion killed 14 germans , two french nationals and five tunisians , including the suspected bomber . since then adrian has been in and out of the hospital and continues to suffer from grave injuries . the esper family had booked their vacation through 1-2 fly , which belongs to tui .
their visit to the synagogue was part of an excursion package arranged by the company .
the espers contend that tui must have known of a concrete danger to tourists and hence should have warned them . out of court settlement likely tui however , has denied the charges .
tui lawyer alfred pesch argued in court wednesday that the company could not have predicted the attack , saying tunisia showed no signs of violence beforehand . judge knüllig-dingeldey said she would issue a ruling on october 27 , but would prefer an out of court settlement . pesch emphasized that if such a settlement is reached , it should not include a recognition of the company 's guilt and would only be made on humanitarian grounds .
" one can always imagine a compensation , " he said .
the lawyer also demanded that a fundamental legal clarification was necessary for germany 's travel companies . last year , german and tunisian interior ministers , meeting just ahead of the anniversary of the attack , signed an agreement to combat terrorism and other crimes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french allege detained german is top al qaeda leader french officials on wednesday accused a german citizen of being a leading member of the al qaeda terrorist network with ties to osama bin laden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : caucasian cycle of conflict gunmen release some russian hostages militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 opinion : is chechnya russia 's palestine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 10 years of war , chechens live in desperate conditions russia has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks over the past week , the cause for which lies in chechnya .
the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .
and instead of being embezzled by corrupt civil servants , the funds should be handled transparently , and lead to a real reconstruction of chechnya .
given the high price of oil , russia has enough money , as the 28 percent rise in military expenditure for the 2005 budget shows . such steps demand strength , long-term vision and decisive action from the russian leadership .
otherwise , there is a real danger that chechnya will become the palestine of russia , and that terrorist attacks will - as in israel - become an everyday occurrence . ingo mannteufel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gunmen release some russian hostages gunmen with explosives strapped around their waists took up to 240 people hostage at a school in southern russia near war-torn chechnya wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.09.2004 germany 's intercultural business climate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the turkish-german business chamber in april foreigners starting up businesses in germany need to be prepared to bridge a cultural divide .
making the adjustment can be tough , but entrepreneurs from abroad can gain as much from germany as the country does from them . ali haydar berkpinar grew up in turkey , but came to germany while he was still in school .
today he 's the director of the german branch of the turkish carmaker tofa .
he may work in frankfurt , but he 's never forgotten his roots . " in many respects i actually feel like i 'm german , " he said .
" but culturally , speaking of the mental connection , i do think of turkey . " maximilian jaber , a palestinian-jordanian businessman , similarly sees himself as wandering between two cultures .
he 's chairman of the düsseldorf-based it consultancy comcave ag .
both the governments of bahrain and the united arab emirates belong to its list of customers .
but so do the state of baden-württemberg and dortmund 's chamber of commerce . " on one hand , i think like a german .
i also see myself as a citizen of the world .
and when something is about feelings - then i 'm more the emotional arab-palestinian , " jaber said . berkpinar and jaber are two immigrants who took integration for granted long ago : if you want to purse good business you ca n't cut yourself off from german society .
currently there are roughly 60,000 entrepreneurs of turkish origin in germany - and that 's not just the owners of kebab shops and corner fruit and vegetable stores . the hamburg travel agency magnate vural öger and textile maker kemal sahin in aachen are all about big business .
turkish bosses in germany are responsible for around € 30 billion in annual turnover .
they are crucially important taxpayers , creating jobs for more than 350,000 employees . the advantage of a mixed identity " what i first see as a german is reliability and punctuality , " said berkinpar .
" but flexibility of service is more of a turkish trait . " jaber also pointed out differences in mentality , saying his own multicultural identity - an arab business man with a base in germany - is often seen as an advantage .
" i think more globally and try to bring in cultural differences with what i 'm doing .
you become a bit more sensitive in that respect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there a many organizations set up to help entrepreneurs like jaber and berkpinar , such as the arab-german commerce association -lrb- ghorfa -rrb- in berlin and the newly founded turkish-german chamber of industry and commerce in cologne .
that helps cover business issues , but what about cultural difficulties ? conservative muslims often complain that they are not given time to pray during the day while working for german companies .
berkpinar is himself muslim , but orthodox employees do n't have an easier time working for him .
" generally speaking , german employees do n't pray at work either , " he said .
" if they have the need to pray they go to the church during their freetime .
it has no place on the job . " jaber views the matter differently .
he believes a modern and global firm should accommodate the religious needs of the workforce .
however , he also qualifies his support .
" companies in germany are already fighting with enough other problems , " he said .
" so you do n't necessarily need to set up a separate room for praying .
but i think the employees should be able to find a space at the company and use that for a prayer room .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermodel heidi klum topped german men 's most attractive list sorry ladies , but heidi klum -lrb- photo -rrb- beat you to the top of the list with 18 percent of the vote .
still , it 's no reason to fret , you 've still come out ahead of claudia schiffer , who got 10 percent , and verona feldbusch 's three percent .
it 's german men who need to watch out for wandering eyes - only two percent of women said their partner was the best looking man around .
it 's not men 's lack of effort that 's putting women off .
while 90 percent of both sexes agreed taking care of your teeth is important , the study showed men regularly take part in sports and go to the hair-dresser more often than women .
east-west divide the study also showed another beauty trend .
western germans rate themselves attractive more often than their countrymen in eastern germany . answering the question of whether their appearance has ever helped them , 62 percent of people from western germany answered yes , a sentiment felt by 48 percent of people in the former east german states .
in fact , 12.5 percent of eastern germans said their looks actually hurt them , just under six percent of westerners thought so . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sun , sea and a new nose germans are finding a little bit of vacation - and plastic surgery - can work wonders for their looks .

although shadowed by the zugspitze , the second highest peak in germany still attracts crowds of climbers eager to conquer its summit and view the alpine lake below . even though it lacks the prestige of being the highest peak in germany , the watzmann still attracts crowds of mountaineers every year , all eager to conquer the second highest summit in the country . some mountaineers return time and time again to climb the mountain while others take their satisfaction from just one ascent .
even though at 2,713 meters it is dwarfed by the zugspitze , which at 2,962 meters has more to offer , reaching the top of the watzmann is something really quite special . set in bavaria 's berchtesgadener land national park which surrounds the königssee alpine lake , the watzmann offers a great climbing experience in an area well known as the pearl of the german alpine region .
the challenge is one that mountaineers must attempt completely on foot .

the watzmann consists of three summits : the hocheck at 2,651 meters is relatively easy to climb and takes about two to three hours to complete from the watzmannhaus . the middle point or mittelspitze at 2,713 meters requires a degree of alpine climbing experience .
the south point or südspitze at 2,712 meters and the descent to the wimbachgrieshütte lodge on the other side are only suitable for the confident , very fit mountaineers with the necessary climbing equipment .
the guides who lead the tours know what is required for each peak and are on hand to offer advice . most visitors attempt the hocheck summit and the mittelspitze .
from there , the return journey takes you back to the watzmannhaus which once again offers a welcome resting point before heading back down to the valley below . once back in the valley , those who are still fit and eager have the choice of a number of tours around the königssee which also offers overnight accommodation in huts around the crystal-clear lake . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 turkey changes laws to meet eu standards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms are meant to bring turkey on track for eu membership talks the turkish government agreed on 348 new paragraphs to brings it 80-year-old penal code , which punished sheep theft harder than assault , up to european standard .
extending women 's rights was especially controversial . the turkish government wants to implement the changes , which the opposition party said it will not challenge , quickly - ideally before an october decision by the european commission on whether the eu should begin accession talks with ankara .
the reforms are turkey 's latest batch of legal adjustments , made to boost the country 's chances for eu membership .
in the past two years , turkey passed laws that increased freedom of speech and reduced the role of the military .
" the old laws were focused on the state .
they limited citizens ' freedom to protect the state , " hakki köyklü of the ruling justice and development party said .
" now we 're putting the people in the center . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians want to put a stop to torture in police stations that means torture in police stations and prisons will be punished with 12 years in jail .
sending children to beg in the streets will also receive harsher punishment , as will child abuse .
genocide , crimes against humanity and people trafficking will also make their first appearances in the turkish penal code .
women 's rights improved but it was sexual crimes that politicians devoted most of their attention to - both in ankara and in brussels .
with pressure from the eu , women 's rights groups were able to outlaw rape in marriages and get old-fashioned terms like " chastity , " " honor " and " moral " out of criminal law books .

extending women 's rights was especially controversial . the turkish government wants to implement the changes , which the opposition party said it will not challenge , quickly - ideally before an october decision by the european commission on whether the eu should begin accession talks with ankara .
the reforms are turkey 's latest batch of legal adjustments , made to boost the country 's chances for eu membership .
in the past two years , turkey passed laws that increased freedom of speech and reduced the role of the military .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 turkey changes laws to meet eu standards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms are meant to bring turkey on track for eu membership talks the turkish government agreed on 348 new paragraphs to brings it 80-year-old penal code , which punished sheep theft harder than assault , up to european standard .
extending women 's rights was especially controversial . the turkish government wants to implement the changes , which the opposition party said it will not challenge , quickly - ideally before an october decision by the european commission on whether the eu should begin accession talks with ankara .
the reforms are turkey 's latest batch of legal adjustments , made to boost the country 's chances for eu membership .
in the past two years , turkey passed laws that increased freedom of speech and reduced the role of the military .
" the old laws were focused on the state .
they limited citizens ' freedom to protect the state , " hakki köyklü of the ruling justice and development party said .
" now we 're putting the people in the center . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians want to put a stop to torture in police stations that means torture in police stations and prisons will be punished with 12 years in jail .
sending children to beg in the streets will also receive harsher punishment , as will child abuse .
genocide , crimes against humanity and people trafficking will also make their first appearances in the turkish penal code .
women 's rights improved but it was sexual crimes that politicians devoted most of their attention to - both in ankara and in brussels .
with pressure from the eu , women 's rights groups were able to outlaw rape in marriages and get old-fashioned terms like " chastity , " " honor " and " moral " out of criminal law books .
forced virginity tests were struck from the books as have the sentence reductions for rapists who marry their victims and fathers who murder their " impure " daughters in so-called honor killings .
but one old moral custom managed to push its way back in to law .
justice minister cemil cicek said there were " social reasons " for making adultery illegal again , after it was struck from the statute book eight years ago .
" this is really not progressive , " said sükrem eroglu , member of istanbul 's bar association .
" it 's a fully behind-the-times mentality . "
though joined by a few women 's groups , eroglu did n't have much company in his criticism - the public , for the most part , remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though allowed in public , headscarves in schools are still illegal the adultery ban is one of the few points the conservative parties can give to their voters .
they lost in their fight to lift the taboo on headscarves in turkish schools and universities .
no promises from eu while commending the progress ankara has made in the last two years , eu officials still are n't making any promises .
an august report by dutch advisory council on international affairs recommended beginning accession talks with turkey within the next two years , but warned the eu about setting a specific accession date , until the actual effects of the reforms can be seen .
" now we 're going to work together to get all of this finished before october , " justice minister cicek said .
" the rest is just details and tabloid news . " jörg pfuhl -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talks with turkey next on eu agenda outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey .

in 1934 , he signed a pact of non-aggression with poland . " there may be differences between our two countries in future , but the catastrophic effects of trying to solve them through actions of war would in no way be in proportion to any possible gain , " hitler said .
" the german government was therefore pleased to find that the leader of the polish state , marshall pilsudski , shares this opinion , and that this mutual realization has been turned into a contract , that wo n't just be of equal use to the polish and german peoples , but also will contribute significantly to the preservation of peace generally .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer lays down a wreath at the ' central memorial of the federal republic of germany to the victims of war and tyranny ' commemorating the beginning of the word war ii with these words on sept .
1 , 1939 , adolf hitler announced that german troops had marched into poland .
the evening before , ss soldiers disguised as poles attacked the radio station of gleiwitz , a town on the german-polish border , and transmitted a message for the polish minority in the region to take arms against the germans .
this fictitious act of aggression was to serve as an alibi for the attack on poland . hitler had long been on the warpath .
fifteen years previously , he wrote in his book " mein kampf , " that the germans should seize more lebensraum - living space .
besides , his rationale went , peace between populations was impossible .
only war could determine survival . relations with poland were already strained during the weimar republic , due to the 1919 treaty of versailles , which laid down territorial acts of transfer to poland .
the state of east prussia was separated from the german reich by a polish corridor , something barely any german politicians were prepared to accept . strategy of deception when the national socialists took power in 1933 , hitler pursued closer ties to poland for tactical reasons - he wanted to create an impression , at least to outsiders , of his readiness for peace .
in 1934 , he signed a pact of non-aggression with poland . " there may be differences between our two countries in future , but the catastrophic effects of trying to solve them through actions of war would in no way be in proportion to any possible gain , " hitler said .
" the german government was therefore pleased to find that the leader of the polish state , marshall pilsudski , shares this opinion , and that this mutual realization has been turned into a contract , that wo n't just be of equal use to the polish and german peoples , but also will contribute significantly to the preservation of peace generally . " but the truth was that peace was not on hitler 's agenda .
instead of pursuing peace , he fuelled his plans for expansion .
in 1938 , austria was annexed by the german reich , then czechoslovakia - both without any military resistance . poland 's weak position poland 's fate was sealed when , at the end of august , 1939 , hitler surprisingly negotiated a pact of non-aggression with stalin .
in a secret protocol , it was decided - poland would be divided up between germany and the soviet union .
just one week later , germany marched on poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as nazi germany starts the invasion of its neighbor poland in the early morning hours of september 1 , 1939 , these german soldiers tear down a barrier at the german-polish border , at an unknown location .
although the polish government knew of germany 's war preparations , the attack came as a surprise .
in the early morning hours of sept .
1 , the german battleship " schleswig-holstein " opened fire on the polish city of danzig .
hours later , hitler spoke in front of the reichstag assembly . " those who distance themselves from the rules of humane warfare can expect nothing else from us but that we do the same , " he said .
" and i will lead this war - no matter whom we fight - until such time that the security of the reich is guaranteed . " two days later , england and france declared war on germany .

making the adjustment can be tough , but entrepreneurs from abroad can gain as much from germany as the country does from them . ali haydar berkpinar grew up in turkey , but came to germany while he was still in school .

but so do the state of baden-württemberg and dortmund 's chamber of commerce . " on one hand , i think like a german .
i also see myself as a citizen of the world .
and when something is about feelings - then i 'm more the emotional arab-palestinian , " jaber said . berkpinar and jaber are two immigrants who took integration for granted long ago : if you want to purse good business you ca n't cut yourself off from german society .
currently there are roughly 60,000 entrepreneurs of turkish origin in germany - and that 's not just the owners of kebab shops and corner fruit and vegetable stores . the hamburg travel agency magnate vural öger and textile maker kemal sahin in aachen are all about big business .

they are crucially important taxpayers , creating jobs for more than 350,000 employees . the advantage of a mixed identity " what i first see as a german is reliability and punctuality , " said berkinpar .
" but flexibility of service is more of a turkish trait . " jaber also pointed out differences in mentality , saying his own multicultural identity - an arab business man with a base in germany - is often seen as an advantage .

that helps cover business issues , but what about cultural difficulties ? conservative muslims often complain that they are not given time to pray during the day while working for german companies .
berkpinar is himself muslim , but orthodox employees do n't have an easier time working for him .
" generally speaking , german employees do n't pray at work either , " he said .
" if they have the need to pray they go to the church during their freetime .
it has no place on the job . " jaber views the matter differently .
he believes a modern and global firm should accommodate the religious needs of the workforce .
however , he also qualifies his support .
" companies in germany are already fighting with enough other problems , " he said .
" so you do n't necessarily need to set up a separate room for praying .

1 , 1939 , german troops crossed the border into poland .
the attack caused the outbreak of world war ii - the single biggest catastrophe of the 20th century . " tonight for the first time , poland fired shots against our territory and regular soldiers .
we have been returning fire since 5:45 a.m.
and from now on , we will retaliate , bomb for bomb . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer lays down a wreath at the ' central memorial of the federal republic of germany to the victims of war and tyranny ' commemorating the beginning of the word war ii with these words on sept .
1 , 1939 , adolf hitler announced that german troops had marched into poland .
the evening before , ss soldiers disguised as poles attacked the radio station of gleiwitz , a town on the german-polish border , and transmitted a message for the polish minority in the region to take arms against the germans .
this fictitious act of aggression was to serve as an alibi for the attack on poland . hitler had long been on the warpath .
fifteen years previously , he wrote in his book " mein kampf , " that the germans should seize more lebensraum - living space .
besides , his rationale went , peace between populations was impossible .
only war could determine survival . relations with poland were already strained during the weimar republic , due to the 1919 treaty of versailles , which laid down territorial acts of transfer to poland .
the state of east prussia was separated from the german reich by a polish corridor , something barely any german politicians were prepared to accept . strategy of deception when the national socialists took power in 1933 , hitler pursued closer ties to poland for tactical reasons - he wanted to create an impression , at least to outsiders , of his readiness for peace .
in 1934 , he signed a pact of non-aggression with poland . " there may be differences between our two countries in future , but the catastrophic effects of trying to solve them through actions of war would in no way be in proportion to any possible gain , " hitler said .
" the german government was therefore pleased to find that the leader of the polish state , marshall pilsudski , shares this opinion , and that this mutual realization has been turned into a contract , that wo n't just be of equal use to the polish and german peoples , but also will contribute significantly to the preservation of peace generally . " but the truth was that peace was not on hitler 's agenda .
instead of pursuing peace , he fuelled his plans for expansion .
in 1938 , austria was annexed by the german reich , then czechoslovakia - both without any military resistance . poland 's weak position poland 's fate was sealed when , at the end of august , 1939 , hitler surprisingly negotiated a pact of non-aggression with stalin .
in a secret protocol , it was decided - poland would be divided up between germany and the soviet union .
just one week later , germany marched on poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as nazi germany starts the invasion of its neighbor poland in the early morning hours of september 1 , 1939 , these german soldiers tear down a barrier at the german-polish border , at an unknown location .
although the polish government knew of germany 's war preparations , the attack came as a surprise .
in the early morning hours of sept .
1 , the german battleship " schleswig-holstein " opened fire on the polish city of danzig .
hours later , hitler spoke in front of the reichstag assembly . " those who distance themselves from the rules of humane warfare can expect nothing else from us but that we do the same , " he said .
" and i will lead this war - no matter whom we fight - until such time that the security of the reich is guaranteed . " two days later , england and france declared war on germany .
world war ii had officially begun . ralf jäckel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : caucasian cycle of conflict gunmen release some russian hostages militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 opinion : is chechnya russia 's palestine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 10 years of war , chechens live in desperate conditions russia has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks over the past week , the cause for which lies in chechnya .
the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .
and instead of being embezzled by corrupt civil servants , the funds should be handled transparently , and lead to a real reconstruction of chechnya .
given the high price of oil , russia has enough money , as the 28 percent rise in military expenditure for the 2005 budget shows . such steps demand strength , long-term vision and decisive action from the russian leadership .
otherwise , there is a real danger that chechnya will become the palestine of russia , and that terrorist attacks will - as in israel - become an everyday occurrence . ingo mannteufel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gunmen release some russian hostages gunmen with explosives strapped around their waists took up to 240 people hostage at a school in southern russia near war-torn chechnya wednesday .

the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .
and instead of being embezzled by corrupt civil servants , the funds should be handled transparently , and lead to a real reconstruction of chechnya .
given the high price of oil , russia has enough money , as the 28 percent rise in military expenditure for the 2005 budget shows . such steps demand strength , long-term vision and decisive action from the russian leadership .

1 , 1939 , german troops crossed the border into poland .
the attack caused the outbreak of world war ii - the single biggest catastrophe of the 20th century . " tonight for the first time , poland fired shots against our territory and regular soldiers .
we have been returning fire since 5:45 a.m.
and from now on , we will retaliate , bomb for bomb . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer lays down a wreath at the ' central memorial of the federal republic of germany to the victims of war and tyranny ' commemorating the beginning of the word war ii with these words on sept .
1 , 1939 , adolf hitler announced that german troops had marched into poland .
the evening before , ss soldiers disguised as poles attacked the radio station of gleiwitz , a town on the german-polish border , and transmitted a message for the polish minority in the region to take arms against the germans .
this fictitious act of aggression was to serve as an alibi for the attack on poland . hitler had long been on the warpath .
fifteen years previously , he wrote in his book " mein kampf , " that the germans should seize more lebensraum - living space .
besides , his rationale went , peace between populations was impossible .
only war could determine survival . relations with poland were already strained during the weimar republic , due to the 1919 treaty of versailles , which laid down territorial acts of transfer to poland .
the state of east prussia was separated from the german reich by a polish corridor , something barely any german politicians were prepared to accept . strategy of deception when the national socialists took power in 1933 , hitler pursued closer ties to poland for tactical reasons - he wanted to create an impression , at least to outsiders , of his readiness for peace .
in 1934 , he signed a pact of non-aggression with poland . " there may be differences between our two countries in future , but the catastrophic effects of trying to solve them through actions of war would in no way be in proportion to any possible gain , " hitler said .
" the german government was therefore pleased to find that the leader of the polish state , marshall pilsudski , shares this opinion , and that this mutual realization has been turned into a contract , that wo n't just be of equal use to the polish and german peoples , but also will contribute significantly to the preservation of peace generally . " but the truth was that peace was not on hitler 's agenda .
instead of pursuing peace , he fuelled his plans for expansion .
in 1938 , austria was annexed by the german reich , then czechoslovakia - both without any military resistance . poland 's weak position poland 's fate was sealed when , at the end of august , 1939 , hitler surprisingly negotiated a pact of non-aggression with stalin .
in a secret protocol , it was decided - poland would be divided up between germany and the soviet union .
just one week later , germany marched on poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as nazi germany starts the invasion of its neighbor poland in the early morning hours of september 1 , 1939 , these german soldiers tear down a barrier at the german-polish border , at an unknown location .
although the polish government knew of germany 's war preparations , the attack came as a surprise .
in the early morning hours of sept .
1 , the german battleship " schleswig-holstein " opened fire on the polish city of danzig .
hours later , hitler spoke in front of the reichstag assembly . " those who distance themselves from the rules of humane warfare can expect nothing else from us but that we do the same , " he said .
" and i will lead this war - no matter whom we fight - until such time that the security of the reich is guaranteed . " two days later , england and france declared war on germany .
world war ii had officially begun . ralf jäckel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german leader rejects restitution claims speaking at an event in warsaw to commemorate the 1944 uprising against the nazis , chancellor gerhard schröder made clear that his government did not endorse german claims for the return of ancestral property in poland .

extending women 's rights was especially controversial . the turkish government wants to implement the changes , which the opposition party said it will not challenge , quickly - ideally before an october decision by the european commission on whether the eu should begin accession talks with ankara .
the reforms are turkey 's latest batch of legal adjustments , made to boost the country 's chances for eu membership .
in the past two years , turkey passed laws that increased freedom of speech and reduced the role of the military .
" the old laws were focused on the state .
they limited citizens ' freedom to protect the state , " hakki köyklü of the ruling justice and development party said .

genocide , crimes against humanity and people trafficking will also make their first appearances in the turkish penal code .
women 's rights improved but it was sexual crimes that politicians devoted most of their attention to - both in ankara and in brussels .
with pressure from the eu , women 's rights groups were able to outlaw rape in marriages and get old-fashioned terms like " chastity , " " honor " and " moral " out of criminal law books .
forced virginity tests were struck from the books as have the sentence reductions for rapists who marry their victims and fathers who murder their " impure " daughters in so-called honor killings .

justice minister cemil cicek said there were " social reasons " for making adultery illegal again , after it was struck from the statute book eight years ago .
" this is really not progressive , " said sükrem eroglu , member of istanbul 's bar association .
" it 's a fully behind-the-times mentality . "
though joined by a few women 's groups , eroglu did n't have much company in his criticism - the public , for the most part , remained silent on the issue .

extending women 's rights was especially controversial . the turkish government wants to implement the changes , which the opposition party said it will not challenge , quickly - ideally before an october decision by the european commission on whether the eu should begin accession talks with ankara .
the reforms are turkey 's latest batch of legal adjustments , made to boost the country 's chances for eu membership .
in the past two years , turkey passed laws that increased freedom of speech and reduced the role of the military .

women 's rights improved but it was sexual crimes that politicians devoted most of their attention to - both in ankara and in brussels .
with pressure from the eu , women 's rights groups were able to outlaw rape in marriages and get old-fashioned terms like " chastity , " " honor " and " moral " out of criminal law books .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 turkey changes laws to meet eu standards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms are meant to bring turkey on track for eu membership talks the turkish government agreed on 348 new paragraphs to brings it 80-year-old penal code , which punished sheep theft harder than assault , up to european standard .
extending women 's rights was especially controversial . the turkish government wants to implement the changes , which the opposition party said it will not challenge , quickly - ideally before an october decision by the european commission on whether the eu should begin accession talks with ankara .
the reforms are turkey 's latest batch of legal adjustments , made to boost the country 's chances for eu membership .
in the past two years , turkey passed laws that increased freedom of speech and reduced the role of the military .
" the old laws were focused on the state .
they limited citizens ' freedom to protect the state , " hakki köyklü of the ruling justice and development party said .
" now we 're putting the people in the center . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians want to put a stop to torture in police stations that means torture in police stations and prisons will be punished with 12 years in jail .
sending children to beg in the streets will also receive harsher punishment , as will child abuse .
genocide , crimes against humanity and people trafficking will also make their first appearances in the turkish penal code .
women 's rights improved but it was sexual crimes that politicians devoted most of their attention to - both in ankara and in brussels .
with pressure from the eu , women 's rights groups were able to outlaw rape in marriages and get old-fashioned terms like " chastity , " " honor " and " moral " out of criminal law books .
forced virginity tests were struck from the books as have the sentence reductions for rapists who marry their victims and fathers who murder their " impure " daughters in so-called honor killings .
but one old moral custom managed to push its way back in to law .
justice minister cemil cicek said there were " social reasons " for making adultery illegal again , after it was struck from the statute book eight years ago .
" this is really not progressive , " said sükrem eroglu , member of istanbul 's bar association .
" it 's a fully behind-the-times mentality . "
though joined by a few women 's groups , eroglu did n't have much company in his criticism - the public , for the most part , remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though allowed in public , headscarves in schools are still illegal the adultery ban is one of the few points the conservative parties can give to their voters .
they lost in their fight to lift the taboo on headscarves in turkish schools and universities .
no promises from eu while commending the progress ankara has made in the last two years , eu officials still are n't making any promises .
an august report by dutch advisory council on international affairs recommended beginning accession talks with turkey within the next two years , but warned the eu about setting a specific accession date , until the actual effects of the reforms can be seen .
" now we 're going to work together to get all of this finished before october , " justice minister cicek said .
" the rest is just details and tabloid news . " jörg pfuhl -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talks with turkey next on eu agenda outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey .

even though at 2,713 meters it is dwarfed by the zugspitze , which at 2,962 meters has more to offer , reaching the top of the watzmann is something really quite special . set in bavaria 's berchtesgadener land national park which surrounds the königssee alpine lake , the watzmann offers a great climbing experience in an area well known as the pearl of the german alpine region .
the challenge is one that mountaineers must attempt completely on foot .

although shadowed by the zugspitze , the second highest peak in germany still attracts crowds of climbers eager to conquer its summit and view the alpine lake below . even though it lacks the prestige of being the highest peak in germany , the watzmann still attracts crowds of mountaineers every year , all eager to conquer the second highest summit in the country . some mountaineers return time and time again to climb the mountain while others take their satisfaction from just one ascent .
even though at 2,713 meters it is dwarfed by the zugspitze , which at 2,962 meters has more to offer , reaching the top of the watzmann is something really quite special . set in bavaria 's berchtesgadener land national park which surrounds the königssee alpine lake , the watzmann offers a great climbing experience in an area well known as the pearl of the german alpine region .
the challenge is one that mountaineers must attempt completely on foot .
ulike the zugspitze , there is no cable car to the peak . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no trip up the watzmann would be complete without a stop at the legendary watzmannhaus .
located 2,000 meters from the base of the most demanding incline on the mountain , the 100-year-old mountaineers ' refuge provides welcome shelter for a brief stop or an overnight stay either on the way up or way down .
whatever direction you are taking , the view from the terrace is breath-taking with a clear view before you and mountains on either side . tours for every ambition there are a number of tours on offer to those wishing to tackle the watzmann .
the most popular is the two-day tour which includes an overnight stay at the watzmannhaus .
there are a number of options as well with different starting points around the base offering tours ranging in time between three to six hours . at the end of the first day , mountaineers are rewarded with the welcome sight of the watzmannhaus , which is managed by the german alpine club and is open from the middle of may until the middle of october .
it is wise for those who wish to stay at the stone construction lodge in the summer season to book a bed well in advance .
dormitories provide a communal atmosphere while smaller , more private rooms are available for two to six persons . choice of summits for different levels on the second day , the push for the summit begins early in the morning as the narrow slope can become congested with human traffic very quickly .
the watzmann consists of three summits : the hocheck at 2,651 meters is relatively easy to climb and takes about two to three hours to complete from the watzmannhaus . the middle point or mittelspitze at 2,713 meters requires a degree of alpine climbing experience .
the south point or südspitze at 2,712 meters and the descent to the wimbachgrieshütte lodge on the other side are only suitable for the confident , very fit mountaineers with the necessary climbing equipment .
the guides who lead the tours know what is required for each peak and are on hand to offer advice . most visitors attempt the hocheck summit and the mittelspitze .
from there , the return journey takes you back to the watzmannhaus which once again offers a welcome resting point before heading back down to the valley below . once back in the valley , those who are still fit and eager have the choice of a number of tours around the königssee which also offers overnight accommodation in huts around the crystal-clear lake . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 turkey changes laws to meet eu standards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms are meant to bring turkey on track for eu membership talks the turkish government agreed on 348 new paragraphs to brings it 80-year-old penal code , which punished sheep theft harder than assault , up to european standard .
extending women 's rights was especially controversial . the turkish government wants to implement the changes , which the opposition party said it will not challenge , quickly - ideally before an october decision by the european commission on whether the eu should begin accession talks with ankara .
the reforms are turkey 's latest batch of legal adjustments , made to boost the country 's chances for eu membership .
in the past two years , turkey passed laws that increased freedom of speech and reduced the role of the military .
" the old laws were focused on the state .
they limited citizens ' freedom to protect the state , " hakki köyklü of the ruling justice and development party said .
" now we 're putting the people in the center . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians want to put a stop to torture in police stations that means torture in police stations and prisons will be punished with 12 years in jail .
sending children to beg in the streets will also receive harsher punishment , as will child abuse .
genocide , crimes against humanity and people trafficking will also make their first appearances in the turkish penal code .
women 's rights improved but it was sexual crimes that politicians devoted most of their attention to - both in ankara and in brussels .
with pressure from the eu , women 's rights groups were able to outlaw rape in marriages and get old-fashioned terms like " chastity , " " honor " and " moral " out of criminal law books .
forced virginity tests were struck from the books as have the sentence reductions for rapists who marry their victims and fathers who murder their " impure " daughters in so-called honor killings .
but one old moral custom managed to push its way back in to law .
justice minister cemil cicek said there were " social reasons " for making adultery illegal again , after it was struck from the statute book eight years ago .
" this is really not progressive , " said sükrem eroglu , member of istanbul 's bar association .
" it 's a fully behind-the-times mentality . "
though joined by a few women 's groups , eroglu did n't have much company in his criticism - the public , for the most part , remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though allowed in public , headscarves in schools are still illegal the adultery ban is one of the few points the conservative parties can give to their voters .
they lost in their fight to lift the taboo on headscarves in turkish schools and universities .
no promises from eu while commending the progress ankara has made in the last two years , eu officials still are n't making any promises .
an august report by dutch advisory council on international affairs recommended beginning accession talks with turkey within the next two years , but warned the eu about setting a specific accession date , until the actual effects of the reforms can be seen .
" now we 're going to work together to get all of this finished before october , " justice minister cicek said .
" the rest is just details and tabloid news . " jörg pfuhl -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talks with turkey next on eu agenda outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey .

making the adjustment can be tough , but entrepreneurs from abroad can gain as much from germany as the country does from them . ali haydar berkpinar grew up in turkey , but came to germany while he was still in school .
today he 's the director of the german branch of the turkish carmaker tofa .
he may work in frankfurt , but he 's never forgotten his roots . " in many respects i actually feel like i 'm german , " he said .
" but culturally , speaking of the mental connection , i do think of turkey . " maximilian jaber , a palestinian-jordanian businessman , similarly sees himself as wandering between two cultures .
he 's chairman of the düsseldorf-based it consultancy comcave ag .
both the governments of bahrain and the united arab emirates belong to its list of customers .
but so do the state of baden-württemberg and dortmund 's chamber of commerce . " on one hand , i think like a german .
i also see myself as a citizen of the world .
and when something is about feelings - then i 'm more the emotional arab-palestinian , " jaber said . berkpinar and jaber are two immigrants who took integration for granted long ago : if you want to purse good business you ca n't cut yourself off from german society .
currently there are roughly 60,000 entrepreneurs of turkish origin in germany - and that 's not just the owners of kebab shops and corner fruit and vegetable stores . the hamburg travel agency magnate vural öger and textile maker kemal sahin in aachen are all about big business .
turkish bosses in germany are responsible for around € 30 billion in annual turnover .
they are crucially important taxpayers , creating jobs for more than 350,000 employees . the advantage of a mixed identity " what i first see as a german is reliability and punctuality , " said berkinpar .
" but flexibility of service is more of a turkish trait . " jaber also pointed out differences in mentality , saying his own multicultural identity - an arab business man with a base in germany - is often seen as an advantage .
" i think more globally and try to bring in cultural differences with what i 'm doing .
you become a bit more sensitive in that respect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there a many organizations set up to help entrepreneurs like jaber and berkpinar , such as the arab-german commerce association -lrb- ghorfa -rrb- in berlin and the newly founded turkish-german chamber of industry and commerce in cologne .
that helps cover business issues , but what about cultural difficulties ? conservative muslims often complain that they are not given time to pray during the day while working for german companies .
berkpinar is himself muslim , but orthodox employees do n't have an easier time working for him .
" generally speaking , german employees do n't pray at work either , " he said .
" if they have the need to pray they go to the church during their freetime .
it has no place on the job . " jaber views the matter differently .
he believes a modern and global firm should accommodate the religious needs of the workforce .
however , he also qualifies his support .
" companies in germany are already fighting with enough other problems , " he said .
" so you do n't necessarily need to set up a separate room for praying .

1 , 1939 , german troops crossed the border into poland .
the attack caused the outbreak of world war ii - the single biggest catastrophe of the 20th century . " tonight for the first time , poland fired shots against our territory and regular soldiers .
we have been returning fire since 5:45 a.m.
and from now on , we will retaliate , bomb for bomb . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer lays down a wreath at the ' central memorial of the federal republic of germany to the victims of war and tyranny ' commemorating the beginning of the word war ii with these words on sept .
1 , 1939 , adolf hitler announced that german troops had marched into poland .
the evening before , ss soldiers disguised as poles attacked the radio station of gleiwitz , a town on the german-polish border , and transmitted a message for the polish minority in the region to take arms against the germans .
this fictitious act of aggression was to serve as an alibi for the attack on poland . hitler had long been on the warpath .
fifteen years previously , he wrote in his book " mein kampf , " that the germans should seize more lebensraum - living space .
besides , his rationale went , peace between populations was impossible .
only war could determine survival . relations with poland were already strained during the weimar republic , due to the 1919 treaty of versailles , which laid down territorial acts of transfer to poland .
the state of east prussia was separated from the german reich by a polish corridor , something barely any german politicians were prepared to accept . strategy of deception when the national socialists took power in 1933 , hitler pursued closer ties to poland for tactical reasons - he wanted to create an impression , at least to outsiders , of his readiness for peace .
in 1934 , he signed a pact of non-aggression with poland . " there may be differences between our two countries in future , but the catastrophic effects of trying to solve them through actions of war would in no way be in proportion to any possible gain , " hitler said .
" the german government was therefore pleased to find that the leader of the polish state , marshall pilsudski , shares this opinion , and that this mutual realization has been turned into a contract , that wo n't just be of equal use to the polish and german peoples , but also will contribute significantly to the preservation of peace generally . " but the truth was that peace was not on hitler 's agenda .
instead of pursuing peace , he fuelled his plans for expansion .
in 1938 , austria was annexed by the german reich , then czechoslovakia - both without any military resistance . poland 's weak position poland 's fate was sealed when , at the end of august , 1939 , hitler surprisingly negotiated a pact of non-aggression with stalin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 turkey changes laws to meet eu standards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reforms are meant to bring turkey on track for eu membership talks the turkish government agreed on 348 new paragraphs to brings it 80-year-old penal code , which punished sheep theft harder than assault , up to european standard .
extending women 's rights was especially controversial . the turkish government wants to implement the changes , which the opposition party said it will not challenge , quickly - ideally before an october decision by the european commission on whether the eu should begin accession talks with ankara .
the reforms are turkey 's latest batch of legal adjustments , made to boost the country 's chances for eu membership .
in the past two years , turkey passed laws that increased freedom of speech and reduced the role of the military .
" the old laws were focused on the state .
they limited citizens ' freedom to protect the state , " hakki köyklü of the ruling justice and development party said .
" now we 're putting the people in the center . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians want to put a stop to torture in police stations that means torture in police stations and prisons will be punished with 12 years in jail .
sending children to beg in the streets will also receive harsher punishment , as will child abuse .
genocide , crimes against humanity and people trafficking will also make their first appearances in the turkish penal code .
women 's rights improved but it was sexual crimes that politicians devoted most of their attention to - both in ankara and in brussels .
with pressure from the eu , women 's rights groups were able to outlaw rape in marriages and get old-fashioned terms like " chastity , " " honor " and " moral " out of criminal law books .
forced virginity tests were struck from the books as have the sentence reductions for rapists who marry their victims and fathers who murder their " impure " daughters in so-called honor killings .
but one old moral custom managed to push its way back in to law .
justice minister cemil cicek said there were " social reasons " for making adultery illegal again , after it was struck from the statute book eight years ago .
" this is really not progressive , " said sükrem eroglu , member of istanbul 's bar association .
" it 's a fully behind-the-times mentality . "
though joined by a few women 's groups , eroglu did n't have much company in his criticism - the public , for the most part , remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though allowed in public , headscarves in schools are still illegal the adultery ban is one of the few points the conservative parties can give to their voters .
they lost in their fight to lift the taboo on headscarves in turkish schools and universities .
no promises from eu while commending the progress ankara has made in the last two years , eu officials still are n't making any promises .
an august report by dutch advisory council on international affairs recommended beginning accession talks with turkey within the next two years , but warned the eu about setting a specific accession date , until the actual effects of the reforms can be seen .
" now we 're going to work together to get all of this finished before october , " justice minister cicek said .
" the rest is just details and tabloid news . " jörg pfuhl -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talks with turkey next on eu agenda outlining his goals for his country 's six-month eu presidency before the european parliament , dutch premier jan-peter balkenende has called for fairness in deciding whether to start accession talks with turkey .

although shadowed by the zugspitze , the second highest peak in germany still attracts crowds of climbers eager to conquer its summit and view the alpine lake below . even though it lacks the prestige of being the highest peak in germany , the watzmann still attracts crowds of mountaineers every year , all eager to conquer the second highest summit in the country . some mountaineers return time and time again to climb the mountain while others take their satisfaction from just one ascent .
even though at 2,713 meters it is dwarfed by the zugspitze , which at 2,962 meters has more to offer , reaching the top of the watzmann is something really quite special . set in bavaria 's berchtesgadener land national park which surrounds the königssee alpine lake , the watzmann offers a great climbing experience in an area well known as the pearl of the german alpine region .
the challenge is one that mountaineers must attempt completely on foot .
ulike the zugspitze , there is no cable car to the peak . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no trip up the watzmann would be complete without a stop at the legendary watzmannhaus .
located 2,000 meters from the base of the most demanding incline on the mountain , the 100-year-old mountaineers ' refuge provides welcome shelter for a brief stop or an overnight stay either on the way up or way down .
whatever direction you are taking , the view from the terrace is breath-taking with a clear view before you and mountains on either side . tours for every ambition there are a number of tours on offer to those wishing to tackle the watzmann .
the most popular is the two-day tour which includes an overnight stay at the watzmannhaus .
there are a number of options as well with different starting points around the base offering tours ranging in time between three to six hours . at the end of the first day , mountaineers are rewarded with the welcome sight of the watzmannhaus , which is managed by the german alpine club and is open from the middle of may until the middle of october .
it is wise for those who wish to stay at the stone construction lodge in the summer season to book a bed well in advance .
dormitories provide a communal atmosphere while smaller , more private rooms are available for two to six persons . choice of summits for different levels on the second day , the push for the summit begins early in the morning as the narrow slope can become congested with human traffic very quickly .
the watzmann consists of three summits : the hocheck at 2,651 meters is relatively easy to climb and takes about two to three hours to complete from the watzmannhaus . the middle point or mittelspitze at 2,713 meters requires a degree of alpine climbing experience .
the south point or südspitze at 2,712 meters and the descent to the wimbachgrieshütte lodge on the other side are only suitable for the confident , very fit mountaineers with the necessary climbing equipment .
the guides who lead the tours know what is required for each peak and are on hand to offer advice . most visitors attempt the hocheck summit and the mittelspitze .
from there , the return journey takes you back to the watzmannhaus which once again offers a welcome resting point before heading back down to the valley below . once back in the valley , those who are still fit and eager have the choice of a number of tours around the königssee which also offers overnight accommodation in huts around the crystal-clear lake . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

although shadowed by the zugspitze , the second highest peak in germany still attracts crowds of climbers eager to conquer its summit and view the alpine lake below . even though it lacks the prestige of being the highest peak in germany , the watzmann still attracts crowds of mountaineers every year , all eager to conquer the second highest summit in the country . some mountaineers return time and time again to climb the mountain while others take their satisfaction from just one ascent .
even though at 2,713 meters it is dwarfed by the zugspitze , which at 2,962 meters has more to offer , reaching the top of the watzmann is something really quite special . set in bavaria 's berchtesgadener land national park which surrounds the königssee alpine lake , the watzmann offers a great climbing experience in an area well known as the pearl of the german alpine region .
the challenge is one that mountaineers must attempt completely on foot .
ulike the zugspitze , there is no cable car to the peak . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no trip up the watzmann would be complete without a stop at the legendary watzmannhaus .
located 2,000 meters from the base of the most demanding incline on the mountain , the 100-year-old mountaineers ' refuge provides welcome shelter for a brief stop or an overnight stay either on the way up or way down .
whatever direction you are taking , the view from the terrace is breath-taking with a clear view before you and mountains on either side . tours for every ambition there are a number of tours on offer to those wishing to tackle the watzmann .
the most popular is the two-day tour which includes an overnight stay at the watzmannhaus .
there are a number of options as well with different starting points around the base offering tours ranging in time between three to six hours . at the end of the first day , mountaineers are rewarded with the welcome sight of the watzmannhaus , which is managed by the german alpine club and is open from the middle of may until the middle of october .
it is wise for those who wish to stay at the stone construction lodge in the summer season to book a bed well in advance .
dormitories provide a communal atmosphere while smaller , more private rooms are available for two to six persons . choice of summits for different levels on the second day , the push for the summit begins early in the morning as the narrow slope can become congested with human traffic very quickly .
the watzmann consists of three summits : the hocheck at 2,651 meters is relatively easy to climb and takes about two to three hours to complete from the watzmannhaus . the middle point or mittelspitze at 2,713 meters requires a degree of alpine climbing experience .
the south point or südspitze at 2,712 meters and the descent to the wimbachgrieshütte lodge on the other side are only suitable for the confident , very fit mountaineers with the necessary climbing equipment .
the guides who lead the tours know what is required for each peak and are on hand to offer advice . most visitors attempt the hocheck summit and the mittelspitze .
from there , the return journey takes you back to the watzmannhaus which once again offers a welcome resting point before heading back down to the valley below . once back in the valley , those who are still fit and eager have the choice of a number of tours around the königssee which also offers overnight accommodation in huts around the crystal-clear lake . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a sunshade for germany 's highest peak what started as an operation for saving ski areas has turned out to be a successful environmental measure to protect glaciers from melting away .

it 's german men who need to watch out for wandering eyes - only two percent of women said their partner was the best looking man around .
it 's not men 's lack of effort that 's putting women off .
while 90 percent of both sexes agreed taking care of your teeth is important , the study showed men regularly take part in sports and go to the hair-dresser more often than women .
east-west divide the study also showed another beauty trend .
western germans rate themselves attractive more often than their countrymen in eastern germany . answering the question of whether their appearance has ever helped them , 62 percent of people from western germany answered yes , a sentiment felt by 48 percent of people in the former east german states .
in fact , 12.5 percent of eastern germans said their looks actually hurt them , just under six percent of westerners thought so . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sun , sea and a new nose germans are finding a little bit of vacation - and plastic surgery - can work wonders for their looks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : caucasian cycle of conflict gunmen release some russian hostages militants raid russian region of ingushetia 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 01.09.2004 opinion : is chechnya russia 's palestine ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 10 years of war , chechens live in desperate conditions russia has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks over the past week , the cause for which lies in chechnya .
the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .
but that should n't be all he does , as that 's not enough to stem the spread of terrorism at the social and psychological level . after years of war , most residents of chechnya live in desperate conditions , with little hope of finding regular work .
corruption , nepotism and widespread abuse of power are preventing the situation from getting any better .
added to this is the brutal behavior of criminal russian soldiers or chechnyan security personnel loyal to moscow .
murders and kidnappings by the " masked men " have created a climate of fear .
young chechens in their early 20s have , after a decade or war and lawlessness , experienced little else in their lives .
a disillusioned generation is coming to the fore - a generation that sees terrorism and suicide bombings as their only way out . decisive action needed that 's why president putin must ensure that criminal russian security officers feel the full punishment of the law .
crimes have to be avenged in open and fair court proceedings , so that chechens can begin to trust the russian state .
in addition , considerable financial support is necessary .
and instead of being embezzled by corrupt civil servants , the funds should be handled transparently , and lead to a real reconstruction of chechnya .
given the high price of oil , russia has enough money , as the 28 percent rise in military expenditure for the 2005 budget shows . such steps demand strength , long-term vision and decisive action from the russian leadership .
otherwise , there is a real danger that chechnya will become the palestine of russia , and that terrorist attacks will - as in israel - become an everyday occurrence . ingo mannteufel -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gunmen release some russian hostages gunmen with explosives strapped around their waists took up to 240 people hostage at a school in southern russia near war-torn chechnya wednesday .

even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .
essentially , it 's the right choice .
putin can not avoid using the law to pursue terrorists .

the renewed attacks raise the question of whether the conflict between russia and chechnya can be resolved . attacks on russian passenger flights , a suicide bombing in the center of moscow , and now , a hostage-taking at a russian school in north ossetia .
within a week , the chechen conflict has worked itself back into the consciousness and everyday lives of russians in the most horrific way possible .
and once again , the question has arisen : can the conflict be solved ? some western commentators are certain to revive the suggestion that there should be an " internationalization " of the chechen conflict , even though that suggestion is unrealistic .
for the russian leadership , such proof of weakness would be amount to admission of its ineptitude .
the super-power mentality of putin and the political elite - not to mention large parts of the russian population - speaks against taking such a step . several observers are also likely to demand negotiations with the president of chechnya , aslan maskhadov .
but in the meantime , it 's become completely unclear which group of rebels he actually represents .
if it turns out that he is harboring the terrorists responsible for the latest wave of attacks - something he has denied - then he would immediately cease to be a negotiating partner .
even if he really had nothing to do with the attacks , it 's still questionable whether negotiations with him would help prevent further acts of terror or bring chechnya 's guerrilla war to an end . a disillusioned generation instead , president vladimir putin is likely to continue pushing his politics of power and issuing decrees to step up security measures .

john archer , chairman of maldon district council , said it was hoped the festival would be " bigger and better " than last year 's inaugural event .
maldon received a boost in recognition among foodies when television chef delia smith praised the qualities of its sea salt .
two entrepreneurs were granted a 25-year lease last year to farm oyster beds by maldon district council .
diseases , and bad weather , had eroded maldon 's reputation for oysters in the 1960s .

the survey by the princess royal trust for carers found that 14 % of seven to 19-year-olds looked after someone with illness , disability or health problems .
this would correspond to 115,000 youngsters acting as carers , more than five times higher than the figure for under-19s in the 2001 census .
the trust said the study should act as a " wake-up call " for local councils .
louise mcdonald , a carer services co-ordinator for the trust , said it was thought to be the first time a national survey was conducted where young people themselves were asked about their caring situation . "
we believe that only a tiny percentage of young carers are getting the help they need " louise mcdonald the princess royal trust for carers ms mcdonald said the census was filled in by parents of young people , who may not necessarily admit that their child is looking after them or a brother or sister .
she added : " we believe that only a tiny percentage of young carers are getting the help they need .
" more detailed research needs to be done , but these figures should be a wake-up call for those local authorities who ignore the needs of young people who look after someone .
" agencies that support adults have not often considered to what extent the support package they have put in place relies on the hidden caring of a child .
" if they asked the adults whom they support a few simple questions , that could change . "
the trust said tasks ranged from personal care for a physically disabled adult , making sure a brother or sister with a learning disability played safely , or staying in to be there for a parent who misuses substances or has a mental illness .
the survey questioned 1,320 young people across the uk and found the highest proportion of youngsters acting as carers in the east midlands , with 19 % , followed by the north of england , at 15 % and 14 % in scotland .
it helped in the development of a new website , youngcarers.net , which provides information for young carers and professionals , such as teachers .

the survey by the princess royal trust for carers found that 14 % of seven to 19-year-olds looked after someone with illness , disability or health problems .
this would correspond to 115,000 youngsters acting as carers , more than five times higher than the figure for under-19s in the 2001 census .
the trust said the study should act as a " wake-up call " for local councils .
louise mcdonald , a carer services co-ordinator for the trust , said it was thought to be the first time a national survey was conducted where young people themselves were asked about their caring situation .
we believe that only a tiny percentage of young carers are getting the help they need louise mcdonald the princess royal trust for carers ms mcdonald said the census was filled in by parents of young people , who may not necessarily admit that their child is looking after them or a brother or sister .
she added : " we believe that only a tiny percentage of young carers are getting the help they need .
" more detailed research needs to be done , but these figures should be a wake-up call for those local authorities who ignore the needs of young people who look after someone .
" agencies that support adults have not often considered to what extent the support package they have put in place relies on the hidden caring of a child .
" if they asked the adults whom they support a few simple questions , that could change . "
the trust said tasks ranged from personal care for a physically disabled adult , making sure a brother or sister with a learning disability played safely , or staying in to be there for a parent who misuses substances or has a mental illness .
the survey questioned 1,320 young people across the uk and found the highest proportion of youngsters acting as carers in the east midlands , with 19 % , followed by the north of england , at 15 % and 14 % in scotland .
it helped in the development of a new website , youngcarers.net , which provides information for young carers and professionals , such as teachers .

police believe spitting attacks on drivers are more common than records show , as the victims feel humiliated and think there is little chance of catching the culprit .

police believe spitting attacks on drivers are more common than records show , as the victims feel humiliated and think there is little chance of catching the culprit .
but samples can be put on the national dna database and , if a match is made , charges of causing a public nuisance or actual bodily harm could be brought .
brent police commander chief superintendent andy bamber said : " being spat at is offensive , degrading and demeaning and the impact can be enormous . "
' intimidated and humiliated ' the kits are being introduced by bus operator metroline and the transport & general workers ' union and drivers have been trained how to use them .
metroline managing director steve mcaleavy said : " spitting is totally unacceptable behaviour and can leave drivers feeling intimidated and humiliated yet it is under reported and offenders rarely prosecuted . "
last august , tube staff at central london stations were issued with the dna kits to stop people spitting on them .
the kits have also been used by train staff on first great western trains and traffic wardens in scotland .
