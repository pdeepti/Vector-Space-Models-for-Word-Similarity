financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esfira hegedues , a former slave laborer under the nazi regime , receives a compensation check from karl brozik from the jewish claims conference .
the foundation 's partner organizations had succeeded in documenting more slave labor cases than had been originally estimated .
this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .
some € 14.1 million will go to russian partner foundations .
distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .
earlier compensation payments had been tainted by misuse .
but the board of directors said cooperation with their partner organizations was now going smoothly without any major irregularities in distributing the money .
hans-otto bräutigam , the evz 's newly-elected managing director and former justice minister in the federal state of brandenburg said he was working towards making the efforts of his team more public inside germany . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge dismisses nazi compensation suit against german firms a federal judge in the united states dismissed a lawsuit that claimed 17 german companies withheld $ 100 million from a fund for victims of nazi-era forced labor .

but a german and a nation of greeks have other ideas . no one should still consider greece the surprise package of euro 2004 .
the greeks have beaten the host nation , held the spanish and repelled enough russian attacks to get through a group stage which had already formed the team 's obituary before they even set foot in portugal . now , greece coach otto rehhagel believes his team is in a no-lose situation going into friday 's quarter-final against reigning european champion france and everyone should take note .
the greeks are here on merit and will enjoy their position while wanting more of the good feeling flowing through the tournament 's underdogs . " we have already won everything we could have dreamed of - we do n't have anything to lose now , " the german coach said at his team 's press conference on wednesday .
" we know france have the best players in europe , but we 'll play with strength and passion . " " we have to control the ball through the midfield to set the game 's pace , which we did n't do against russia . " rehhagel will know better than anyone else what his team 's strengths are even though more and more people are beginning to appreciate the discipline and well-drilled tactics of a greek team that has exceeded all expectations . the german coach will be glad to reintroduce giorgos karagounis after a one-match ban to add some much-needed steel and pace in midfield while midfielder vassilis tsiartas refused to be overawed by the prospect of playing france .
both omens spell reinforcement for the only area in which greece was second best to a russian team with nothing to lose . but against a french team with everything at stake , the greeks insist they could well produce another shock after beating portugal in the opening game of the tournament . " every team has its possibilities , and so do we , " said tsiartas .
" if you go into the game thinking you have no chance , then you will definitely lose .
a lot of things have changed in football .
there are not so many differences between teams .
now the big teams need to prove they belong where they are . " greece will face the reigning champions , who are progressing at a pace and with performances far below their best .
however , coach jacques santini is confident his team can make it all the way to the final despite their below-par performances so far . " we came here to win the title , " said santini .
" we played three matches and i hope there are three more to go .
i must admit there are things which could be improved , but we 're going to work this out .
i 'm confident .
we 're getting better in every game . " the players are also aware that things need to change if the french are to recapture their form and retain the henri delauney trophy .
" it 's normal people are being critical of us but that 's because they have come to expect so much of us , " said midfielder claude makelele , admitting les bleus had yet to hit top form in the tournament .

german films have a particularly difficult time of it .
while french films are considered fanciful and italian productions passionate , german films are the heavyweights of european cinema , with the reputation of being melancholic and gloomy . that 's perhaps one of the reasons why the market share for german films in north america last year was just a meager 0.15 percent - the equivalent of 2.2 million viewers . the lighter side of cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franka potente starred in the fast-paced tom tykwer film , " run lola run , " which hit cinemas in 1998 .

the average german film costs about the same amount to make as a small american independent production .
and while in germany the director plays a large role in a film 's success , in the u.s. , it 's star power that counts .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esfira hegedues , a former slave laborer under the nazi regime , receives a compensation check from karl brozik from the jewish claims conference .
the foundation 's partner organizations had succeeded in documenting more slave labor cases than had been originally estimated .
this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .
some € 14.1 million will go to russian partner foundations .
distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .
earlier compensation payments had been tainted by misuse .
but the board of directors said cooperation with their partner organizations was now going smoothly without any major irregularities in distributing the money .
hans-otto bräutigam , the evz 's newly-elected managing director and former justice minister in the federal state of brandenburg said he was working towards making the efforts of his team more public inside germany . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge dismisses nazi compensation suit against german firms a federal judge in the united states dismissed a lawsuit that claimed 17 german companies withheld $ 100 million from a fund for victims of nazi-era forced labor .

but a german and a nation of greeks have other ideas . no one should still consider greece the surprise package of euro 2004 .
the greeks have beaten the host nation , held the spanish and repelled enough russian attacks to get through a group stage which had already formed the team 's obituary before they even set foot in portugal . now , greece coach otto rehhagel believes his team is in a no-lose situation going into friday 's quarter-final against reigning european champion france and everyone should take note .
the greeks are here on merit and will enjoy their position while wanting more of the good feeling flowing through the tournament 's underdogs . " we have already won everything we could have dreamed of - we do n't have anything to lose now , " the german coach said at his team 's press conference on wednesday .
" we know france have the best players in europe , but we 'll play with strength and passion . " " we have to control the ball through the midfield to set the game 's pace , which we did n't do against russia . " rehhagel will know better than anyone else what his team 's strengths are even though more and more people are beginning to appreciate the discipline and well-drilled tactics of a greek team that has exceeded all expectations . the german coach will be glad to reintroduce giorgos karagounis after a one-match ban to add some much-needed steel and pace in midfield while midfielder vassilis tsiartas refused to be overawed by the prospect of playing france .
both omens spell reinforcement for the only area in which greece was second best to a russian team with nothing to lose . but against a french team with everything at stake , the greeks insist they could well produce another shock after beating portugal in the opening game of the tournament . " every team has its possibilities , and so do we , " said tsiartas .
" if you go into the game thinking you have no chance , then you will definitely lose .
a lot of things have changed in football .
there are not so many differences between teams .
now the big teams need to prove they belong where they are . " greece will face the reigning champions , who are progressing at a pace and with performances far below their best .
however , coach jacques santini is confident his team can make it all the way to the final despite their below-par performances so far . " we came here to win the title , " said santini .
" we played three matches and i hope there are three more to go .
i must admit there are things which could be improved , but we 're going to work this out .
i 'm confident .
we 're getting better in every game . " the players are also aware that things need to change if the french are to recapture their form and retain the henri delauney trophy .
" it 's normal people are being critical of us but that 's because they have come to expect so much of us , " said midfielder claude makelele , admitting les bleus had yet to hit top form in the tournament .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esfira hegedues , a former slave laborer under the nazi regime , receives a compensation check from karl brozik from the jewish claims conference .
the foundation 's partner organizations had succeeded in documenting more slave labor cases than had been originally estimated .
this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .
some € 14.1 million will go to russian partner foundations .
distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .
earlier compensation payments had been tainted by misuse .
but the board of directors said cooperation with their partner organizations was now going smoothly without any major irregularities in distributing the money .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esfira hegedues , a former slave laborer under the nazi regime , receives a compensation check from karl brozik from the jewish claims conference .

this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .

german films have a particularly difficult time of it .
while french films are considered fanciful and italian productions passionate , german films are the heavyweights of european cinema , with the reputation of being melancholic and gloomy . that 's perhaps one of the reasons why the market share for german films in north america last year was just a meager 0.15 percent - the equivalent of 2.2 million viewers . the lighter side of cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franka potente starred in the fast-paced tom tykwer film , " run lola run , " which hit cinemas in 1998 .

the ruling rejected an appeal by a muslim teacher in the southern german state of baden württemberg who had argued that the law impinged upon her religious rights .
in april , the state government in stuttgart enacted a law forbidding headscarves in its schools .
afghan-born fereshda ludin had previously taken her case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court upheld her right to wear a headscarf , but the judges also gave states the right to pass laws banning headscarves , a move promptly taken by baden württemberg and a handful of other states , which argued the hijab violated the state 's religious neutrality . dw-world.de multicultural symbol or gateway to fundamentalism ?
of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .
with italy , bulgaria and sweden in their qualifying group , the danes were written-off as third spot losers before a ball was kicked .
but the fuse on the danish dynamite is fizzing now , even if it has failed to fully ignite .
jon dahl tomasson is gaining confidence with every game and goal and will not fear the czech defense as he and his attacking partners aim to shoot down the tournaments most in-form team .
where the danes could come unstuck is in their own final third of the pitch .
baros , nedved , koller , rosicky and poborski are all on fire and if the czech rearguard can hold , the attacking formation from forwards to maverick midfield should dampen the flame . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official uefa euro 2004 web site all the teams , all the players , all the news from the european soccer championships being held in portugal during june and july .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .

but a german and a nation of greeks have other ideas . no one should still consider greece the surprise package of euro 2004 .
the greeks have beaten the host nation , held the spanish and repelled enough russian attacks to get through a group stage which had already formed the team 's obituary before they even set foot in portugal . now , greece coach otto rehhagel believes his team is in a no-lose situation going into friday 's quarter-final against reigning european champion france and everyone should take note .
the greeks are here on merit and will enjoy their position while wanting more of the good feeling flowing through the tournament 's underdogs . " we have already won everything we could have dreamed of - we do n't have anything to lose now , " the german coach said at his team 's press conference on wednesday .
" we know france have the best players in europe , but we 'll play with strength and passion . " " we have to control the ball through the midfield to set the game 's pace , which we did n't do against russia . " rehhagel will know better than anyone else what his team 's strengths are even though more and more people are beginning to appreciate the discipline and well-drilled tactics of a greek team that has exceeded all expectations . the german coach will be glad to reintroduce giorgos karagounis after a one-match ban to add some much-needed steel and pace in midfield while midfielder vassilis tsiartas refused to be overawed by the prospect of playing france .
both omens spell reinforcement for the only area in which greece was second best to a russian team with nothing to lose . but against a french team with everything at stake , the greeks insist they could well produce another shock after beating portugal in the opening game of the tournament . " every team has its possibilities , and so do we , " said tsiartas .
" if you go into the game thinking you have no chance , then you will definitely lose .
a lot of things have changed in football .
there are not so many differences between teams .
now the big teams need to prove they belong where they are . " greece will face the reigning champions , who are progressing at a pace and with performances far below their best .
however , coach jacques santini is confident his team can make it all the way to the final despite their below-par performances so far . " we came here to win the title , " said santini .
" we played three matches and i hope there are three more to go .
i must admit there are things which could be improved , but we 're going to work this out .
i 'm confident .
we 're getting better in every game . " the players are also aware that things need to change if the french are to recapture their form and retain the henri delauney trophy .
" it 's normal people are being critical of us but that 's because they have come to expect so much of us , " said midfielder claude makelele , admitting les bleus had yet to hit top form in the tournament .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .

the ruling rejected an appeal by a muslim teacher in the southern german state of baden württemberg who had argued that the law impinged upon her religious rights .
in april , the state government in stuttgart enacted a law forbidding headscarves in its schools .
afghan-born fereshda ludin had previously taken her case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court upheld her right to wear a headscarf , but the judges also gave states the right to pass laws banning headscarves , a move promptly taken by baden württemberg and a handful of other states , which argued the hijab violated the state 's religious neutrality . dw-world.de multicultural symbol or gateway to fundamentalism ?

" was a hit in the u.s. at this year 's media forum in cologne , directors , actors and pr experts discussed how the image of german film in the u.s. is changing from gloomy subject matter for a select few to happier , more mainstream fare . the heart of global cinema beats in hollywood .
romantic tearjerkers , teen comedies , or colourful cartoon adventures - mainstream movies from across the atlantic have long been standard fare in european cinemas . but while blockbusters by spielberg & co. are guaranteed to be big draws at german box offices , the road leading in the opposite direction is much rockier . films from " old europe " are typically seen in the u.s. as sophisticated and demanding .
something for the die-hard film buff rather than an evening 's entertainment for popcorn-munching audiences .
german films have a particularly difficult time of it .
while french films are considered fanciful and italian productions passionate , german films are the heavyweights of european cinema , with the reputation of being melancholic and gloomy . that 's perhaps one of the reasons why the market share for german films in north america last year was just a meager 0.15 percent - the equivalent of 2.2 million viewers . the lighter side of cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franka potente starred in the fast-paced tom tykwer film , " run lola run , " which hit cinemas in 1998 .
but the situation is changing , and has been ever since german director tom tykwer 's fast-paced romantic thriller , " run lola run , " became a hit in the u.s. with its innovative plot twists and aesthetic appeal , the movie proved that not all german productions are automatically weighty and intellectual . they can have a good balance of pace and narrative , and still be fun to watch - just like the east-meets-west comedy , " good-bye lenin ! "
wolfgang becker 's film was a surprise success in the u.s. , long surpassing the $ 4 million mark .
and the kitchen-comedy " mostly martha " made twice as much money in the u.s. than in the domestic market . german directors such as wolfgang petersen and roland emmerich are currently taking hollywood by storm with their productions " troy " and " the day after tomorrow . " a lasting trend ? so does this trend have a future , or is it just a short-lived phenomenon ? " i hope that this upsurge will be sustainable , because european stories are of interest to foreign viewers , " said michael schmid-ospach , business manager of the film foundation in the state of north rhine-westphalia . the fact is that there are still huge budget differences between european and american productions .
the average german film costs about the same amount to make as a small american independent production .
and while in germany the director plays a large role in a film 's success , in the u.s. , it 's star power that counts .
" a director only gets the green light from the studios when a famous star signs on , because an a-list celebrity like tom cruise ensures approval of a $ 100 million budget , " said german actor , director and producer , til schweiger . cinematic accolades film festivals can also contribute significantly to a film 's success , said michael weber .
he is the business manager of bavaria film international , which markets german films such as " good-bye lenin ! " to the u.s.
" festivals and big competitions help set the course for further success , " he said .

an extensive advertising campaign also helped drum up interest in the german wartime drama . marketing is everything american pr expert nichola ellis recommends that german filmmakers learn from u.s. marketing know-how .
a catchy ad campaign that sticks in the public 's mind greatly increases a film 's recognition factor , and with it , box-office sales . unfortunately , such campaigns are in short supply in " old europe . "

the greeks are here on merit and will enjoy their position while wanting more of the good feeling flowing through the tournament 's underdogs . " we have already won everything we could have dreamed of - we do n't have anything to lose now , " the german coach said at his team 's press conference on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.06.2004 good bye melancholy , hello hollywood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker 's film " good-bye lenin ! " was a hit in the u.s. at this year 's media forum in cologne , directors , actors and pr experts discussed how the image of german film in the u.s. is changing from gloomy subject matter for a select few to happier , more mainstream fare . the heart of global cinema beats in hollywood .
romantic tearjerkers , teen comedies , or colourful cartoon adventures - mainstream movies from across the atlantic have long been standard fare in european cinemas . but while blockbusters by spielberg & co. are guaranteed to be big draws at german box offices , the road leading in the opposite direction is much rockier . films from " old europe " are typically seen in the u.s. as sophisticated and demanding .
something for the die-hard film buff rather than an evening 's entertainment for popcorn-munching audiences .
german films have a particularly difficult time of it .
while french films are considered fanciful and italian productions passionate , german films are the heavyweights of european cinema , with the reputation of being melancholic and gloomy . that 's perhaps one of the reasons why the market share for german films in north america last year was just a meager 0.15 percent - the equivalent of 2.2 million viewers . the lighter side of cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franka potente starred in the fast-paced tom tykwer film , " run lola run , " which hit cinemas in 1998 .
but the situation is changing , and has been ever since german director tom tykwer 's fast-paced romantic thriller , " run lola run , " became a hit in the u.s. with its innovative plot twists and aesthetic appeal , the movie proved that not all german productions are automatically weighty and intellectual . they can have a good balance of pace and narrative , and still be fun to watch - just like the east-meets-west comedy , " good-bye lenin ! "
wolfgang becker 's film was a surprise success in the u.s. , long surpassing the $ 4 million mark .
and the kitchen-comedy " mostly martha " made twice as much money in the u.s. than in the domestic market . german directors such as wolfgang petersen and roland emmerich are currently taking hollywood by storm with their productions " troy " and " the day after tomorrow . " a lasting trend ? so does this trend have a future , or is it just a short-lived phenomenon ? " i hope that this upsurge will be sustainable , because european stories are of interest to foreign viewers , " said michael schmid-ospach , business manager of the film foundation in the state of north rhine-westphalia . the fact is that there are still huge budget differences between european and american productions .
the average german film costs about the same amount to make as a small american independent production .
and while in germany the director plays a large role in a film 's success , in the u.s. , it 's star power that counts .
" a director only gets the green light from the studios when a famous star signs on , because an a-list celebrity like tom cruise ensures approval of a $ 100 million budget , " said german actor , director and producer , til schweiger . cinematic accolades film festivals can also contribute significantly to a film 's success , said michael weber .
he is the business manager of bavaria film international , which markets german films such as " good-bye lenin ! " to the u.s.
" festivals and big competitions help set the course for further success , " he said .
more than bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director caroline link was honored with an oscar for the best foreign movie for her film " nowhere in africa . " anything else , an oscar nomination can work wonders for a film , as was the case with caroline link 's film , " nowhere in africa , " which won the best foreign language film award in 2003 . instead of bringing in the usual $ 1 - $ 2 million , " nowhere in africa " rang up more than $ 6 million in u.s. ticket sales .
an extensive advertising campaign also helped drum up interest in the german wartime drama . marketing is everything american pr expert nichola ellis recommends that german filmmakers learn from u.s. marketing know-how .
a catchy ad campaign that sticks in the public 's mind greatly increases a film 's recognition factor , and with it , box-office sales . unfortunately , such campaigns are in short supply in " old europe . "
european filmmakers typically look at how much money they 've got , and then create their advertising strategy accordingly .
" the americans have a completely different way of thinking about it , " stressed ellis .
" they come up with a promising campaign first , and only then calculate how much money they 'll need to get it off the ground .

but a german and a nation of greeks have other ideas . no one should still consider greece the surprise package of euro 2004 .
the greeks have beaten the host nation , held the spanish and repelled enough russian attacks to get through a group stage which had already formed the team 's obituary before they even set foot in portugal . now , greece coach otto rehhagel believes his team is in a no-lose situation going into friday 's quarter-final against reigning european champion france and everyone should take note .
the greeks are here on merit and will enjoy their position while wanting more of the good feeling flowing through the tournament 's underdogs . " we have already won everything we could have dreamed of - we do n't have anything to lose now , " the german coach said at his team 's press conference on wednesday .
" we know france have the best players in europe , but we 'll play with strength and passion . " " we have to control the ball through the midfield to set the game 's pace , which we did n't do against russia . " rehhagel will know better than anyone else what his team 's strengths are even though more and more people are beginning to appreciate the discipline and well-drilled tactics of a greek team that has exceeded all expectations . the german coach will be glad to reintroduce giorgos karagounis after a one-match ban to add some much-needed steel and pace in midfield while midfielder vassilis tsiartas refused to be overawed by the prospect of playing france .
both omens spell reinforcement for the only area in which greece was second best to a russian team with nothing to lose . but against a french team with everything at stake , the greeks insist they could well produce another shock after beating portugal in the opening game of the tournament . " every team has its possibilities , and so do we , " said tsiartas .
" if you go into the game thinking you have no chance , then you will definitely lose .
a lot of things have changed in football .
there are not so many differences between teams .
now the big teams need to prove they belong where they are . " greece will face the reigning champions , who are progressing at a pace and with performances far below their best .
however , coach jacques santini is confident his team can make it all the way to the final despite their below-par performances so far . " we came here to win the title , " said santini .
" we played three matches and i hope there are three more to go .
i must admit there are things which could be improved , but we 're going to work this out .
i 'm confident .
we 're getting better in every game . " the players are also aware that things need to change if the french are to recapture their form and retain the henri delauney trophy .
" it 's normal people are being critical of us but that 's because they have come to expect so much of us , " said midfielder claude makelele , admitting les bleus had yet to hit top form in the tournament .
" we want to start playing again the football we know that we are capable of . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .
with italy , bulgaria and sweden in their qualifying group , the danes were written-off as third spot losers before a ball was kicked .
but the fuse on the danish dynamite is fizzing now , even if it has failed to fully ignite .
jon dahl tomasson is gaining confidence with every game and goal and will not fear the czech defense as he and his attacking partners aim to shoot down the tournaments most in-form team .
where the danes could come unstuck is in their own final third of the pitch .
baros , nedved , koller , rosicky and poborski are all on fire and if the czech rearguard can hold , the attacking formation from forwards to maverick midfield should dampen the flame . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official uefa euro 2004 web site all the teams , all the players , all the news from the european soccer championships being held in portugal during june and july .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .

" was a hit in the u.s. at this year 's media forum in cologne , directors , actors and pr experts discussed how the image of german film in the u.s. is changing from gloomy subject matter for a select few to happier , more mainstream fare . the heart of global cinema beats in hollywood .
romantic tearjerkers , teen comedies , or colourful cartoon adventures - mainstream movies from across the atlantic have long been standard fare in european cinemas . but while blockbusters by spielberg & co. are guaranteed to be big draws at german box offices , the road leading in the opposite direction is much rockier . films from " old europe " are typically seen in the u.s. as sophisticated and demanding .
something for the die-hard film buff rather than an evening 's entertainment for popcorn-munching audiences .
german films have a particularly difficult time of it .
while french films are considered fanciful and italian productions passionate , german films are the heavyweights of european cinema , with the reputation of being melancholic and gloomy . that 's perhaps one of the reasons why the market share for german films in north america last year was just a meager 0.15 percent - the equivalent of 2.2 million viewers . the lighter side of cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franka potente starred in the fast-paced tom tykwer film , " run lola run , " which hit cinemas in 1998 .
but the situation is changing , and has been ever since german director tom tykwer 's fast-paced romantic thriller , " run lola run , " became a hit in the u.s. with its innovative plot twists and aesthetic appeal , the movie proved that not all german productions are automatically weighty and intellectual . they can have a good balance of pace and narrative , and still be fun to watch - just like the east-meets-west comedy , " good-bye lenin ! "
wolfgang becker 's film was a surprise success in the u.s. , long surpassing the $ 4 million mark .
and the kitchen-comedy " mostly martha " made twice as much money in the u.s. than in the domestic market . german directors such as wolfgang petersen and roland emmerich are currently taking hollywood by storm with their productions " troy " and " the day after tomorrow . " a lasting trend ? so does this trend have a future , or is it just a short-lived phenomenon ? " i hope that this upsurge will be sustainable , because european stories are of interest to foreign viewers , " said michael schmid-ospach , business manager of the film foundation in the state of north rhine-westphalia . the fact is that there are still huge budget differences between european and american productions .
the average german film costs about the same amount to make as a small american independent production .
and while in germany the director plays a large role in a film 's success , in the u.s. , it 's star power that counts .
" a director only gets the green light from the studios when a famous star signs on , because an a-list celebrity like tom cruise ensures approval of a $ 100 million budget , " said german actor , director and producer , til schweiger . cinematic accolades film festivals can also contribute significantly to a film 's success , said michael weber .
he is the business manager of bavaria film international , which markets german films such as " good-bye lenin ! " to the u.s.
" festivals and big competitions help set the course for further success , " he said .

" anything else , an oscar nomination can work wonders for a film , as was the case with caroline link 's film , " nowhere in africa , " which won the best foreign language film award in 2003 . instead of bringing in the usual $ 1 - $ 2 million , " nowhere in africa " rang up more than $ 6 million in u.s. ticket sales .
an extensive advertising campaign also helped drum up interest in the german wartime drama . marketing is everything american pr expert nichola ellis recommends that german filmmakers learn from u.s. marketing know-how .
a catchy ad campaign that sticks in the public 's mind greatly increases a film 's recognition factor , and with it , box-office sales . unfortunately , such campaigns are in short supply in " old europe . "
european filmmakers typically look at how much money they 've got , and then create their advertising strategy accordingly .
" the americans have a completely different way of thinking about it , " stressed ellis .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .
with italy , bulgaria and sweden in their qualifying group , the danes were written-off as third spot losers before a ball was kicked .
but the fuse on the danish dynamite is fizzing now , even if it has failed to fully ignite .
jon dahl tomasson is gaining confidence with every game and goal and will not fear the czech defense as he and his attacking partners aim to shoot down the tournaments most in-form team .
where the danes could come unstuck is in their own final third of the pitch .
baros , nedved , koller , rosicky and poborski are all on fire and if the czech rearguard can hold , the attacking formation from forwards to maverick midfield should dampen the flame . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official uefa euro 2004 web site all the teams , all the players , all the news from the european soccer championships being held in portugal during june and july .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .

board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .

distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esfira hegedues , a former slave laborer under the nazi regime , receives a compensation check from karl brozik from the jewish claims conference .
the foundation 's partner organizations had succeeded in documenting more slave labor cases than had been originally estimated .
this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .
some € 14.1 million will go to russian partner foundations .
distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .
earlier compensation payments had been tainted by misuse .
but the board of directors said cooperation with their partner organizations was now going smoothly without any major irregularities in distributing the money .
hans-otto bräutigam , the evz 's newly-elected managing director and former justice minister in the federal state of brandenburg said he was working towards making the efforts of his team more public inside germany . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge dismisses nazi compensation suit against german firms a federal judge in the united states dismissed a lawsuit that claimed 17 german companies withheld $ 100 million from a fund for victims of nazi-era forced labor .

" was a hit in the u.s. at this year 's media forum in cologne , directors , actors and pr experts discussed how the image of german film in the u.s. is changing from gloomy subject matter for a select few to happier , more mainstream fare . the heart of global cinema beats in hollywood .
romantic tearjerkers , teen comedies , or colourful cartoon adventures - mainstream movies from across the atlantic have long been standard fare in european cinemas . but while blockbusters by spielberg & co. are guaranteed to be big draws at german box offices , the road leading in the opposite direction is much rockier . films from " old europe " are typically seen in the u.s. as sophisticated and demanding .
something for the die-hard film buff rather than an evening 's entertainment for popcorn-munching audiences .
german films have a particularly difficult time of it .
while french films are considered fanciful and italian productions passionate , german films are the heavyweights of european cinema , with the reputation of being melancholic and gloomy . that 's perhaps one of the reasons why the market share for german films in north america last year was just a meager 0.15 percent - the equivalent of 2.2 million viewers . the lighter side of cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franka potente starred in the fast-paced tom tykwer film , " run lola run , " which hit cinemas in 1998 .
but the situation is changing , and has been ever since german director tom tykwer 's fast-paced romantic thriller , " run lola run , " became a hit in the u.s. with its innovative plot twists and aesthetic appeal , the movie proved that not all german productions are automatically weighty and intellectual . they can have a good balance of pace and narrative , and still be fun to watch - just like the east-meets-west comedy , " good-bye lenin ! "
wolfgang becker 's film was a surprise success in the u.s. , long surpassing the $ 4 million mark .
and the kitchen-comedy " mostly martha " made twice as much money in the u.s. than in the domestic market . german directors such as wolfgang petersen and roland emmerich are currently taking hollywood by storm with their productions " troy " and " the day after tomorrow . " a lasting trend ? so does this trend have a future , or is it just a short-lived phenomenon ? " i hope that this upsurge will be sustainable , because european stories are of interest to foreign viewers , " said michael schmid-ospach , business manager of the film foundation in the state of north rhine-westphalia . the fact is that there are still huge budget differences between european and american productions .
the average german film costs about the same amount to make as a small american independent production .
and while in germany the director plays a large role in a film 's success , in the u.s. , it 's star power that counts .
" a director only gets the green light from the studios when a famous star signs on , because an a-list celebrity like tom cruise ensures approval of a $ 100 million budget , " said german actor , director and producer , til schweiger . cinematic accolades film festivals can also contribute significantly to a film 's success , said michael weber .
he is the business manager of bavaria film international , which markets german films such as " good-bye lenin ! " to the u.s.
" festivals and big competitions help set the course for further success , " he said .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .

board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .

the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .

but a german and a nation of greeks have other ideas . no one should still consider greece the surprise package of euro 2004 .
the greeks have beaten the host nation , held the spanish and repelled enough russian attacks to get through a group stage which had already formed the team 's obituary before they even set foot in portugal . now , greece coach otto rehhagel believes his team is in a no-lose situation going into friday 's quarter-final against reigning european champion france and everyone should take note .
the greeks are here on merit and will enjoy their position while wanting more of the good feeling flowing through the tournament 's underdogs . " we have already won everything we could have dreamed of - we do n't have anything to lose now , " the german coach said at his team 's press conference on wednesday .
" we know france have the best players in europe , but we 'll play with strength and passion . " " we have to control the ball through the midfield to set the game 's pace , which we did n't do against russia . " rehhagel will know better than anyone else what his team 's strengths are even though more and more people are beginning to appreciate the discipline and well-drilled tactics of a greek team that has exceeded all expectations . the german coach will be glad to reintroduce giorgos karagounis after a one-match ban to add some much-needed steel and pace in midfield while midfielder vassilis tsiartas refused to be overawed by the prospect of playing france .
both omens spell reinforcement for the only area in which greece was second best to a russian team with nothing to lose . but against a french team with everything at stake , the greeks insist they could well produce another shock after beating portugal in the opening game of the tournament . " every team has its possibilities , and so do we , " said tsiartas .
" if you go into the game thinking you have no chance , then you will definitely lose .
a lot of things have changed in football .
there are not so many differences between teams .
now the big teams need to prove they belong where they are . " greece will face the reigning champions , who are progressing at a pace and with performances far below their best .
however , coach jacques santini is confident his team can make it all the way to the final despite their below-par performances so far . " we came here to win the title , " said santini .
" we played three matches and i hope there are three more to go .
i must admit there are things which could be improved , but we 're going to work this out .
i 'm confident .
we 're getting better in every game . " the players are also aware that things need to change if the french are to recapture their form and retain the henri delauney trophy .
" it 's normal people are being critical of us but that 's because they have come to expect so much of us , " said midfielder claude makelele , admitting les bleus had yet to hit top form in the tournament .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esfira hegedues , a former slave laborer under the nazi regime , receives a compensation check from karl brozik from the jewish claims conference .
the foundation 's partner organizations had succeeded in documenting more slave labor cases than had been originally estimated .
this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .
some € 14.1 million will go to russian partner foundations .
distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .
earlier compensation payments had been tainted by misuse .
but the board of directors said cooperation with their partner organizations was now going smoothly without any major irregularities in distributing the money .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esfira hegedues , a former slave laborer under the nazi regime , receives a compensation check from karl brozik from the jewish claims conference .
the foundation 's partner organizations had succeeded in documenting more slave labor cases than had been originally estimated .
this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .
some € 14.1 million will go to russian partner foundations .
distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .
earlier compensation payments had been tainted by misuse .
but the board of directors said cooperation with their partner organizations was now going smoothly without any major irregularities in distributing the money .

the ruling rejected an appeal by a muslim teacher in the southern german state of baden württemberg who had argued that the law impinged upon her religious rights .
in april , the state government in stuttgart enacted a law forbidding headscarves in its schools .
afghan-born fereshda ludin had previously taken her case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court upheld her right to wear a headscarf , but the judges also gave states the right to pass laws banning headscarves , a move promptly taken by baden württemberg and a handful of other states , which argued the hijab violated the state 's religious neutrality . dw-world.de multicultural symbol or gateway to fundamentalism ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.06.2004 good bye melancholy , hello hollywood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker 's film " good-bye lenin ! " was a hit in the u.s. at this year 's media forum in cologne , directors , actors and pr experts discussed how the image of german film in the u.s. is changing from gloomy subject matter for a select few to happier , more mainstream fare . the heart of global cinema beats in hollywood .
romantic tearjerkers , teen comedies , or colourful cartoon adventures - mainstream movies from across the atlantic have long been standard fare in european cinemas . but while blockbusters by spielberg & co. are guaranteed to be big draws at german box offices , the road leading in the opposite direction is much rockier . films from " old europe " are typically seen in the u.s. as sophisticated and demanding .
something for the die-hard film buff rather than an evening 's entertainment for popcorn-munching audiences .
german films have a particularly difficult time of it .
while french films are considered fanciful and italian productions passionate , german films are the heavyweights of european cinema , with the reputation of being melancholic and gloomy . that 's perhaps one of the reasons why the market share for german films in north america last year was just a meager 0.15 percent - the equivalent of 2.2 million viewers . the lighter side of cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franka potente starred in the fast-paced tom tykwer film , " run lola run , " which hit cinemas in 1998 .
but the situation is changing , and has been ever since german director tom tykwer 's fast-paced romantic thriller , " run lola run , " became a hit in the u.s. with its innovative plot twists and aesthetic appeal , the movie proved that not all german productions are automatically weighty and intellectual . they can have a good balance of pace and narrative , and still be fun to watch - just like the east-meets-west comedy , " good-bye lenin ! "
wolfgang becker 's film was a surprise success in the u.s. , long surpassing the $ 4 million mark .
and the kitchen-comedy " mostly martha " made twice as much money in the u.s. than in the domestic market . german directors such as wolfgang petersen and roland emmerich are currently taking hollywood by storm with their productions " troy " and " the day after tomorrow . " a lasting trend ? so does this trend have a future , or is it just a short-lived phenomenon ? " i hope that this upsurge will be sustainable , because european stories are of interest to foreign viewers , " said michael schmid-ospach , business manager of the film foundation in the state of north rhine-westphalia . the fact is that there are still huge budget differences between european and american productions .
the average german film costs about the same amount to make as a small american independent production .
and while in germany the director plays a large role in a film 's success , in the u.s. , it 's star power that counts .
" a director only gets the green light from the studios when a famous star signs on , because an a-list celebrity like tom cruise ensures approval of a $ 100 million budget , " said german actor , director and producer , til schweiger . cinematic accolades film festivals can also contribute significantly to a film 's success , said michael weber .
he is the business manager of bavaria film international , which markets german films such as " good-bye lenin ! " to the u.s.
" festivals and big competitions help set the course for further success , " he said .
more than bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german director caroline link was honored with an oscar for the best foreign movie for her film " nowhere in africa . " anything else , an oscar nomination can work wonders for a film , as was the case with caroline link 's film , " nowhere in africa , " which won the best foreign language film award in 2003 . instead of bringing in the usual $ 1 - $ 2 million , " nowhere in africa " rang up more than $ 6 million in u.s. ticket sales .
an extensive advertising campaign also helped drum up interest in the german wartime drama . marketing is everything american pr expert nichola ellis recommends that german filmmakers learn from u.s. marketing know-how .
a catchy ad campaign that sticks in the public 's mind greatly increases a film 's recognition factor , and with it , box-office sales . unfortunately , such campaigns are in short supply in " old europe . "
european filmmakers typically look at how much money they 've got , and then create their advertising strategy accordingly .
" the americans have a completely different way of thinking about it , " stressed ellis .
" they come up with a promising campaign first , and only then calculate how much money they 'll need to get it off the ground .

" was a hit in the u.s. at this year 's media forum in cologne , directors , actors and pr experts discussed how the image of german film in the u.s. is changing from gloomy subject matter for a select few to happier , more mainstream fare . the heart of global cinema beats in hollywood .
romantic tearjerkers , teen comedies , or colourful cartoon adventures - mainstream movies from across the atlantic have long been standard fare in european cinemas . but while blockbusters by spielberg & co. are guaranteed to be big draws at german box offices , the road leading in the opposite direction is much rockier . films from " old europe " are typically seen in the u.s. as sophisticated and demanding .
something for the die-hard film buff rather than an evening 's entertainment for popcorn-munching audiences .
german films have a particularly difficult time of it .
while french films are considered fanciful and italian productions passionate , german films are the heavyweights of european cinema , with the reputation of being melancholic and gloomy . that 's perhaps one of the reasons why the market share for german films in north america last year was just a meager 0.15 percent - the equivalent of 2.2 million viewers . the lighter side of cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franka potente starred in the fast-paced tom tykwer film , " run lola run , " which hit cinemas in 1998 .
but the situation is changing , and has been ever since german director tom tykwer 's fast-paced romantic thriller , " run lola run , " became a hit in the u.s. with its innovative plot twists and aesthetic appeal , the movie proved that not all german productions are automatically weighty and intellectual . they can have a good balance of pace and narrative , and still be fun to watch - just like the east-meets-west comedy , " good-bye lenin ! "
wolfgang becker 's film was a surprise success in the u.s. , long surpassing the $ 4 million mark .
and the kitchen-comedy " mostly martha " made twice as much money in the u.s. than in the domestic market . german directors such as wolfgang petersen and roland emmerich are currently taking hollywood by storm with their productions " troy " and " the day after tomorrow . " a lasting trend ? so does this trend have a future , or is it just a short-lived phenomenon ? " i hope that this upsurge will be sustainable , because european stories are of interest to foreign viewers , " said michael schmid-ospach , business manager of the film foundation in the state of north rhine-westphalia . the fact is that there are still huge budget differences between european and american productions .
the average german film costs about the same amount to make as a small american independent production .
and while in germany the director plays a large role in a film 's success , in the u.s. , it 's star power that counts .
" a director only gets the green light from the studios when a famous star signs on , because an a-list celebrity like tom cruise ensures approval of a $ 100 million budget , " said german actor , director and producer , til schweiger . cinematic accolades film festivals can also contribute significantly to a film 's success , said michael weber .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 25.06.2004 euro 2004 gets serious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surprise quarter-finalists greece face zidane & co. on friday the quarter-final stage of the european championship starts on wednesday with the field now cut down to eight teams from sixteen .
dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .

for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .
with italy , bulgaria and sweden in their qualifying group , the danes were written-off as third spot losers before a ball was kicked .
but the fuse on the danish dynamite is fizzing now , even if it has failed to fully ignite .
jon dahl tomasson is gaining confidence with every game and goal and will not fear the czech defense as he and his attacking partners aim to shoot down the tournaments most in-form team .
where the danes could come unstuck is in their own final third of the pitch .
baros , nedved , koller , rosicky and poborski are all on fire and if the czech rearguard can hold , the attacking formation from forwards to maverick midfield should dampen the flame . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official uefa euro 2004 web site all the teams , all the players , all the news from the european soccer championships being held in portugal during june and july .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esfira hegedues , a former slave laborer under the nazi regime , receives a compensation check from karl brozik from the jewish claims conference .
the foundation 's partner organizations had succeeded in documenting more slave labor cases than had been originally estimated .
this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .
some € 14.1 million will go to russian partner foundations .
distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .
earlier compensation payments had been tainted by misuse .
but the board of directors said cooperation with their partner organizations was now going smoothly without any major irregularities in distributing the money .
hans-otto bräutigam , the evz 's newly-elected managing director and former justice minister in the federal state of brandenburg said he was working towards making the efforts of his team more public inside germany . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de judge dismisses nazi compensation suit against german firms a federal judge in the united states dismissed a lawsuit that claimed 17 german companies withheld $ 100 million from a fund for victims of nazi-era forced labor .

if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .

however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .
with italy , bulgaria and sweden in their qualifying group , the danes were written-off as third spot losers before a ball was kicked .
but the fuse on the danish dynamite is fizzing now , even if it has failed to fully ignite .
jon dahl tomasson is gaining confidence with every game and goal and will not fear the czech defense as he and his attacking partners aim to shoot down the tournaments most in-form team .
where the danes could come unstuck is in their own final third of the pitch .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esfira hegedues , a former slave laborer under the nazi regime , receives a compensation check from karl brozik from the jewish claims conference .
the foundation 's partner organizations had succeeded in documenting more slave labor cases than had been originally estimated .
this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .
some € 14.1 million will go to russian partner foundations .
distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .
earlier compensation payments had been tainted by misuse .
but the board of directors said cooperation with their partner organizations was now going smoothly without any major irregularities in distributing the money .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .
with italy , bulgaria and sweden in their qualifying group , the danes were written-off as third spot losers before a ball was kicked .
but the fuse on the danish dynamite is fizzing now , even if it has failed to fully ignite .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .
with italy , bulgaria and sweden in their qualifying group , the danes were written-off as third spot losers before a ball was kicked .
but the fuse on the danish dynamite is fizzing now , even if it has failed to fully ignite .
jon dahl tomasson is gaining confidence with every game and goal and will not fear the czech defense as he and his attacking partners aim to shoot down the tournaments most in-form team .
where the danes could come unstuck is in their own final third of the pitch .

but a german and a nation of greeks have other ideas . no one should still consider greece the surprise package of euro 2004 .

the greeks are here on merit and will enjoy their position while wanting more of the good feeling flowing through the tournament 's underdogs .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .
with italy , bulgaria and sweden in their qualifying group , the danes were written-off as third spot losers before a ball was kicked .
but the fuse on the danish dynamite is fizzing now , even if it has failed to fully ignite .
jon dahl tomasson is gaining confidence with every game and goal and will not fear the czech defense as he and his attacking partners aim to shoot down the tournaments most in-form team .
where the danes could come unstuck is in their own final third of the pitch .
baros , nedved , koller , rosicky and poborski are all on fire and if the czech rearguard can hold , the attacking formation from forwards to maverick midfield should dampen the flame . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official uefa euro 2004 web site all the teams , all the players , all the news from the european soccer championships being held in portugal during june and july .

since early this year , the 25 eu leaders have held many bilateral and secret talks to find the person to replace romano prodi as head of the commission in november .
among those mentioned as possible candidates , not one has been a female .
" it is really a pity that not one single woman is mentioned , " wallström said .
" the appointment must be improved next time . "
according to swedish daily dagens nyheter , the swede would like to see a change in the whole process leading to the appointment of the new head of the commission .
there is no transparency in the process and no general discussion on the qualifications of the candidates has taken place , she pointed out .
" most of us find ourselves completely removed -lsb- from the process -rsb- .
we do not even know who the candidates are , " she said .

the federal administrative court in leipzig said all religions were equally affected by the law in the southern state of baden- württemberg that forbids any political or religious " outward expressions " that may " disturb the peace at school , " the newspaper said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc frosty reaction to eu sugar policy reforms a reform of the eu sugar subsidy regime , due to be unveiled by the european commission next month , has been met with a frosty reception from campaign groups .
ngos have criticized the proposed reforms for not going far enough .
jo leadbeater , head of oxfam international 's eu advocacy office said : " the proposed reform package will not end the dumping of sugar which destroys poor people 's livelihoods . "
in addition the proposal would not increase developing countries ' access to the european market , but would in fact cut the price they receive for their current modest exports to europe .
" this shows that brussels is not listening to developing countries and is not serious about genuine sugar reform , " she said .
eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler is expected next month to propose a cut in guaranteed sugar prices by about one-third by 2007 .
this would make sugar cheaper to european consumers , but not bring the prices down to the world market level .
sugar prices on the eu market are currently two to three times higher than on the world market .

since early this year , the 25 eu leaders have held many bilateral and secret talks to find the person to replace romano prodi as head of the commission in november .
among those mentioned as possible candidates , not one has been a female .
" it is really a pity that not one single woman is mentioned , " wallström said .
" the appointment must be improved next time . "
according to swedish daily dagens nyheter , the swede would like to see a change in the whole process leading to the appointment of the new head of the commission .
there is no transparency in the process and no general discussion on the qualifications of the candidates has taken place , she pointed out .
" most of us find ourselves completely removed -lsb- from the process -rsb- .
we do not even know who the candidates are , " she said .

ngos have criticized the proposed reforms for not going far enough .
jo leadbeater , head of oxfam international 's eu advocacy office said : " the proposed reform package will not end the dumping of sugar which destroys poor people 's livelihoods . "
in addition the proposal would not increase developing countries ' access to the european market , but would in fact cut the price they receive for their current modest exports to europe .
" this shows that brussels is not listening to developing countries and is not serious about genuine sugar reform , " she said .
eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler is expected next month to propose a cut in guaranteed sugar prices by about one-third by 2007 .
this would make sugar cheaper to european consumers , but not bring the prices down to the world market level .
sugar prices on the eu market are currently two to three times higher than on the world market .

jo leadbeater , head of oxfam international 's eu advocacy office said : " the proposed reform package will not end the dumping of sugar which destroys poor people 's livelihoods . "
in addition the proposal would not increase developing countries ' access to the european market , but would in fact cut the price they receive for their current modest exports to europe .
" this shows that brussels is not listening to developing countries and is not serious about genuine sugar reform , " she said .
eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler is expected next month to propose a cut in guaranteed sugar prices by about one-third by 2007 .
this would make sugar cheaper to european consumers , but not bring the prices down to the world market level .
sugar prices on the eu market are currently two to three times higher than on the world market .

according to the financial times , barroso 's relative obscurity in comparison to more high-profile names has helped his chances .
he also fits the bill in that he is a prime minister - eu leaders seems to want to give the post to one of their own - and he comes from a small country which belongs to all of the core europe policies .
however , still counting against him is the fact that he organized the azores summit before the iraq war bringing together u.s. president george w. bush , u.k. prime minister tony blair and josé maría aznar , the former spanish prime minister .
moreover , if he were to be chosen it would open the question of whether the eu should have both a commission president and a foreign policy chief from iberia - as the spaniard javier solana is set to be kept on in his position as the eu 's high representative .
the irish eu presidency continues to say that there is nobody heading the list for romano prodi 's job .
irish prime minister and current eu chief bertie ahern will sound out his colleagues at the nato summit in turkey this weekend .
the name of the person has to be decided before july 22 , when the european parliament is due to give its verdict on the candidate .

the ruling rejected an appeal by a muslim teacher in the southern german state of baden württemberg who had argued that the law impinged upon her religious rights .
in april , the state government in stuttgart enacted a law forbidding headscarves in its schools .
afghan-born fereshda ludin had previously taken her case to germany 's highest court , the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court upheld her right to wear a headscarf , but the judges also gave states the right to pass laws banning headscarves , a move promptly taken by baden württemberg and a handful of other states , which argued the hijab violated the state 's religious neutrality . dw-world.de multicultural symbol or gateway to fundamentalism ?

but a german and a nation of greeks have other ideas . no one should still consider greece the surprise package of euro 2004 .

however , still counting against him is the fact that he organized the azores summit before the iraq war bringing together u.s. president george w. bush , u.k. prime minister tony blair and josé maría aznar , the former spanish prime minister .
moreover , if he were to be chosen it would open the question of whether the eu should have both a commission president and a foreign policy chief from iberia - as the spaniard javier solana is set to be kept on in his position as the eu 's high representative .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .
with italy , bulgaria and sweden in their qualifying group , the danes were written-off as third spot losers before a ball was kicked .
but the fuse on the danish dynamite is fizzing now , even if it has failed to fully ignite .
jon dahl tomasson is gaining confidence with every game and goal and will not fear the czech defense as he and his attacking partners aim to shoot down the tournaments most in-form team .
where the danes could come unstuck is in their own final third of the pitch .

result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .
at their worst , they can both be fractious sides capable of in-fighting and wrecking their own chances .
for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .
it could be full of goals , this one . czech rep v denmark sunday 27 june , dragao , porto denmark is another side which find themselves in a position that few would have thought before the tournament opened .
with italy , bulgaria and sweden in their qualifying group , the danes were written-off as third spot losers before a ball was kicked .
but the fuse on the danish dynamite is fizzing now , even if it has failed to fully ignite .
jon dahl tomasson is gaining confidence with every game and goal and will not fear the czech defense as he and his attacking partners aim to shoot down the tournaments most in-form team .
where the danes could come unstuck is in their own final third of the pitch .
baros , nedved , koller , rosicky and poborski are all on fire and if the czech rearguard can hold , the attacking formation from forwards to maverick midfield should dampen the flame . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official uefa euro 2004 web site all the teams , all the players , all the news from the european soccer championships being held in portugal during june and july . dw-tv europe live motor mobil we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

dw-world casts an eye over the coming games . the european championships enter the knock-out phase this week as the eight teams who survived the group stage fight it out in one-match contests for the four semi-final places .
for these nations , it 's time to get serious .
at the end of each of these quarter-finals , one team will remain - there are no second chances .
portugal v england thursday 24 june , luz , lisbon the hosts take on the improving english in what the portuguese are calling their " second " final after overcoming the " first " against iberian neighbors spain .
if portugal are to progress to a third or even fourth final , they are going to have to deal with an england team which is shedding self-consciousness by the game .
after ditching the pre-occupation with how other teams play , england are now concentrating on how to play their own game and have brought the physical premiership league style to euro 2004 .
however , while the marauding midfield and striking wunderkind wayne rooney may be making all the right headlines so far , england 's mostly pint-sized defense will have to deal with christiano ronaldo and luis figo sending in high crosses and dangerous set-pieces - something england have suffered from so far .
expect this first quarter-final to be of a high tempo .
result : portugal 2-2 england -lrb- after extra-time -rrb- .
portugal win 6-5 on penalties and play the winner of the sweden-holland game in the first semi-final on june 30 .
france v greece friday 25 june , jose alvalade , lisbon the champions have yet to get going and it could be greece who gets the first whipping at the feet of zidane and co. as france look to defend their crown in a manner befitting title holders .
the 3-1 victory over switzerland showed the potential les bleus hold deep inside them to take apart lesser opposition but there was still a lack of consistency and cutting edge .
as the stakes get higher , it could be time for the french to step up a gear or two .
greece should be aware of this fact but should not dwell on it .
the greeks have played with no fear so far and have achieved remarkable , if not surprising , results by doing so .
the quarter-final is unchartered waters for otto rehhagel 's team and is already a milestone in the nation 's soccer history so anything they achieve from now on in will be more than they ever hoped for at euro 2004 .
with no expectations ahead of friday 's clash , greece could play without pressure and if they encounter a lackluster france on the day , who can say that they wo n't cause another shock ? sweden v holland saturday 26 june , faro-loulé two teams with the potential to run amok with attacking flair and tear opponents to pieces , sweden and holland offer the best of european soccer when at their best .

for the dutch , this has been a problem at all of the last few international tournaments they have taken part in but this time , the worst storms have apparently been weathered .
the group stages offered holland with the opportunity to implode but the important win over latvia on tuesday showed a team spirit which has been missing in recent dutch teams .
it may be that the differences have been put aside in time for holland to advance and fulfill their potential .
sweden has shown a resilience to go along with their attacking style and look to be gelling well when they need it most .
they have shown that even when they are behind , the swedes can dig deep without taking pot-shots at each other .
if they remain cool , the swedes can match the flee-flowing dutch by hitting holland with a taste of their own medicine - fast attacks targeting weak links in defense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc portuguese pm tops list for commission president post portuguese prime minister josé manuel durão barroso is emerging as the top contender for commission president .
according to the financial times , barroso 's relative obscurity in comparison to more high-profile names has helped his chances .
he also fits the bill in that he is a prime minister - eu leaders seems to want to give the post to one of their own - and he comes from a small country which belongs to all of the core europe policies .
however , still counting against him is the fact that he organized the azores summit before the iraq war bringing together u.s. president george w. bush , u.k. prime minister tony blair and josé maría aznar , the former spanish prime minister .
moreover , if he were to be chosen it would open the question of whether the eu should have both a commission president and a foreign policy chief from iberia - as the spaniard javier solana is set to be kept on in his position as the eu 's high representative .
the irish eu presidency continues to say that there is nobody heading the list for romano prodi 's job .
irish prime minister and current eu chief bertie ahern will sound out his colleagues at the nato summit in turkey this weekend .
the name of the person has to be decided before july 22 , when the european parliament is due to give its verdict on the candidate .

since early this year , the 25 eu leaders have held many bilateral and secret talks to find the person to replace romano prodi as head of the commission in november .
among those mentioned as possible candidates , not one has been a female .
" it is really a pity that not one single woman is mentioned , " wallström said .
" the appointment must be improved next time . "
according to swedish daily dagens nyheter , the swede would like to see a change in the whole process leading to the appointment of the new head of the commission .
there is no transparency in the process and no general discussion on the qualifications of the candidates has taken place , she pointed out .
" most of us find ourselves completely removed -lsb- from the process -rsb- .
we do not even know who the candidates are , " she said .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .

the foundation 's partner organizations had succeeded in documenting more slave labor cases than had been originally estimated .
this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .
some € 14.1 million will go to russian partner foundations .
distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .
earlier compensation payments had been tainted by misuse .
but the board of directors said cooperation with their partner organizations was now going smoothly without any major irregularities in distributing the money .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esfira hegedues , a former slave laborer under the nazi regime , receives a compensation check from karl brozik from the jewish claims conference .
the foundation 's partner organizations had succeeded in documenting more slave labor cases than had been originally estimated .
this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .
some € 14.1 million will go to russian partner foundations .
distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .
earlier compensation payments had been tainted by misuse .
but the board of directors said cooperation with their partner organizations was now going smoothly without any major irregularities in distributing the money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.06.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc ruling on former nazi officer overturned a german federal court on friday threw out the conviction of a former nazi ss officer known as the " butcher of genoa , " six decades after he ordered the massacre of 59 italian prisoners .
in its ruling , the high court cited the advanced age of 95-year-old defendant friedrich engel .
he had been sentenced in 2002 to seven years in prison for murder in germany 's last major trial of a nazi-era war criminal .
engel and the prosecution had appealed the decision by the lower court in the northern city of hamburg .
the federal judges said that although they upheld the hamburg court 's decision that engel had ordered the executions at a prison in marassi on the outskirts of genoa on may 19 , 1944 , the charge of murder had not been sufficiently proven and would have required a retrial .

since early this year , the 25 eu leaders have held many bilateral and secret talks to find the person to replace romano prodi as head of the commission in november .
among those mentioned as possible candidates , not one has been a female .

" the appointment must be improved next time . "
according to swedish daily dagens nyheter , the swede would like to see a change in the whole process leading to the appointment of the new head of the commission .
there is no transparency in the process and no general discussion on the qualifications of the candidates has taken place , she pointed out .
" most of us find ourselves completely removed -lsb- from the process -rsb- .
we do not even know who the candidates are , " she said .

" was a hit in the u.s. at this year 's media forum in cologne , directors , actors and pr experts discussed how the image of german film in the u.s. is changing from gloomy subject matter for a select few to happier , more mainstream fare . the heart of global cinema beats in hollywood .
romantic tearjerkers , teen comedies , or colourful cartoon adventures - mainstream movies from across the atlantic have long been standard fare in european cinemas . but while blockbusters by spielberg & co. are guaranteed to be big draws at german box offices , the road leading in the opposite direction is much rockier . films from " old europe " are typically seen in the u.s. as sophisticated and demanding .
something for the die-hard film buff rather than an evening 's entertainment for popcorn-munching audiences .
german films have a particularly difficult time of it .
while french films are considered fanciful and italian productions passionate , german films are the heavyweights of european cinema , with the reputation of being melancholic and gloomy . that 's perhaps one of the reasons why the market share for german films in north america last year was just a meager 0.15 percent - the equivalent of 2.2 million viewers . the lighter side of cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franka potente starred in the fast-paced tom tykwer film , " run lola run , " which hit cinemas in 1998 .
but the situation is changing , and has been ever since german director tom tykwer 's fast-paced romantic thriller , " run lola run , " became a hit in the u.s. with its innovative plot twists and aesthetic appeal , the movie proved that not all german productions are automatically weighty and intellectual . they can have a good balance of pace and narrative , and still be fun to watch - just like the east-meets-west comedy , " good-bye lenin ! "
wolfgang becker 's film was a surprise success in the u.s. , long surpassing the $ 4 million mark .
and the kitchen-comedy " mostly martha " made twice as much money in the u.s. than in the domestic market . german directors such as wolfgang petersen and roland emmerich are currently taking hollywood by storm with their productions " troy " and " the day after tomorrow . " a lasting trend ? so does this trend have a future , or is it just a short-lived phenomenon ? " i hope that this upsurge will be sustainable , because european stories are of interest to foreign viewers , " said michael schmid-ospach , business manager of the film foundation in the state of north rhine-westphalia . the fact is that there are still huge budget differences between european and american productions .
the average german film costs about the same amount to make as a small american independent production .
and while in germany the director plays a large role in a film 's success , in the u.s. , it 's star power that counts .
" a director only gets the green light from the studios when a famous star signs on , because an a-list celebrity like tom cruise ensures approval of a $ 100 million budget , " said german actor , director and producer , til schweiger . cinematic accolades film festivals can also contribute significantly to a film 's success , said michael weber .

" anything else , an oscar nomination can work wonders for a film , as was the case with caroline link 's film , " nowhere in africa , " which won the best foreign language film award in 2003 . instead of bringing in the usual $ 1 - $ 2 million , " nowhere in africa " rang up more than $ 6 million in u.s. ticket sales .
an extensive advertising campaign also helped drum up interest in the german wartime drama . marketing is everything american pr expert nichola ellis recommends that german filmmakers learn from u.s. marketing know-how .
a catchy ad campaign that sticks in the public 's mind greatly increases a film 's recognition factor , and with it , box-office sales . unfortunately , such campaigns are in short supply in " old europe . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc frosty reaction to eu sugar policy reforms a reform of the eu sugar subsidy regime , due to be unveiled by the european commission next month , has been met with a frosty reception from campaign groups .
ngos have criticized the proposed reforms for not going far enough .
jo leadbeater , head of oxfam international 's eu advocacy office said : " the proposed reform package will not end the dumping of sugar which destroys poor people 's livelihoods . "
in addition the proposal would not increase developing countries ' access to the european market , but would in fact cut the price they receive for their current modest exports to europe .
" this shows that brussels is not listening to developing countries and is not serious about genuine sugar reform , " she said .
eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler is expected next month to propose a cut in guaranteed sugar prices by about one-third by 2007 .
this would make sugar cheaper to european consumers , but not bring the prices down to the world market level .
sugar prices on the eu market are currently two to three times higher than on the world market .

in its ruling , the high court cited the advanced age of 95-year-old defendant friedrich engel .
he had been sentenced in 2002 to seven years in prison for murder in germany 's last major trial of a nazi-era war criminal .
engel and the prosecution had appealed the decision by the lower court in the northern city of hamburg .
the federal judges said that although they upheld the hamburg court 's decision that engel had ordered the executions at a prison in marassi on the outskirts of genoa on may 19 , 1944 , the charge of murder had not been sufficiently proven and would have required a retrial .
it said that because it could be expected that engel would soon face " significantly diminished ability to stand trial " because of his age , the case must be suspended .

in its ruling , the high court cited the advanced age of 95-year-old defendant friedrich engel .
he had been sentenced in 2002 to seven years in prison for murder in germany 's last major trial of a nazi-era war criminal .
engel and the prosecution had appealed the decision by the lower court in the northern city of hamburg .
the federal judges said that although they upheld the hamburg court 's decision that engel had ordered the executions at a prison in marassi on the outskirts of genoa on may 19 , 1944 , the charge of murder had not been sufficiently proven and would have required a retrial .
it said that because it could be expected that engel would soon face " significantly diminished ability to stand trial " because of his age , the case must be suspended .

in its ruling , the high court cited the advanced age of 95-year-old defendant friedrich engel .
he had been sentenced in 2002 to seven years in prison for murder in germany 's last major trial of a nazi-era war criminal .
engel and the prosecution had appealed the decision by the lower court in the northern city of hamburg .
the federal judges said that although they upheld the hamburg court 's decision that engel had ordered the executions at a prison in marassi on the outskirts of genoa on may 19 , 1944 , the charge of murder had not been sufficiently proven and would have required a retrial .
it said that because it could be expected that engel would soon face " significantly diminished ability to stand trial " because of his age , the case must be suspended .

financial compensation to former holocaust-era forced laborers will be completed ahead of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany next may .
the foundation responsible for the payments is running out of time . the german foundation " erinnerung , verantwortung und zukunft " -lrb- evz -rrb- - or " remembrance , responsibility , and future " - wants to complete the final compensation payments to former slave laborers during the nazi era by mid-2005 .
board of trustees chairman dieter kastrup called the fund 's work " a success story " , as it faced a race against time .
" many victims are now in their seventies and eighties , " he said in berlin on thursday .
the feedback from those who had already received contributions had been overwhelming , he added .
so far , some € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- have been distributed to victims by partner organizations such as the jewish claims conference -lrb- jcc -rrb- and the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- .
most of the 1.6 million recipients concerned live in belarus , poland , russia , ukraine and the czech republic .
extra funds released the board said it will mobilize an additional € 300 million in order to meet a funding shortfall .
this money stems from interest earned on the original settlement with the german government and industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esfira hegedues , a former slave laborer under the nazi regime , receives a compensation check from karl brozik from the jewish claims conference .
the foundation 's partner organizations had succeeded in documenting more slave labor cases than had been originally estimated .
this resulted in a shortage of funds needed to pay former slave laborers the maximum amount allowed under the german law governing the foundation , 15,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 7,669.38 -rrb- .
however , evz said it will have to cut back payments to heirs .
approximately five to 15 percent of former forced and slave laborers can not be compensated because they have died in the meantime or can not be located .
the jcc and the iom will receive the largest share of the funds , € 143.8 million and € 125.6 million , respectively .
the iom is responsible for compensating non-jewish victims outside of central and eastern europe .
some € 14.1 million will go to russian partner foundations .
distribution running smoothly evz was created in 2000 through a joint initiative by german industry and the berlin government .
both contributed € 2.5 billion each for a special fund to compensate former forced and slave laborers during world war ii .
the deal with victims ’ organizations was that german companies contributing to the fund would in the future be safe from additional claims and litigation .
this especially applied to class-action suits against german banks and companies pending in the united states .
earlier compensation payments had been tainted by misuse .
but the board of directors said cooperation with their partner organizations was now going smoothly without any major irregularities in distributing the money .
hans-otto bräutigam , the evz 's newly-elected managing director and former justice minister in the federal state of brandenburg said he was working towards making the efforts of his team more public inside germany . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : judge dismisses nazi compensation suit against german firms a federal judge in the united states dismissed a lawsuit that claimed 17 german companies withheld $ 100 million from a fund for victims of nazi-era forced labor .

mr westwood has refused to quit after a damning report into the soham murders , despite home secretary david blunkett 's orders for his suspension .
the bichard report said the force had made " deeply shocking errors " in vetting checks on killer ian huntley .
the authority will be acting illegally if it refuses to suspend mr westwood . "
i owe it to the officers and staff of humberside police , to the public of humberside and to the families of holly and jessica to complete the task " chief constable david westwood but on tuesday , just a few hours after mr blunkett told the commons he was using new powers to make humberside police authority suspend mr westwood , the chief constable hit back .
he said he had made a " personal commitment " to " do his utmost " to stay in charge and make improvements to the force .
" i owe it to the officers and staff of humberside police , to the public of humberside and to the families of holly and jessica to complete the task . "
' strong language ' police minister hazel blears joined the row on thursday when she urged mr westwood to consider his position .
she said : " they -lsb- the authority -rsb- will meet on friday and take it from there .
clearly the bichard report used quite strong language and the issue is about public confidence . "
but some feel that mr westwood is being made a scapegoat . "
i think both sides are at fault - bichard makes that clear and it would be nice and refreshing if both sides would take responsibility " mark oaten lib dem home affairs spokesman liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said he accepted mr westwood should resign over the force 's failings but he also thought the home office should take responsibility for its mistakes .
he told radio 4 's today programme : " there is an extent to which the heat is being put on a chief constable , i suspect for political reasons , because the home office itself is under some criticism in this report .
" i think both sides are at fault .
bichard makes that clear and it would be nice and refreshing if both sides would take responsibility . "
string of allegations sir michael bichard 's report said mr westwood should take " personal , as well as corporate responsibility " for not addressing the force 's failings when he became chief constable in 1999 .
the force 's failure to keep proper records allowed huntley to get a school caretaker 's job in soham , where he murdered 10-year-old pupils holly wells and jessica chapman .
he was able to take the job despite a string of sex allegations against him .

the scottish prisons complaints commission said many facilities were " desperately in need of upgrading " , with overcrowding the biggest problem .
the increase in prisoner numbers has brought an increase in complaints .
the sps took too long and did too little to tackle the issues being raised by inmates , the report said .
' alarming rate ' in his annual report , commissioner vaughan barrett criticised the sps for not accepting enough of his recommendations .
he also said it was unfortunate that the sps took " lengthy periods of time " to respond to issues raised .
however mr barrett accepted a number of factors which had put the sps under strain .
in his report , which covers the period between 1 april , 2003 , and 31 march , 2004 , he said the prison population had continued to grow " at an alarming rate " .
overcrowding has arguably become the single most problematic factor in maintaining order and security in scottish prisons vaughan barrett spcc the average daily prisoner count reached a " staggering " record 7,074 inmates across scotland 's 17 prisons in march 2004 , he said .
" overcrowding has arguably become the single most problematic factor in maintaining order and security in scottish prisons , " mr barrett said .
" it places enormous stress on the prisoner population and the finite resources of the sps . "
the report showed the number of complaints received by the commission had more than doubled from the 217 made in 1995 to the 441 received in the year 2003/04 .
the spcc provides an independent review for prisoner complaints that have not been resolved through the internal sps complaints system .
if the commission accepts a complaint , efforts are made to resolve the issue at a local level .
human rights in cases where the complaint remains unresolved , the spcc will make a formal recommendation to the chief executive of the prison service that remedial action be taken .
the report noted an " increased prisoner awareness " of human rights issues as being partly responsible for the increase in complaints , with the " large number " of complaints citing violations of the european convention on human rights placing a further strain on prison resources .
among the topics for complaint among scottish prisoners were treatment by staff , visiting issues and bullying and victimisation .
the report also singled out peterhead prison for particular criticism , revealing the commission had received an " inordinate " number of complaints from its prisoners .
there was an increased awareness of rights almost a third of the total number of complaints came from peterhead prison , the report showed .
" the volume of complaints suggest that peterhead 's circumstances create unique and difficult problems for prisoners , " mr barrett said .
he noted that , until recently , many cells at the aberdeenshire prison had been without power and also detailed several incidences of two prisoners sharing a cell designed to hold just one person .
the report highlighted a shortage of trained staff to provide specialised programmes to long-term sex offenders being held at peterhead .
and , condemning the sanitary regime at peterhead , he noted " the facility itself is in need of dire upgrading " .

the scottish prisons complaints commission said many facilities were " desperately in need of upgrading " , with overcrowding the biggest problem .
the increase in prisoner numbers has brought an increase in complaints .
the sps took too long and did too little to tackle the issues being raised by inmates , the report said .
' alarming rate ' in his annual report , commissioner vaughan barrett criticised the sps for not accepting enough of his recommendations .
he also said it was unfortunate that the sps took " lengthy periods of time " to respond to issues raised .
however mr barrett accepted a number of factors which had put the sps under strain .
in his report , which covers the period between 1 april , 2003 , and 31 march , 2004 , he said the prison population had continued to grow " at an alarming rate " .
overcrowding has arguably become the single most problematic factor in maintaining order and security in scottish prisons vaughan barrett spcc the average daily prisoner count reached a " staggering " record 7,074 inmates across scotland 's 17 prisons in march 2004 , he said .
" overcrowding has arguably become the single most problematic factor in maintaining order and security in scottish prisons , " mr barrett said .
" it places enormous stress on the prisoner population and the finite resources of the sps . "
the report showed the number of complaints received by the commission had more than doubled from the 217 made in 1995 to the 441 received in the year 2003/04 .
the spcc provides an independent review for prisoner complaints that have not been resolved through the internal sps complaints system .
if the commission accepts a complaint , efforts are made to resolve the issue at a local level .
human rights in cases where the complaint remains unresolved , the spcc will make a formal recommendation to the chief executive of the prison service that remedial action be taken .
the report noted an " increased prisoner awareness " of human rights issues as being partly responsible for the increase in complaints , with the " large number " of complaints citing violations of the european convention on human rights placing a further strain on prison resources .
among the topics for complaint among scottish prisoners were treatment by staff , visiting issues and bullying and victimisation .
the report also singled out peterhead prison for particular criticism , revealing the commission had received an " inordinate " number of complaints from its prisoners .
there was an increased awareness of rights almost a third of the total number of complaints came from peterhead prison , the report showed .
" the volume of complaints suggest that peterhead 's circumstances create unique and difficult problems for prisoners , " mr barrett said .
he noted that , until recently , many cells at the aberdeenshire prison had been without power and also detailed several incidences of two prisoners sharing a cell designed to hold just one person .
the report highlighted a shortage of trained staff to provide specialised programmes to long-term sex offenders being held at peterhead .
and , condemning the sanitary regime at peterhead , he noted " the facility itself is in need of dire upgrading " .

first cymru has been conducting the first welsh trials of an electric bus that produces just a twentieth of the harmful emissions of normal buses .
the electocity hybrid bus has found some of the city 's steeper hills a bit of a challenge but it could be running on the flatter routes by 2006 .
passengers who climbed on board this week gave it the thumbs-up and said they would like to see more introduced as soon as possible .
christine brown said : " it 's a very good idea .
" it 's a nice airy bus and there are no smells like the other buses , which i guess is because of the emissions .
" it 's also a lot quieter but other than that you would not notice the difference from other buses . "
fellow passenger alex combe said : " it 's obviously a smoother ride because you 've not got the petrol or diesel engine .
" it 's first class for the city and the environment . "
student mike hoskins was also full of praise .
he said : " i think it 's a really good idea , especially for helping the environment .
" it 's just like a normal bus but maybe quieter . "
the prototype seen on swansea 's roads this week is made by the wright group which aims to go into full production next year .
managing director maurice perl explained the hybrid electric engine incorporates a gas turbine generator and batteries .
" if clean buses can be produced we are going to encourage more people to take the bus , " he said .
" this bus is twenty times cleaner than a normal bus and as near to zero emissions as you are going to get .
" there are something over 120 air quality areas in the uk - what that means is the air quality is not good enough to pass eu standards being introduced in 2005 . "
one of these is the hafod area of swansea , he said .
" if there are clean buses around the chances are councils are going to be looking at banning cars and other vehicles in certain parts of city centres . "
mr perl said drivers also felt it was less stressful behind the drive .
steve bodley , who has been behind the wheel for most of the week , agreed .
" it takes a bit of getting use to but it 's not that different , " he said .
" it 's a littler slow on the hills but it is a lot quieter - it 's a nice drive . "
first cymru managing director justin davies said the buses may be on the streets in swansea full-time from 2006 or 2007 .
" people are more aware of the environment these days and i think people will only become more concerned about what 's being pumped into the environment in the future , " he said .
" twenty or even 10 years you would not have thought we would all go down to the recycling plant every saturday morning with our bottles and cans .
" using clean buses and cars may well be another environmental choice people make in the future . "

carl budden of the rda said : " in the last five years , we 've already spent something like £ 15m .
" we have a similar amount committed to repairing the mills and bakery section of the yard , plus repairs to improving the public areas of the yard . "
' driving out locals ' the rda hopes that the revamped yard will become an important asset for the city .
however , this confidence is not necessarily shared by local people .
one nearby resident said of the apartments being built : " if you can afford it , that 's all and well .
but sometimes it 's driving out the local people because they ca n't afford it . "
carl budden of the rda said : " i know people are concerned about the amount of money that has been spent , but we need to understand the condition of the buildings and the infrastructure .
" after 150 years , it requires an enormous amount of investment to renew and repair parts of it . "
however , if the yard eventually achieves for plymouth what the eden project has done for cornwall , the doubters could yet be silenced .
the overall project at the yard , which was designed by sir john rennie in 1824 , is due to be completed by the end of 2005 .

a report by the children 's charity nch has also found that many low income families in northern ireland can not afford a healthy diet .
a lack of money sometimes makes it impossible for parents to feed their children healthily , the report found .
one in five parents said they simply do not have enough money for food .
the report , carried out by the food commission for nch also found that the cost of a large healthy food basket in the province is 6 % more than for the unhealthy equivalent .
the government must make healthy food affordable to low income families ross mccrea nch northern ireland the going hungry document suggests it is almost impossible for parents on low incomes to afford to feed their children with nutritious food .
ross mccrea , nch policy office for northern ireland said the recent worries over obesity in young children had placed a lot of blame with parents .
" it is right to be concerned about rising levels of childhood obesity , " he said .
" but nch 's report shows that it is unfair to place all the blame on parents and children .
" the comparatively high cost of healthy food and sophisticated marketing used to encourage children to eat junk food are also significant factors .
" the government needs to do much , much more if it is to put healthy food within the reach of children . "
other findings of the going hungry report found that 35 % of parents surveyed lived more than two miles from a supermarket and that getting to and from the shops added to extra expense on top of their average food bill .
the charity has called on the government to develop a national action plan to stamp out food poverty .
they are campaigning for more free or subsidised transport schemes to supermarkets and want only healthy food and drink available in schools .
