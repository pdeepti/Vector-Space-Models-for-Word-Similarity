what kind of quality of life , health , and care can the elderly expect in germany ? the number of senior citizens in germany is growing all the time - and germans are also living longer .
in less than 50 years ' time , 12 percent of the population will be over 80 , and scientists estimate that by the year 2050 , the life expectancy of the average german will have increased by a decade . so what is life like for germany 's ever-expanding ranks of senior citizens ? the threat of ageism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ageism is a common problem in the workplace for those still working , getting old is n't much fun .
otto wulff , chairman of germany 's senior citizens ' union , is currently planning to bring a constitutional case against the increasing discrimination against senior citizens in the workplace . only 35 percent of 55 to 65 year-olds in germany still work - half the number of working senior citizens in switzerland , scandinavia and the us . wulff argues it 's germany 's loss . " top class academics and scientists are relocating abroad .
germany ca n't afford to lose these people , " he said . pensions hardship ? meanwhile , franz ruland , ceo of the german association of pension insurers , said he is worried that the country might soon witness a rise in poverty among the elderly .
in an interview with german daily die welt , he said the long-term unemployed are paying too little into pension schemes , which will lead to later hardship . " particularly in the eastern states , widespread unemployment is going to lead to some serious problems , " he pointed out . moreover , berlin 's efforts to combat economic stagnation have included cutting pension payments .
amid expert predictions that the percentage of the nation 's working population aged 65 and over will reach more than 35 percent by 2030 , the level of retirement pensions was frozen in 2004 as a part of the government 's economic reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , pensioners took to the streets to protest welfare cuts the move was designed to help the government plug a shortfall of some € 10.3 million -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- in state pension funds , caused by the ever-ageing population and fewer contributions to the fund due to high unemployment .
needless to say , the decision met with strong resistance from germany 's 20 million pensioners .
quality care but for the lucky ones , living to a ripe old age is rewarded with state-assured , quality of life care - unlike in days gone by .
ingrid espeter is director of the barbara von renthe fink old age home .
she can remember what life was like for the elderly members of her family , some 30 years back . " one aunt lived in a hall with 12 demented women , " she said .
" one of them always screamed and another just laid around like a zombie .
it was a horrible atmosphere . " much has changed since then . " older people are no longer neglected in old age homes , " espeter said .
" now they 're well taken care of , kept active and entertained .
there are many activities on offer ; music therapy , cooking groups , ferry trips , and many more things to keep seniors stimulated and happy .
these programs are obligatory if a home wants to receive state subsidies . " a life of leisure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pensioners discover the joys of travel late in life heinz freimuth retired from his job five years ago , and is more active than ever .
at 66 , he runs marathons , is an avid theater goer , offers counselling to other seniors at the local city hall , and makes time for his children and grandchildren . he claims the favorite pastime for older germans is not sport or culture , but travel . " lots of seniors collect a very generous pension , " he pointed out .
" they can take fantastic trips around the world , to south africa , america , new zealand .
when my generation is no longer around , billions of euro will be inherited . " many in germany complain that while the rest of the country is tightening its belt , old people have never had it so good .
but the older generation says it deserves a break . " my generation saved a lot of money for old age , " freimuth said .
" the majority of people between 60 and 80 have a lot of money at their disposal .
i see it in our closer circle of friends .
they buy new cars , and have more than one , own real estate , and take luxurious vacations . " future generations face uncertain old age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of retired people choose to move to a senior citizens ' home rather than live alone for seniors needing minimal assistance , the state can provide home-care workers who visit anywhere from once a week to a few times a day , to aid in medicine-taking , meals , grooming , shopping and cleaning . high unemployment has also prompted many families to care for their parents themselves , for which they are compensated with a few hundred euro per month by the state .
there are also special state-subsidized senior residences : apartments blocks or rooms exclusively for seniors with on-the-premises 24 hour emergency service , as well as a multitude of high quality old age homes for those needing constant care . but the real question is whether the high standard of care enjoyed by senior citizens today be available for the generations to come ? " it will be a financial problem , " espeter said .
" the high standard of care we have now will not be possible in the future , because more personnel will be needed .

now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .
but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .
the largely german crew would take their newly learned skills and apply them to their next project in germany , he pointed out . regardless of differences , both sides agree on one thing : european films - of ever-improving quality - are gaining a higher international profile .
on saturday , the european film academy based in barcelona will honor the cream of the crop at its annual european film prize awards .

now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .
but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .
the largely german crew would take their newly learned skills and apply them to their next project in germany , he pointed out . regardless of differences , both sides agree on one thing : european films - of ever-improving quality - are gaining a higher international profile .

but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .
the largely german crew would take their newly learned skills and apply them to their next project in germany , he pointed out . regardless of differences , both sides agree on one thing : european films - of ever-improving quality - are gaining a higher international profile .
on saturday , the european film academy based in barcelona will honor the cream of the crop at its annual european film prize awards .

what kind of quality of life , health , and care can the elderly expect in germany ? the number of senior citizens in germany is growing all the time - and germans are also living longer .
in less than 50 years ' time , 12 percent of the population will be over 80 , and scientists estimate that by the year 2050 , the life expectancy of the average german will have increased by a decade . so what is life like for germany 's ever-expanding ranks of senior citizens ? the threat of ageism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ageism is a common problem in the workplace for those still working , getting old is n't much fun .
otto wulff , chairman of germany 's senior citizens ' union , is currently planning to bring a constitutional case against the increasing discrimination against senior citizens in the workplace . only 35 percent of 55 to 65 year-olds in germany still work - half the number of working senior citizens in switzerland , scandinavia and the us . wulff argues it 's germany 's loss . " top class academics and scientists are relocating abroad .
germany ca n't afford to lose these people , " he said . pensions hardship ? meanwhile , franz ruland , ceo of the german association of pension insurers , said he is worried that the country might soon witness a rise in poverty among the elderly .
in an interview with german daily die welt , he said the long-term unemployed are paying too little into pension schemes , which will lead to later hardship . " particularly in the eastern states , widespread unemployment is going to lead to some serious problems , " he pointed out . moreover , berlin 's efforts to combat economic stagnation have included cutting pension payments .
amid expert predictions that the percentage of the nation 's working population aged 65 and over will reach more than 35 percent by 2030 , the level of retirement pensions was frozen in 2004 as a part of the government 's economic reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , pensioners took to the streets to protest welfare cuts the move was designed to help the government plug a shortfall of some € 10.3 million -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- in state pension funds , caused by the ever-ageing population and fewer contributions to the fund due to high unemployment .
needless to say , the decision met with strong resistance from germany 's 20 million pensioners .
quality care but for the lucky ones , living to a ripe old age is rewarded with state-assured , quality of life care - unlike in days gone by .
ingrid espeter is director of the barbara von renthe fink old age home .
she can remember what life was like for the elderly members of her family , some 30 years back . " one aunt lived in a hall with 12 demented women , " she said .
" one of them always screamed and another just laid around like a zombie .
it was a horrible atmosphere . " much has changed since then . " older people are no longer neglected in old age homes , " espeter said .
" now they 're well taken care of , kept active and entertained .
there are many activities on offer ; music therapy , cooking groups , ferry trips , and many more things to keep seniors stimulated and happy .
these programs are obligatory if a home wants to receive state subsidies . " a life of leisure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pensioners discover the joys of travel late in life heinz freimuth retired from his job five years ago , and is more active than ever .
at 66 , he runs marathons , is an avid theater goer , offers counselling to other seniors at the local city hall , and makes time for his children and grandchildren . he claims the favorite pastime for older germans is not sport or culture , but travel . " lots of seniors collect a very generous pension , " he pointed out .
" they can take fantastic trips around the world , to south africa , america , new zealand .
when my generation is no longer around , billions of euro will be inherited . " many in germany complain that while the rest of the country is tightening its belt , old people have never had it so good .
but the older generation says it deserves a break . " my generation saved a lot of money for old age , " freimuth said .
" the majority of people between 60 and 80 have a lot of money at their disposal .
i see it in our closer circle of friends .
they buy new cars , and have more than one , own real estate , and take luxurious vacations . " future generations face uncertain old age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of retired people choose to move to a senior citizens ' home rather than live alone for seniors needing minimal assistance , the state can provide home-care workers who visit anywhere from once a week to a few times a day , to aid in medicine-taking , meals , grooming , shopping and cleaning . high unemployment has also prompted many families to care for their parents themselves , for which they are compensated with a few hundred euro per month by the state .
there are also special state-subsidized senior residences : apartments blocks or rooms exclusively for seniors with on-the-premises 24 hour emergency service , as well as a multitude of high quality old age homes for those needing constant care . but the real question is whether the high standard of care enjoyed by senior citizens today be available for the generations to come ? " it will be a financial problem , " espeter said .
" the high standard of care we have now will not be possible in the future , because more personnel will be needed .

now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .
but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .
the largely german crew would take their newly learned skills and apply them to their next project in germany , he pointed out . regardless of differences , both sides agree on one thing : european films - of ever-improving quality - are gaining a higher international profile .
on saturday , the european film academy based in barcelona will honor the cream of the crop at its annual european film prize awards .

what kind of quality of life , health , and care can the elderly expect in germany ? the number of senior citizens in germany is growing all the time - and germans are also living longer .
in less than 50 years ' time , 12 percent of the population will be over 80 , and scientists estimate that by the year 2050 , the life expectancy of the average german will have increased by a decade . so what is life like for germany 's ever-expanding ranks of senior citizens ? the threat of ageism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ageism is a common problem in the workplace for those still working , getting old is n't much fun .
otto wulff , chairman of germany 's senior citizens ' union , is currently planning to bring a constitutional case against the increasing discrimination against senior citizens in the workplace . only 35 percent of 55 to 65 year-olds in germany still work - half the number of working senior citizens in switzerland , scandinavia and the us . wulff argues it 's germany 's loss . " top class academics and scientists are relocating abroad .
germany ca n't afford to lose these people , " he said . pensions hardship ? meanwhile , franz ruland , ceo of the german association of pension insurers , said he is worried that the country might soon witness a rise in poverty among the elderly .
in an interview with german daily die welt , he said the long-term unemployed are paying too little into pension schemes , which will lead to later hardship . " particularly in the eastern states , widespread unemployment is going to lead to some serious problems , " he pointed out . moreover , berlin 's efforts to combat economic stagnation have included cutting pension payments .
amid expert predictions that the percentage of the nation 's working population aged 65 and over will reach more than 35 percent by 2030 , the level of retirement pensions was frozen in 2004 as a part of the government 's economic reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , pensioners took to the streets to protest welfare cuts the move was designed to help the government plug a shortfall of some € 10.3 million -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- in state pension funds , caused by the ever-ageing population and fewer contributions to the fund due to high unemployment .
needless to say , the decision met with strong resistance from germany 's 20 million pensioners .
quality care but for the lucky ones , living to a ripe old age is rewarded with state-assured , quality of life care - unlike in days gone by .
ingrid espeter is director of the barbara von renthe fink old age home .
she can remember what life was like for the elderly members of her family , some 30 years back . " one aunt lived in a hall with 12 demented women , " she said .
" one of them always screamed and another just laid around like a zombie .
it was a horrible atmosphere . " much has changed since then . " older people are no longer neglected in old age homes , " espeter said .
" now they 're well taken care of , kept active and entertained .
there are many activities on offer ; music therapy , cooking groups , ferry trips , and many more things to keep seniors stimulated and happy .
these programs are obligatory if a home wants to receive state subsidies . " a life of leisure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pensioners discover the joys of travel late in life heinz freimuth retired from his job five years ago , and is more active than ever .
at 66 , he runs marathons , is an avid theater goer , offers counselling to other seniors at the local city hall , and makes time for his children and grandchildren . he claims the favorite pastime for older germans is not sport or culture , but travel . " lots of seniors collect a very generous pension , " he pointed out .
" they can take fantastic trips around the world , to south africa , america , new zealand .
when my generation is no longer around , billions of euro will be inherited . " many in germany complain that while the rest of the country is tightening its belt , old people have never had it so good .
but the older generation says it deserves a break . " my generation saved a lot of money for old age , " freimuth said .
" the majority of people between 60 and 80 have a lot of money at their disposal .
i see it in our closer circle of friends .
they buy new cars , and have more than one , own real estate , and take luxurious vacations . " future generations face uncertain old age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of retired people choose to move to a senior citizens ' home rather than live alone for seniors needing minimal assistance , the state can provide home-care workers who visit anywhere from once a week to a few times a day , to aid in medicine-taking , meals , grooming , shopping and cleaning . high unemployment has also prompted many families to care for their parents themselves , for which they are compensated with a few hundred euro per month by the state .
there are also special state-subsidized senior residences : apartments blocks or rooms exclusively for seniors with on-the-premises 24 hour emergency service , as well as a multitude of high quality old age homes for those needing constant care . but the real question is whether the high standard of care enjoyed by senior citizens today be available for the generations to come ? " it will be a financial problem , " espeter said .
" the high standard of care we have now will not be possible in the future , because more personnel will be needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2005 berlin film festival set for scandal a bumper year for german film the best of germany 's silver screen berlinale joins european big three culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.12.2004 eu boosts home-grown filmmakers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french film " amelie " was a global hit in 2001 due to an eu initiative that promotes films abroad , european films are increasingly popular .
now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .
but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .
the largely german crew would take their newly learned skills and apply them to their next project in germany , he pointed out . regardless of differences , both sides agree on one thing : european films - of ever-improving quality - are gaining a higher international profile .
on saturday , the european film academy based in barcelona will honor the cream of the crop at its annual european film prize awards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2005 berlin film festival set for scandal a bumper year for german film the best of germany 's silver screen berlinale joins european big three culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.12.2004 eu boosts home-grown filmmakers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french film " amelie " was a global hit in 2001 due to an eu initiative that promotes films abroad , european films are increasingly popular .
now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .
but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .
the largely german crew would take their newly learned skills and apply them to their next project in germany , he pointed out . regardless of differences , both sides agree on one thing : european films - of ever-improving quality - are gaining a higher international profile .
on saturday , the european film academy based in barcelona will honor the cream of the crop at its annual european film prize awards .

now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .
but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .
the largely german crew would take their newly learned skills and apply them to their next project in germany , he pointed out . regardless of differences , both sides agree on one thing : european films - of ever-improving quality - are gaining a higher international profile .

what kind of quality of life , health , and care can the elderly expect in germany ? the number of senior citizens in germany is growing all the time - and germans are also living longer .
in less than 50 years ' time , 12 percent of the population will be over 80 , and scientists estimate that by the year 2050 , the life expectancy of the average german will have increased by a decade . so what is life like for germany 's ever-expanding ranks of senior citizens ? the threat of ageism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ageism is a common problem in the workplace for those still working , getting old is n't much fun .
otto wulff , chairman of germany 's senior citizens ' union , is currently planning to bring a constitutional case against the increasing discrimination against senior citizens in the workplace . only 35 percent of 55 to 65 year-olds in germany still work - half the number of working senior citizens in switzerland , scandinavia and the us . wulff argues it 's germany 's loss . " top class academics and scientists are relocating abroad .
germany ca n't afford to lose these people , " he said . pensions hardship ? meanwhile , franz ruland , ceo of the german association of pension insurers , said he is worried that the country might soon witness a rise in poverty among the elderly .
in an interview with german daily die welt , he said the long-term unemployed are paying too little into pension schemes , which will lead to later hardship . " particularly in the eastern states , widespread unemployment is going to lead to some serious problems , " he pointed out . moreover , berlin 's efforts to combat economic stagnation have included cutting pension payments .
amid expert predictions that the percentage of the nation 's working population aged 65 and over will reach more than 35 percent by 2030 , the level of retirement pensions was frozen in 2004 as a part of the government 's economic reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , pensioners took to the streets to protest welfare cuts the move was designed to help the government plug a shortfall of some € 10.3 million -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- in state pension funds , caused by the ever-ageing population and fewer contributions to the fund due to high unemployment .
needless to say , the decision met with strong resistance from germany 's 20 million pensioners .
quality care but for the lucky ones , living to a ripe old age is rewarded with state-assured , quality of life care - unlike in days gone by .
ingrid espeter is director of the barbara von renthe fink old age home .
she can remember what life was like for the elderly members of her family , some 30 years back . " one aunt lived in a hall with 12 demented women , " she said .
" one of them always screamed and another just laid around like a zombie .
it was a horrible atmosphere . " much has changed since then . " older people are no longer neglected in old age homes , " espeter said .
" now they 're well taken care of , kept active and entertained .
there are many activities on offer ; music therapy , cooking groups , ferry trips , and many more things to keep seniors stimulated and happy .
these programs are obligatory if a home wants to receive state subsidies . " a life of leisure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pensioners discover the joys of travel late in life heinz freimuth retired from his job five years ago , and is more active than ever .
at 66 , he runs marathons , is an avid theater goer , offers counselling to other seniors at the local city hall , and makes time for his children and grandchildren . he claims the favorite pastime for older germans is not sport or culture , but travel . " lots of seniors collect a very generous pension , " he pointed out .
" they can take fantastic trips around the world , to south africa , america , new zealand .
when my generation is no longer around , billions of euro will be inherited . " many in germany complain that while the rest of the country is tightening its belt , old people have never had it so good .
but the older generation says it deserves a break . " my generation saved a lot of money for old age , " freimuth said .
" the majority of people between 60 and 80 have a lot of money at their disposal .
i see it in our closer circle of friends .
they buy new cars , and have more than one , own real estate , and take luxurious vacations . " future generations face uncertain old age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of retired people choose to move to a senior citizens ' home rather than live alone for seniors needing minimal assistance , the state can provide home-care workers who visit anywhere from once a week to a few times a day , to aid in medicine-taking , meals , grooming , shopping and cleaning . high unemployment has also prompted many families to care for their parents themselves , for which they are compensated with a few hundred euro per month by the state .
there are also special state-subsidized senior residences : apartments blocks or rooms exclusively for seniors with on-the-premises 24 hour emergency service , as well as a multitude of high quality old age homes for those needing constant care . but the real question is whether the high standard of care enjoyed by senior citizens today be available for the generations to come ? " it will be a financial problem , " espeter said .
" the high standard of care we have now will not be possible in the future , because more personnel will be needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2005 berlin film festival set for scandal a bumper year for german film the best of germany 's silver screen berlinale joins european big three culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.12.2004 eu boosts home-grown filmmakers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french film " amelie " was a global hit in 2001 due to an eu initiative that promotes films abroad , european films are increasingly popular .
now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .
but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .

now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .

as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .

now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .
but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .

what kind of quality of life , health , and care can the elderly expect in germany ? the number of senior citizens in germany is growing all the time - and germans are also living longer .
in less than 50 years ' time , 12 percent of the population will be over 80 , and scientists estimate that by the year 2050 , the life expectancy of the average german will have increased by a decade . so what is life like for germany 's ever-expanding ranks of senior citizens ? the threat of ageism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ageism is a common problem in the workplace for those still working , getting old is n't much fun .
otto wulff , chairman of germany 's senior citizens ' union , is currently planning to bring a constitutional case against the increasing discrimination against senior citizens in the workplace . only 35 percent of 55 to 65 year-olds in germany still work - half the number of working senior citizens in switzerland , scandinavia and the us . wulff argues it 's germany 's loss . " top class academics and scientists are relocating abroad .
germany ca n't afford to lose these people , " he said . pensions hardship ? meanwhile , franz ruland , ceo of the german association of pension insurers , said he is worried that the country might soon witness a rise in poverty among the elderly .
in an interview with german daily die welt , he said the long-term unemployed are paying too little into pension schemes , which will lead to later hardship . " particularly in the eastern states , widespread unemployment is going to lead to some serious problems , " he pointed out . moreover , berlin 's efforts to combat economic stagnation have included cutting pension payments .
amid expert predictions that the percentage of the nation 's working population aged 65 and over will reach more than 35 percent by 2030 , the level of retirement pensions was frozen in 2004 as a part of the government 's economic reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , pensioners took to the streets to protest welfare cuts the move was designed to help the government plug a shortfall of some € 10.3 million -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- in state pension funds , caused by the ever-ageing population and fewer contributions to the fund due to high unemployment .
needless to say , the decision met with strong resistance from germany 's 20 million pensioners .
quality care but for the lucky ones , living to a ripe old age is rewarded with state-assured , quality of life care - unlike in days gone by .
ingrid espeter is director of the barbara von renthe fink old age home .
she can remember what life was like for the elderly members of her family , some 30 years back . " one aunt lived in a hall with 12 demented women , " she said .
" one of them always screamed and another just laid around like a zombie .
it was a horrible atmosphere . " much has changed since then . " older people are no longer neglected in old age homes , " espeter said .
" now they 're well taken care of , kept active and entertained .
there are many activities on offer ; music therapy , cooking groups , ferry trips , and many more things to keep seniors stimulated and happy .
these programs are obligatory if a home wants to receive state subsidies . " a life of leisure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pensioners discover the joys of travel late in life heinz freimuth retired from his job five years ago , and is more active than ever .
at 66 , he runs marathons , is an avid theater goer , offers counselling to other seniors at the local city hall , and makes time for his children and grandchildren . he claims the favorite pastime for older germans is not sport or culture , but travel . " lots of seniors collect a very generous pension , " he pointed out .
" they can take fantastic trips around the world , to south africa , america , new zealand .
when my generation is no longer around , billions of euro will be inherited . " many in germany complain that while the rest of the country is tightening its belt , old people have never had it so good .
but the older generation says it deserves a break . " my generation saved a lot of money for old age , " freimuth said .
" the majority of people between 60 and 80 have a lot of money at their disposal .
i see it in our closer circle of friends .
they buy new cars , and have more than one , own real estate , and take luxurious vacations . " future generations face uncertain old age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of retired people choose to move to a senior citizens ' home rather than live alone for seniors needing minimal assistance , the state can provide home-care workers who visit anywhere from once a week to a few times a day , to aid in medicine-taking , meals , grooming , shopping and cleaning . high unemployment has also prompted many families to care for their parents themselves , for which they are compensated with a few hundred euro per month by the state .
there are also special state-subsidized senior residences : apartments blocks or rooms exclusively for seniors with on-the-premises 24 hour emergency service , as well as a multitude of high quality old age homes for those needing constant care . but the real question is whether the high standard of care enjoyed by senior citizens today be available for the generations to come ? " it will be a financial problem , " espeter said .
" the high standard of care we have now will not be possible in the future , because more personnel will be needed .

otto wulff , chairman of germany 's senior citizens ' union , is currently planning to bring a constitutional case against the increasing discrimination against senior citizens in the workplace . only 35 percent of 55 to 65 year-olds in germany still work - half the number of working senior citizens in switzerland , scandinavia and the us . wulff argues it 's germany 's loss . " top class academics and scientists are relocating abroad .
germany ca n't afford to lose these people , " he said . pensions hardship ? meanwhile , franz ruland , ceo of the german association of pension insurers , said he is worried that the country might soon witness a rise in poverty among the elderly .
in an interview with german daily die welt , he said the long-term unemployed are paying too little into pension schemes , which will lead to later hardship . " particularly in the eastern states , widespread unemployment is going to lead to some serious problems , " he pointed out . moreover , berlin 's efforts to combat economic stagnation have included cutting pension payments .
amid expert predictions that the percentage of the nation 's working population aged 65 and over will reach more than 35 percent by 2030 , the level of retirement pensions was frozen in 2004 as a part of the government 's economic reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , pensioners took to the streets to protest welfare cuts the move was designed to help the government plug a shortfall of some € 10.3 million -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- in state pension funds , caused by the ever-ageing population and fewer contributions to the fund due to high unemployment .
needless to say , the decision met with strong resistance from germany 's 20 million pensioners .
quality care but for the lucky ones , living to a ripe old age is rewarded with state-assured , quality of life care - unlike in days gone by .
ingrid espeter is director of the barbara von renthe fink old age home .
she can remember what life was like for the elderly members of her family , some 30 years back . " one aunt lived in a hall with 12 demented women , " she said .
" one of them always screamed and another just laid around like a zombie .
it was a horrible atmosphere . " much has changed since then . " older people are no longer neglected in old age homes , " espeter said .
" now they 're well taken care of , kept active and entertained .
there are many activities on offer ; music therapy , cooking groups , ferry trips , and many more things to keep seniors stimulated and happy .
these programs are obligatory if a home wants to receive state subsidies . " a life of leisure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pensioners discover the joys of travel late in life heinz freimuth retired from his job five years ago , and is more active than ever .
at 66 , he runs marathons , is an avid theater goer , offers counselling to other seniors at the local city hall , and makes time for his children and grandchildren . he claims the favorite pastime for older germans is not sport or culture , but travel . " lots of seniors collect a very generous pension , " he pointed out .
" they can take fantastic trips around the world , to south africa , america , new zealand .
when my generation is no longer around , billions of euro will be inherited . " many in germany complain that while the rest of the country is tightening its belt , old people have never had it so good .
but the older generation says it deserves a break . " my generation saved a lot of money for old age , " freimuth said .
" the majority of people between 60 and 80 have a lot of money at their disposal .
i see it in our closer circle of friends .
they buy new cars , and have more than one , own real estate , and take luxurious vacations . " future generations face uncertain old age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of retired people choose to move to a senior citizens ' home rather than live alone for seniors needing minimal assistance , the state can provide home-care workers who visit anywhere from once a week to a few times a day , to aid in medicine-taking , meals , grooming , shopping and cleaning . high unemployment has also prompted many families to care for their parents themselves , for which they are compensated with a few hundred euro per month by the state .
there are also special state-subsidized senior residences : apartments blocks or rooms exclusively for seniors with on-the-premises 24 hour emergency service , as well as a multitude of high quality old age homes for those needing constant care . but the real question is whether the high standard of care enjoyed by senior citizens today be available for the generations to come ? " it will be a financial problem , " espeter said .
" the high standard of care we have now will not be possible in the future , because more personnel will be needed .

now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .
but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .
the largely german crew would take their newly learned skills and apply them to their next project in germany , he pointed out . regardless of differences , both sides agree on one thing : european films - of ever-improving quality - are gaining a higher international profile .
on saturday , the european film academy based in barcelona will honor the cream of the crop at its annual european film prize awards .

what kind of quality of life , health , and care can the elderly expect in germany ? the number of senior citizens in germany is growing all the time - and germans are also living longer .
in less than 50 years ' time , 12 percent of the population will be over 80 , and scientists estimate that by the year 2050 , the life expectancy of the average german will have increased by a decade . so what is life like for germany 's ever-expanding ranks of senior citizens ? the threat of ageism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ageism is a common problem in the workplace for those still working , getting old is n't much fun .
otto wulff , chairman of germany 's senior citizens ' union , is currently planning to bring a constitutional case against the increasing discrimination against senior citizens in the workplace . only 35 percent of 55 to 65 year-olds in germany still work - half the number of working senior citizens in switzerland , scandinavia and the us . wulff argues it 's germany 's loss . " top class academics and scientists are relocating abroad .
germany ca n't afford to lose these people , " he said . pensions hardship ? meanwhile , franz ruland , ceo of the german association of pension insurers , said he is worried that the country might soon witness a rise in poverty among the elderly .
in an interview with german daily die welt , he said the long-term unemployed are paying too little into pension schemes , which will lead to later hardship . " particularly in the eastern states , widespread unemployment is going to lead to some serious problems , " he pointed out . moreover , berlin 's efforts to combat economic stagnation have included cutting pension payments .
amid expert predictions that the percentage of the nation 's working population aged 65 and over will reach more than 35 percent by 2030 , the level of retirement pensions was frozen in 2004 as a part of the government 's economic reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , pensioners took to the streets to protest welfare cuts the move was designed to help the government plug a shortfall of some € 10.3 million -lrb- $ 12 million -rrb- in state pension funds , caused by the ever-ageing population and fewer contributions to the fund due to high unemployment .
needless to say , the decision met with strong resistance from germany 's 20 million pensioners .
quality care but for the lucky ones , living to a ripe old age is rewarded with state-assured , quality of life care - unlike in days gone by .
ingrid espeter is director of the barbara von renthe fink old age home .
she can remember what life was like for the elderly members of her family , some 30 years back . " one aunt lived in a hall with 12 demented women , " she said .
" one of them always screamed and another just laid around like a zombie .
it was a horrible atmosphere . " much has changed since then . " older people are no longer neglected in old age homes , " espeter said .
" now they 're well taken care of , kept active and entertained .
there are many activities on offer ; music therapy , cooking groups , ferry trips , and many more things to keep seniors stimulated and happy .
these programs are obligatory if a home wants to receive state subsidies . " a life of leisure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pensioners discover the joys of travel late in life heinz freimuth retired from his job five years ago , and is more active than ever .
at 66 , he runs marathons , is an avid theater goer , offers counselling to other seniors at the local city hall , and makes time for his children and grandchildren . he claims the favorite pastime for older germans is not sport or culture , but travel . " lots of seniors collect a very generous pension , " he pointed out .
" they can take fantastic trips around the world , to south africa , america , new zealand .
when my generation is no longer around , billions of euro will be inherited . " many in germany complain that while the rest of the country is tightening its belt , old people have never had it so good .
but the older generation says it deserves a break . " my generation saved a lot of money for old age , " freimuth said .
" the majority of people between 60 and 80 have a lot of money at their disposal .
i see it in our closer circle of friends .
they buy new cars , and have more than one , own real estate , and take luxurious vacations . " future generations face uncertain old age bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of retired people choose to move to a senior citizens ' home rather than live alone for seniors needing minimal assistance , the state can provide home-care workers who visit anywhere from once a week to a few times a day , to aid in medicine-taking , meals , grooming , shopping and cleaning . high unemployment has also prompted many families to care for their parents themselves , for which they are compensated with a few hundred euro per month by the state .
there are also special state-subsidized senior residences : apartments blocks or rooms exclusively for seniors with on-the-premises 24 hour emergency service , as well as a multitude of high quality old age homes for those needing constant care . but the real question is whether the high standard of care enjoyed by senior citizens today be available for the generations to come ? " it will be a financial problem , " espeter said .
" the high standard of care we have now will not be possible in the future , because more personnel will be needed .

now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .

" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .

now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .

since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .

she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .

in an interview for the german sunday newspaper welt am sonntag mueller said : " if we merged with postbank we would become the biggest bank for retail customers in europe .
nevertheless for this to happen we need the go-ahead from the federal government . "
postbank , which had been sized up by germany 's biggest bank deutsche bank , has an 11 percent market share of the domestic retail banking sector .
the german postal authority deutsche post , of which postbank is the banking arm , floated 33 percent of postbank 's share capital on the stock market in june .
a further 16.9 percent is to be ceded to investors through convertible bonds , allowing deutsche post to keep 50.1 percent .
müller also did not rule out commerzbank being taken over by a foreign institution .
this would depend on it being an institution " which suits us well and which can provide a commitment not to destroy commerzbank , " he said . dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2005 berlin film festival set for scandal a bumper year for german film the best of germany 's silver screen berlinale joins european big three culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.12.2004 eu boosts home-grown filmmakers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french film " amelie " was a global hit in 2001 due to an eu initiative that promotes films abroad , european films are increasingly popular .
now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .
but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .
what 's more , its difficult for smaller european filmmakers to compete with hollywood filmmakers ' massive advertising budgets . " eighty percent of european films distributed outside of their country of origin receive funding from media plus , " cornelia hammelmann of the hamburg branch of the european film promotion initiative told deutsche welle . promoting individuality vs. fostering exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg motion pictures in potsdam , near berlin in hammelmann 's view , european films - compared to those made in the united states , have many unique and superior qualities .
she pointed to the scripts and stories , which she said are not as dependent on special effects to capture the viewer 's attention .
" the films are n't great films because of special effects alone - they are good scripts and excellently told stories , " she said . in contrast , henning molfenter , the director of the german film production company babelsberg motion pictures , based just outside berlin , said it was n't purely an issue of good scripts vs. special effects .
in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .
molfenter envisioned an exchange that would build a bridge between both cinematic traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european film awards will be announced saturday he pointed to the recent filming of a hollywood-produced movie starring charlize theron , which was filmed in babelsberg .
the largely german crew would take their newly learned skills and apply them to their next project in germany , he pointed out . regardless of differences , both sides agree on one thing : european films - of ever-improving quality - are gaining a higher international profile .
on saturday , the european film academy based in barcelona will honor the cream of the crop at its annual european film prize awards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2005 berlin film festival set for scandal a bumper year for german film the best of germany 's silver screen berlinale joins european big three culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.12.2004 eu boosts home-grown filmmakers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french film " amelie " was a global hit in 2001 due to an eu initiative that promotes films abroad , european films are increasingly popular .
now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .
with a war chest of € 400 million -lrb- $ 529 million -rrb- , its directors have ambitious plans to help european film contend with and challenge the dominance of hollywood movies .
but those within the industry differ over how to proceed . international promotion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european film festivals like in berlin draw international audiences .
since its inception , media plus has taken a leading role in several aspects of european film .
as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .

now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships . three years ago , " amelie , " the story of a young parsian girl who takes it upon herself to improve the lives of her fellow citizens , captured the attention of cinema-goers around the world .
though directed by the well-known french director jean-pierre jeunet , " amelie " would likely not have enjoyed such international success without the help of media plus , a little known eu initiative set-up to foster and promote european film abroad . the successor to the media program established by the eu in 1991 , media plus , an expanded version , was christened in 2001 and given an additional four-year mandate .

as part of its official mandate , the program trains up-and-coming filmmakers , develops projects and companies , and distributes and promotes films abroad . the latter efforts , however , have perhaps proven to be the most important , since european filmmakers have a long and respected tradition but suffer from relatively little name recognition overseas .

in his opinion , a hollywood film is not necessarily synonymous with action films and there is much european filmmakers can learn from hollywood 's high production value and topical themes .
" sometimes i think hollywood is just a bit faster in capturing the popular zeitgeist , " he said . instead of simply promoting the unique or superior aspects of european film , he would offer an alternative : bring hollywood producers to europe so both sides can profit .

serco and netherlands railways will operate 5,000 trains carrying more than 1m passengers a day .
delayed takeover the joint venture between the two firms should have started running the new franchise two months ago , but the contract for the deal with the strategic rail authority , now lasting slightly less than nine years , was not signed until the day after the scheduled takeover .
sero and netherlands railways have published a map of their northern routes northern managing director heidi mottram said the firm 's priorities were safety and providing better trains and services .
serco and netherlands railways took over the unique 25-year merseyrail franchise in 2003 .
serco also runs manchester 's trams and the london docklands railway .
sunday also sees the introduction of more regular and frequent transpennine services .
first keolis , which took over that franchise earlier this year , said the journeys between leeds and manchester would also be faster , affecting passengers travelling between sunderland , newcastle , county durham , yorkshire , north lincolnshire and manchester and liverpool .
transpennine express managing director vernon barker said : " the new timetable represents our first opportunity to make improvements to the speed , frequency and capacity of our services since we started the franchise in february .
" it represents a major step forward in revitalising the transpennine service for our customers . "
railway commuters more than 50,000 commuters a day use the company 's trains .
but not everyone is sure the weekend changeover will go smoothly .
the yorkshire coast community rail partnership has warned passengers that some making longer journeys will have to change trains at hull .

serco and netherlands railways will operate 5,000 trains carrying more than 1m passengers a day .
delayed takeover the joint venture between the two firms should have started running the new franchise two months ago , but the contract for the deal with the strategic rail authority , now lasting slightly less than nine years , was not signed until the day after the scheduled takeover .
sero and netherlands railways have published a map of their northern routes northern managing director heidi mottram said the firm 's priorities were safety and providing better trains and services .
serco and netherlands railways took over the unique 25-year merseyrail franchise in 2003 .
serco also runs manchester 's trams and the london docklands railway .

first keolis , which took over that franchise earlier this year , said the journeys between leeds and manchester would also be faster , affecting passengers travelling between sunderland , newcastle , county durham , yorkshire , north lincolnshire and manchester and liverpool .
transpennine express managing director vernon barker said : " the new timetable represents our first opportunity to make improvements to the speed , frequency and capacity of our services since we started the franchise in february .
" it represents a major step forward in revitalising the transpennine service for our customers . "
railway commuters more than 50,000 commuters a day use the company 's trains .
but not everyone is sure the weekend changeover will go smoothly .
the yorkshire coast community rail partnership has warned passengers that some making longer journeys will have to change trains at hull .
" with the massive investment in new tracks in our area and the orders for new rolling stock , we are looking forward to an improved service , " said development officer david walford .

independent travellers want greater flexibility figures released by the ski club of great britain show that independent skiers now make up almost 25 % of the market ; a rise of more than 300 % in the past five years .
" the growth of the independent skiers is one of the fundamental changes taking place in the industry , " says vanessa fisher from the ski club of great britain .
" they use budget airlines , book accommodation over the internet and save themselves a fortune . "
easyjet has seen the number of passengers flying to airports near the alps rise five-fold over the past four years .
around 1.2m british people head to the slopes each winter , and the growth in go-it-alone travellers could have severe financial consequences for the ski travel companies .
british tour operator bookings are already down for christmas with some holidays now being sold at half price as operators try to stop potential losses .
" in part this is due to christmas day and new year 's day falling on a saturday , the traditional change over day in ski resorts , " says peter hardy , co-editor of the good skiing and snowboarding guide .
" but it 's also due to the rise in people simply making their own arrangements and by-passing the tour operator . "
going diy last year i travelled independently to the swiss resort of zermatt .
it cost just over £ 500 for a week - with a tour operator it would have been around £ 800 .
surprisingly flight times are often more convenient and you retain more control over your holiday .
with its infrastructure and hotels switzerland is an ideal location the main difficulty is getting from the airport to the resort , but cheaper car hire and improved bus and rail links mean this is changing .
the swiss resorts of zermatt , davos and engleberg are particularly popular as they have a large number of hotels and direct rail connections .
swiss rail offers a return ticket from its airports to resort for £ 53 .
" we are targeting diy skiers as we feel switzerland with its good travel infrastructure and large number of hotels is an ideal destination " , says heidi reisz from switzerland tourism .
in france there are good bus connections to resorts and taxi firms have sprung up ferrying people to resorts such as chamonix , les gets and tignes .
while those in the know rent a car from the french side of geneva airport where prices can be up to 25 % cheaper than the swiss side .
independent effect the growth of the independent skier is already affecting the resorts as people choose hotels , with their greater flexibility , rather than the chalet .
over the past two years chalet accommodation has declined by 4 % .
resorts are also looking to offer more flexible accommodation than the traditional weekend-to-weekend package .
julian griffiths has seen an increase in number of self-arranged holidays the growth is also affecting other aspects of resorts .
" we used to get most of our business from the tour operators " , says julian griffiths from european snowsport , a british-run ski school based in verbier .
" however , we 're seeing an increasing number of people on self-arranged holidays so we must target them and offer them what they want , " he says .
last year 10 % of european snowsport 's bookings were made independently via the internet ; in the pre-season period this year it is already up to 20 % .
industry fights back the tour companies are now responding to the threat .
" for many it 's too much effort to co-ordinate the arrangements , their holiday is not bonded and they have no rep in the resort to help them out , " says stuart macleod , the managing director of the specialist holiday group that owns crystal , thompson and simply ski .
" we 'll respond to any changes in the travel market and we 're already doing this to meet the changing needs of skiers . "
with an eye to the future the tour operators are de-constructing the package holiday and offering tailor made packages with people selecting the parts they want .
