the neues deutschland from berlin said that the social democrats " feel like victims on behalf of their people and their fatherland , " for their unpopular reform agenda . but the " bigger victims " of the agenda are the people , the paper said , and it calls the green party " the only political power which can bring the social democrats to their senses and to self-preservation . "
the greens are the social democrats ' coalition partner .
thus , the paper suggested , the greens can " set new a new course " for the government .
but by refusing to do so , the greens seem also to be expecting " only to govern for two more years . "
so the neues deutschland concluded that the red-green coalition " must have a death wish . " die welt , also from berlin , pointed to the words of chancellor gerhard schröder after the election losses : " i can only go ahead with the current policies , and i only want to go ahead with the current policies . " the words remind the daily of martin luther , who insisted " here i stand ; i ca n't do otherwise . "
luther 's statement , the paper said , " led to the break-up " of the christian church ; schröder 's " just indicate a sullen resignation . " the handelsblatt from düsseldorf wrote schröder has gone from being a leader of his party to one of those being led .
" critics within the social democrats had forced schröder 's resignation as party head , " and " now they are calling for a cabinet reshuffle . " the freie presse from chemnitz in eastern germany also predicted schröder 's demise .
it compared him to former conservative chancellor helmut kohl . " during kohl 's sunset , he tried half-heartedly to reform the crusty old system , " the paper wrote .
" schröder himself came into power with populist promises to undo kohl 's mini-reforms . "
but now the conservatives " wo n't profit much from the loss of face of the social democrats " because " they are also responsible for " current policy .
the paper guessed that all in all the consequences will be that " great parties will shrink to relatively small parties . " the stuttgarter zeitung took the same line and imagined that " if the conservatives were in power , things would n't be different for them .
it 's easy to celebrate a victory , give big speeches and pitch yourself as an alternative , even if you 've also been partly responsible for the poor policy , " the daily commented .
" sometimes it 's fun to be in the opposition . " and the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle accused the social democrats of being " intellectually and emotionally unprepared " to implement reforms .
" with the change in government in 1998 , red-green hoped for economic growth and a healthy world economy to solve germany 's problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.06.2004 german press review : resigned to defeat ? tuesday 's german editorials again looked at the massive losses in support for germany 's ruling social democrats in the european parliamentary elections . german editorial writers seemed to be in full agreement that the social democratic party wo n't be ruling the country after the next elections - which at the latest will be in the year 2006 .
the neues deutschland from berlin said that the social democrats " feel like victims on behalf of their people and their fatherland , " for their unpopular reform agenda . but the " bigger victims " of the agenda are the people , the paper said , and it calls the green party " the only political power which can bring the social democrats to their senses and to self-preservation . "
the greens are the social democrats ' coalition partner .
thus , the paper suggested , the greens can " set new a new course " for the government .
but by refusing to do so , the greens seem also to be expecting " only to govern for two more years . "
so the neues deutschland concluded that the red-green coalition " must have a death wish . " die welt , also from berlin , pointed to the words of chancellor gerhard schröder after the election losses : " i can only go ahead with the current policies , and i only want to go ahead with the current policies . " the words remind the daily of martin luther , who insisted " here i stand ; i ca n't do otherwise . "
luther 's statement , the paper said , " led to the break-up " of the christian church ; schröder 's " just indicate a sullen resignation . " the handelsblatt from düsseldorf wrote schröder has gone from being a leader of his party to one of those being led .
" critics within the social democrats had forced schröder 's resignation as party head , " and " now they are calling for a cabinet reshuffle . " the freie presse from chemnitz in eastern germany also predicted schröder 's demise .
it compared him to former conservative chancellor helmut kohl . " during kohl 's sunset , he tried half-heartedly to reform the crusty old system , " the paper wrote .
" schröder himself came into power with populist promises to undo kohl 's mini-reforms . "
but now the conservatives " wo n't profit much from the loss of face of the social democrats " because " they are also responsible for " current policy .
the paper guessed that all in all the consequences will be that " great parties will shrink to relatively small parties . " the stuttgarter zeitung took the same line and imagined that " if the conservatives were in power , things would n't be different for them .
it 's easy to celebrate a victory , give big speeches and pitch yourself as an alternative , even if you 've also been partly responsible for the poor policy , " the daily commented .
" sometimes it 's fun to be in the opposition . " and the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle accused the social democrats of being " intellectually and emotionally unprepared " to implement reforms .
" with the change in government in 1998 , red-green hoped for economic growth and a healthy world economy to solve germany 's problems .
but these hopes are destroyed and the party lies helpless . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2004 germany gets back its appetite for mergers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank says it 's ready to go on a shopping spree after a lull period , new life is being breathed into the german market for mergers and acquisitions .
business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .
-lrb- april 26 , 2004 -rrb- air france-klm merger approved air france and royal dutch airlines -lrb- klm -rrb- will become the world 's largest airline in terms of revenue after european and u.s. authorities approved the deal .
the merger should be completed in the summer .

business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .
the fact that he is old , and in ill health is no reason to not have him in prison .

the neues deutschland from berlin said that the social democrats " feel like victims on behalf of their people and their fatherland , " for their unpopular reform agenda . but the " bigger victims " of the agenda are the people , the paper said , and it calls the green party " the only political power which can bring the social democrats to their senses and to self-preservation . "
the greens are the social democrats ' coalition partner .
thus , the paper suggested , the greens can " set new a new course " for the government .
but by refusing to do so , the greens seem also to be expecting " only to govern for two more years . "
so the neues deutschland concluded that the red-green coalition " must have a death wish . " die welt , also from berlin , pointed to the words of chancellor gerhard schröder after the election losses : " i can only go ahead with the current policies , and i only want to go ahead with the current policies . " the words remind the daily of martin luther , who insisted " here i stand ; i ca n't do otherwise . "
luther 's statement , the paper said , " led to the break-up " of the christian church ; schröder 's " just indicate a sullen resignation . " the handelsblatt from düsseldorf wrote schröder has gone from being a leader of his party to one of those being led .
" critics within the social democrats had forced schröder 's resignation as party head , " and " now they are calling for a cabinet reshuffle . " the freie presse from chemnitz in eastern germany also predicted schröder 's demise .
it compared him to former conservative chancellor helmut kohl . " during kohl 's sunset , he tried half-heartedly to reform the crusty old system , " the paper wrote .
" schröder himself came into power with populist promises to undo kohl 's mini-reforms . "
but now the conservatives " wo n't profit much from the loss of face of the social democrats " because " they are also responsible for " current policy .
the paper guessed that all in all the consequences will be that " great parties will shrink to relatively small parties . " the stuttgarter zeitung took the same line and imagined that " if the conservatives were in power , things would n't be different for them .
it 's easy to celebrate a victory , give big speeches and pitch yourself as an alternative , even if you 've also been partly responsible for the poor policy , " the daily commented .
" sometimes it 's fun to be in the opposition . " and the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle accused the social democrats of being " intellectually and emotionally unprepared " to implement reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.06.2004 schröder and chirac in sync ahead of eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac share a laugh at aachen 's cathedral the german and french leaders are going into a brussels eu summit this week with common positions on the nomination of the next commission president and reaching a deal for europe 's first constitution . meeting in the former seat of emperor charlemagne , a symbol of european unity , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on monday sought to tackle a smorgasbord of european political issues in aachen - from selecting a new european commission president to resolving conflicts over the draft constitution .
they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?
troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .

they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.06.2004 staying the course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussing defeat : schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and spd chairman müntefering despite crushing defeats for the social democratic party in sunday 's european and regional elections , chancellor gerhard schröder pledged to press ahead with his unpopular economic reform program . schröder stamped out speculations of a cabinet reshuffle or a reversal on his reform policies following his party 's poor showing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia . " there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .
" but we must pursue our policies because they are objectively necessary . " final results for the european parliament elections showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- with 21.5 percent of the vote , its worst postwar performance at a national poll .
the party fared little better in thuringia 's regional elections , taking just 14.5 percent of the vote , its third worst postwar result for a regional ballot . schröder acknowledged he has antagonized large numbers of voters with his unpopular package of welfare and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 . " of course it hurts when the support is n't there , " schröder said on monday before meeting with party leaders to discuss the electoral fiasco .
" but it is my firm conviction that this policy is necessary for our country . " party dissent but not all spd party leaders agree .
the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .
" when everywhere you look reforms are being pushed through without giving people any perspective on how they 're going to benefit , then they just become fearful , " harald schartau told the german business daily , handelsblatt .
" we ca n't just go on doling out the bitter medicine .
rather , we have to make sure that the remedies are effective . " schartau said it 's now up to the spd to win back its core supporters .
" spd voters are watching very keenly to see if their interests are being represented in the reforms , and if the resulting policies are socially balanced . " industry-heavy nrw has traditionally been a stronghold for the spd , and it 's also where the party is pinning its hopes for a significant turnaround to stop its run of defeats .
nrw will hold regional elections next may .
if the spd were to lose , the conservatives would then have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . analysts say such a scenario would usher in a period of political paralysis that would last until germany 's next parliamentary elections in 2006 . regaining trust many commentators in the german media doubt schröder 's ability to hold on to the spd 's voters .
for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .
but now the mortified frustration has been transformed into hopeful anticipation .
players and fans alike know they can do better , and have no intention of breaking their record of never losing a first round match in a european championship tournament . painting the town orange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch fans while the germans are marking the big showdown tonight with parties , celebrations and the erection of huge inner-city screens , the dutch are taking their momentary obsession one step further , swamping the little country in the national team 's color : orange .
entire city districts have been wrapped in orange , newspapers , which generally stick to the traditional black and white , have been injected with a dose of color and streets and even sidewalks have been painted over . besides the vibrant display of support for the boys who have traveled to portugal to defend the soccer honor of a nation , which in non-tournament times fails to generate much passion for the sport , there are gentle jokes aimed at their opponents .
it 's a side sport , a bi-product of the championships , and germany is at it too .
some berliners decided to cover up the name of their street , hollandstrasse , until after the match , and the boulevard press has become more pointed than usual . may the best team win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler germany coach rudi völler has already made it clear that the focus of the match will be on defense , and he is expected to opt for a formation with kevin kuranyi as the only striker .
but even a strong line of defense might not be enough to stave of the determination of the dutch side , which has the greater talent of the two teams .
that said , just as dutch coach dick advocaat 's men have a bit of a reputation for under-achieving at major events , the german team have a miraculous ability to pull it off at the last minute . it 's a well-known fact and a source of contempt for some in the netherlands , who claim the fear they used to feel when their squad was pitched against germany has long since turned into pity .
they pity the lot of a team comprised of anti-soccer artists , players who defend their way to last-minute victory , who have no style on the pitch , and who often just do n't deserve the victories they eek out of their matches . whatever the outcome of this tournament highlight - for 90 minutes tonight tens of millions of feverish fans will shout and cry , hope and pray and watch as the better team plays its way to victory . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thirsty fans drink portugal dry sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . -lrb- 14 june 2004 -rrb- sweden crushes bulgaria lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2004 germany gets back its appetite for mergers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank says it 's ready to go on a shopping spree after a lull period , new life is being breathed into the german market for mergers and acquisitions .
business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .
-lrb- april 26 , 2004 -rrb- air france-klm merger approved air france and royal dutch airlines -lrb- klm -rrb- will become the world 's largest airline in terms of revenue after european and u.s. authorities approved the deal .
the merger should be completed in the summer .

business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .

" the portugal result is a lesson on how the little teams can beat the favorites , " starkovs said . that attitude was clearly spread to the entire squad , because the latvians were n't afraid to take their chances when they presented themselves .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .
the fact that he is old , and in ill health is no reason to not have him in prison .
he should be held responsible for his crimes . - kristine stuef , canada papon belongs in prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.06.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc german court reexamines berlin bombing case a federal appeals court in leipzig is reviewing the sentences handed down in the case of the 1986 bomb attack on a disco in berlin that killed three people and injured more than 200 .
a court in berlin ruled in 2001 that the attack on la belle disco , which was frequented by u.s. soldiers , was planned by libya 's secret service .
the court then convicted verena chanaa , a german who planted the bomb , to 14 years in prison .
yassir chraidi , a palestinian , was also found guilty and sentenced to 13 years .
two other , musbah abdulghasem eter and ali chanaa , a libyan and lebanese-born german respectively , received 12-year sentences each .
prosecutors are now arguing that the sentences were too lenient although they have not specified how much they want the punishments raised .
in the case of the three men , the prosecution is arguing that while they were convicted as accessories , they should have been sentenced as accomplices .
defense lawyers are also appealing , but want the sentences of the four reduced . dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .
the talks will continue in june .

they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?
troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.06.2004 staying the course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussing defeat : schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and spd chairman müntefering despite crushing defeats for the social democratic party in sunday 's european and regional elections , chancellor gerhard schröder pledged to press ahead with his unpopular economic reform program . schröder stamped out speculations of a cabinet reshuffle or a reversal on his reform policies following his party 's poor showing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia . " there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .
" but we must pursue our policies because they are objectively necessary . " final results for the european parliament elections showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- with 21.5 percent of the vote , its worst postwar performance at a national poll .
the party fared little better in thuringia 's regional elections , taking just 14.5 percent of the vote , its third worst postwar result for a regional ballot . schröder acknowledged he has antagonized large numbers of voters with his unpopular package of welfare and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 . " of course it hurts when the support is n't there , " schröder said on monday before meeting with party leaders to discuss the electoral fiasco .
" but it is my firm conviction that this policy is necessary for our country . " party dissent but not all spd party leaders agree .
the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .
" when everywhere you look reforms are being pushed through without giving people any perspective on how they 're going to benefit , then they just become fearful , " harald schartau told the german business daily , handelsblatt .
" we ca n't just go on doling out the bitter medicine .
rather , we have to make sure that the remedies are effective . " schartau said it 's now up to the spd to win back its core supporters .
" spd voters are watching very keenly to see if their interests are being represented in the reforms , and if the resulting policies are socially balanced . " industry-heavy nrw has traditionally been a stronghold for the spd , and it 's also where the party is pinning its hopes for a significant turnaround to stop its run of defeats .
nrw will hold regional elections next may .
if the spd were to lose , the conservatives would then have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . analysts say such a scenario would usher in a period of political paralysis that would last until germany 's next parliamentary elections in 2006 . regaining trust many commentators in the german media doubt schröder 's ability to hold on to the spd 's voters .
for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .
" it needs to become clear to people that agenda 2010 will eventually benefit everyone , not just a few , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : resigned to defeat ?

business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .

gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .

group d favorite the czech republic barely managed to avoid a humiliating defeat on tuesday , coming from behind to thwart an early latvian lead to win 2-1 . it would have been the biggest upset yet at euro 2004 , but unfortunately for tiny latvia it was not meant to be .
despite the clear dominance of the czechs , the latvians were able to score first and stay ahead for most of the match . aware of their underdog status , latvia still came to the pitch confident of being able to win or very least hold the czechs to a draw .
latvian coach aleksandrs starkovs said before the game that greece 's opening day shock win over hosts portugal proved anything was possible .
" the portugal result is a lesson on how the little teams can beat the favorites , " starkovs said . that attitude was clearly spread to the entire squad , because the latvians were n't afraid to take their chances when they presented themselves .
the surprise lead came right before halftime when maris verpakovskis sunk a pointblank shot that stunned the czechs . bildunterschrift : the czechs answered by peppering the latvian goal with shots , however , keeper aleksandrs kolinko was able to handle everything that came his way . the favorites came back from the break hoping to quickly equalize , but czech captain and juventus star pavel nedved and his teammates were unable to put anything past kolinko .
only in the 73rd minute was milan baros able to bring the czechs level after the lativan keeper deflected a corner . after that shook up the latvians , the czechs kept the pressure on and marek heinz put the czechs ahead in the 85th minute . after the tough win czech midfielder tomas rosicky conceeded the lativans were n't as easy as had been hoped .
" that was certainly the hardest match of the group .
against holland and germany it will definitely be easier , " rosicky said . lineups : czech republic : petr cech ; zdenek grygera , tomas galasek , rene bolf , marek jankulovski , karel poborsky , jan koller , tomas rosicky , pavel nedved , milan baros , tomas ujfalusi . latvia : aleksandrs kolinko , igors stepanovs , vitalijs astafjevs , mihails zemlinskis , olegs blagonadezdins , aleksandrs isakofvs , imants bleidelis , maris verpakovskis , andrejs rubins , andrejs prohorenkovs , valentis lobanovs . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group d : germany , holland , latvia , czech republic the so-called " group of death " puts three top teams up against each other in a fight to avoid the second elimination spot as it looks inevitable that latvia will claim the first at the end of the group stage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.06.2004 staying the course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussing defeat : schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and spd chairman müntefering despite crushing defeats for the social democratic party in sunday 's european and regional elections , chancellor gerhard schröder pledged to press ahead with his unpopular economic reform program . schröder stamped out speculations of a cabinet reshuffle or a reversal on his reform policies following his party 's poor showing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia . " there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .
" but we must pursue our policies because they are objectively necessary . " final results for the european parliament elections showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- with 21.5 percent of the vote , its worst postwar performance at a national poll .
the party fared little better in thuringia 's regional elections , taking just 14.5 percent of the vote , its third worst postwar result for a regional ballot . schröder acknowledged he has antagonized large numbers of voters with his unpopular package of welfare and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 . " of course it hurts when the support is n't there , " schröder said on monday before meeting with party leaders to discuss the electoral fiasco .
" but it is my firm conviction that this policy is necessary for our country . " party dissent but not all spd party leaders agree .
the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .
" when everywhere you look reforms are being pushed through without giving people any perspective on how they 're going to benefit , then they just become fearful , " harald schartau told the german business daily , handelsblatt .
" we ca n't just go on doling out the bitter medicine .
rather , we have to make sure that the remedies are effective . " schartau said it 's now up to the spd to win back its core supporters .
" spd voters are watching very keenly to see if their interests are being represented in the reforms , and if the resulting policies are socially balanced . " industry-heavy nrw has traditionally been a stronghold for the spd , and it 's also where the party is pinning its hopes for a significant turnaround to stop its run of defeats .
nrw will hold regional elections next may .
if the spd were to lose , the conservatives would then have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . analysts say such a scenario would usher in a period of political paralysis that would last until germany 's next parliamentary elections in 2006 . regaining trust many commentators in the german media doubt schröder 's ability to hold on to the spd 's voters .
for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .
" it needs to become clear to people that agenda 2010 will eventually benefit everyone , not just a few , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : resigned to defeat ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.06.2004 schröder and chirac in sync ahead of eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac share a laugh at aachen 's cathedral the german and french leaders are going into a brussels eu summit this week with common positions on the nomination of the next commission president and reaching a deal for europe 's first constitution . meeting in the former seat of emperor charlemagne , a symbol of european unity , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on monday sought to tackle a smorgasbord of european political issues in aachen - from selecting a new european commission president to resolving conflicts over the draft constitution .
they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2004 germany gets back its appetite for mergers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank says it 's ready to go on a shopping spree after a lull period , new life is being breathed into the german market for mergers and acquisitions .
business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .
but now the mortified frustration has been transformed into hopeful anticipation .
players and fans alike know they can do better , and have no intention of breaking their record of never losing a first round match in a european championship tournament . painting the town orange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch fans while the germans are marking the big showdown tonight with parties , celebrations and the erection of huge inner-city screens , the dutch are taking their momentary obsession one step further , swamping the little country in the national team 's color : orange .
entire city districts have been wrapped in orange , newspapers , which generally stick to the traditional black and white , have been injected with a dose of color and streets and even sidewalks have been painted over . besides the vibrant display of support for the boys who have traveled to portugal to defend the soccer honor of a nation , which in non-tournament times fails to generate much passion for the sport , there are gentle jokes aimed at their opponents .
it 's a side sport , a bi-product of the championships , and germany is at it too .
some berliners decided to cover up the name of their street , hollandstrasse , until after the match , and the boulevard press has become more pointed than usual . may the best team win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler germany coach rudi völler has already made it clear that the focus of the match will be on defense , and he is expected to opt for a formation with kevin kuranyi as the only striker .
but even a strong line of defense might not be enough to stave of the determination of the dutch side , which has the greater talent of the two teams .
that said , just as dutch coach dick advocaat 's men have a bit of a reputation for under-achieving at major events , the german team have a miraculous ability to pull it off at the last minute . it 's a well-known fact and a source of contempt for some in the netherlands , who claim the fear they used to feel when their squad was pitched against germany has long since turned into pity .
they pity the lot of a team comprised of anti-soccer artists , players who defend their way to last-minute victory , who have no style on the pitch , and who often just do n't deserve the victories they eek out of their matches . whatever the outcome of this tournament highlight - for 90 minutes tonight tens of millions of feverish fans will shout and cry , hope and pray and watch as the better team plays its way to victory . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thirsty fans drink portugal dry sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . -lrb- 14 june 2004 -rrb- sweden crushes bulgaria lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .
the fact that he is old , and in ill health is no reason to not have him in prison .
he should be held responsible for his crimes . - kristine stuef , canada papon belongs in prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 15.06.2004 germany meets holland for soccer showdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can germany ward off the orange hordes ?
when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .
but now the mortified frustration has been transformed into hopeful anticipation .
players and fans alike know they can do better , and have no intention of breaking their record of never losing a first round match in a european championship tournament . painting the town orange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch fans while the germans are marking the big showdown tonight with parties , celebrations and the erection of huge inner-city screens , the dutch are taking their momentary obsession one step further , swamping the little country in the national team 's color : orange .
entire city districts have been wrapped in orange , newspapers , which generally stick to the traditional black and white , have been injected with a dose of color and streets and even sidewalks have been painted over . besides the vibrant display of support for the boys who have traveled to portugal to defend the soccer honor of a nation , which in non-tournament times fails to generate much passion for the sport , there are gentle jokes aimed at their opponents .
it 's a side sport , a bi-product of the championships , and germany is at it too .
some berliners decided to cover up the name of their street , hollandstrasse , until after the match , and the boulevard press has become more pointed than usual . may the best team win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler germany coach rudi völler has already made it clear that the focus of the match will be on defense , and he is expected to opt for a formation with kevin kuranyi as the only striker .
but even a strong line of defense might not be enough to stave of the determination of the dutch side , which has the greater talent of the two teams .
that said , just as dutch coach dick advocaat 's men have a bit of a reputation for under-achieving at major events , the german team have a miraculous ability to pull it off at the last minute . it 's a well-known fact and a source of contempt for some in the netherlands , who claim the fear they used to feel when their squad was pitched against germany has long since turned into pity .
they pity the lot of a team comprised of anti-soccer artists , players who defend their way to last-minute victory , who have no style on the pitch , and who often just do n't deserve the victories they eek out of their matches . whatever the outcome of this tournament highlight - for 90 minutes tonight tens of millions of feverish fans will shout and cry , hope and pray and watch as the better team plays its way to victory . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thirsty fans drink portugal dry sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . -lrb- 14 june 2004 -rrb- sweden crushes bulgaria lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.06.2004 german press review : resigned to defeat ? tuesday 's german editorials again looked at the massive losses in support for germany 's ruling social democrats in the european parliamentary elections . german editorial writers seemed to be in full agreement that the social democratic party wo n't be ruling the country after the next elections - which at the latest will be in the year 2006 .
the neues deutschland from berlin said that the social democrats " feel like victims on behalf of their people and their fatherland , " for their unpopular reform agenda . but the " bigger victims " of the agenda are the people , the paper said , and it calls the green party " the only political power which can bring the social democrats to their senses and to self-preservation . "
the greens are the social democrats ' coalition partner .
thus , the paper suggested , the greens can " set new a new course " for the government .
but by refusing to do so , the greens seem also to be expecting " only to govern for two more years . "
so the neues deutschland concluded that the red-green coalition " must have a death wish . " die welt , also from berlin , pointed to the words of chancellor gerhard schröder after the election losses : " i can only go ahead with the current policies , and i only want to go ahead with the current policies . " the words remind the daily of martin luther , who insisted " here i stand ; i ca n't do otherwise . "
luther 's statement , the paper said , " led to the break-up " of the christian church ; schröder 's " just indicate a sullen resignation . " the handelsblatt from düsseldorf wrote schröder has gone from being a leader of his party to one of those being led .
" critics within the social democrats had forced schröder 's resignation as party head , " and " now they are calling for a cabinet reshuffle . " the freie presse from chemnitz in eastern germany also predicted schröder 's demise .
it compared him to former conservative chancellor helmut kohl . " during kohl 's sunset , he tried half-heartedly to reform the crusty old system , " the paper wrote .
" schröder himself came into power with populist promises to undo kohl 's mini-reforms . "
but now the conservatives " wo n't profit much from the loss of face of the social democrats " because " they are also responsible for " current policy .
the paper guessed that all in all the consequences will be that " great parties will shrink to relatively small parties . " the stuttgarter zeitung took the same line and imagined that " if the conservatives were in power , things would n't be different for them .
it 's easy to celebrate a victory , give big speeches and pitch yourself as an alternative , even if you 've also been partly responsible for the poor policy , " the daily commented .
" sometimes it 's fun to be in the opposition . " and the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle accused the social democrats of being " intellectually and emotionally unprepared " to implement reforms .
" with the change in government in 1998 , red-green hoped for economic growth and a healthy world economy to solve germany 's problems .
but these hopes are destroyed and the party lies helpless . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2004 germany gets back its appetite for mergers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank says it 's ready to go on a shopping spree after a lull period , new life is being breathed into the german market for mergers and acquisitions .
business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.06.2004 german press review : resigned to defeat ? tuesday 's german editorials again looked at the massive losses in support for germany 's ruling social democrats in the european parliamentary elections . german editorial writers seemed to be in full agreement that the social democratic party wo n't be ruling the country after the next elections - which at the latest will be in the year 2006 .
the neues deutschland from berlin said that the social democrats " feel like victims on behalf of their people and their fatherland , " for their unpopular reform agenda . but the " bigger victims " of the agenda are the people , the paper said , and it calls the green party " the only political power which can bring the social democrats to their senses and to self-preservation . "
the greens are the social democrats ' coalition partner .
thus , the paper suggested , the greens can " set new a new course " for the government .
but by refusing to do so , the greens seem also to be expecting " only to govern for two more years . "
so the neues deutschland concluded that the red-green coalition " must have a death wish . " die welt , also from berlin , pointed to the words of chancellor gerhard schröder after the election losses : " i can only go ahead with the current policies , and i only want to go ahead with the current policies . " the words remind the daily of martin luther , who insisted " here i stand ; i ca n't do otherwise . "
luther 's statement , the paper said , " led to the break-up " of the christian church ; schröder 's " just indicate a sullen resignation . " the handelsblatt from düsseldorf wrote schröder has gone from being a leader of his party to one of those being led .
" critics within the social democrats had forced schröder 's resignation as party head , " and " now they are calling for a cabinet reshuffle . " the freie presse from chemnitz in eastern germany also predicted schröder 's demise .
it compared him to former conservative chancellor helmut kohl . " during kohl 's sunset , he tried half-heartedly to reform the crusty old system , " the paper wrote .
" schröder himself came into power with populist promises to undo kohl 's mini-reforms . "
but now the conservatives " wo n't profit much from the loss of face of the social democrats " because " they are also responsible for " current policy .
the paper guessed that all in all the consequences will be that " great parties will shrink to relatively small parties . " the stuttgarter zeitung took the same line and imagined that " if the conservatives were in power , things would n't be different for them .
it 's easy to celebrate a victory , give big speeches and pitch yourself as an alternative , even if you 've also been partly responsible for the poor policy , " the daily commented .
" sometimes it 's fun to be in the opposition . " and the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle accused the social democrats of being " intellectually and emotionally unprepared " to implement reforms .
" with the change in government in 1998 , red-green hoped for economic growth and a healthy world economy to solve germany 's problems .
but these hopes are destroyed and the party lies helpless . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .
the fact that he is old , and in ill health is no reason to not have him in prison .
he should be held responsible for his crimes . - kristine stuef , canada papon belongs in prison .
i subscribe to the feelings of the wiesenthal center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.06.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc german court reexamines berlin bombing case a federal appeals court in leipzig is reviewing the sentences handed down in the case of the 1986 bomb attack on a disco in berlin that killed three people and injured more than 200 .
a court in berlin ruled in 2001 that the attack on la belle disco , which was frequented by u.s. soldiers , was planned by libya 's secret service .
the court then convicted verena chanaa , a german who planted the bomb , to 14 years in prison .
yassir chraidi , a palestinian , was also found guilty and sentenced to 13 years .
two other , musbah abdulghasem eter and ali chanaa , a libyan and lebanese-born german respectively , received 12-year sentences each .
prosecutors are now arguing that the sentences were too lenient although they have not specified how much they want the punishments raised .
in the case of the three men , the prosecution is arguing that while they were convicted as accessories , they should have been sentenced as accomplices .
defense lawyers are also appealing , but want the sentences of the four reduced . dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .
the talks will continue in june .

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .
but now the mortified frustration has been transformed into hopeful anticipation .
players and fans alike know they can do better , and have no intention of breaking their record of never losing a first round match in a european championship tournament . painting the town orange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch fans while the germans are marking the big showdown tonight with parties , celebrations and the erection of huge inner-city screens , the dutch are taking their momentary obsession one step further , swamping the little country in the national team 's color : orange .
entire city districts have been wrapped in orange , newspapers , which generally stick to the traditional black and white , have been injected with a dose of color and streets and even sidewalks have been painted over . besides the vibrant display of support for the boys who have traveled to portugal to defend the soccer honor of a nation , which in non-tournament times fails to generate much passion for the sport , there are gentle jokes aimed at their opponents .
it 's a side sport , a bi-product of the championships , and germany is at it too .
some berliners decided to cover up the name of their street , hollandstrasse , until after the match , and the boulevard press has become more pointed than usual . may the best team win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler germany coach rudi völler has already made it clear that the focus of the match will be on defense , and he is expected to opt for a formation with kevin kuranyi as the only striker .
but even a strong line of defense might not be enough to stave of the determination of the dutch side , which has the greater talent of the two teams .
that said , just as dutch coach dick advocaat 's men have a bit of a reputation for under-achieving at major events , the german team have a miraculous ability to pull it off at the last minute . it 's a well-known fact and a source of contempt for some in the netherlands , who claim the fear they used to feel when their squad was pitched against germany has long since turned into pity .
they pity the lot of a team comprised of anti-soccer artists , players who defend their way to last-minute victory , who have no style on the pitch , and who often just do n't deserve the victories they eek out of their matches . whatever the outcome of this tournament highlight - for 90 minutes tonight tens of millions of feverish fans will shout and cry , hope and pray and watch as the better team plays its way to victory . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thirsty fans drink portugal dry sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . -lrb- 14 june 2004 -rrb- sweden crushes bulgaria lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .
the fact that he is old , and in ill health is no reason to not have him in prison .
he should be held responsible for his crimes . - kristine stuef , canada papon belongs in prison .
i subscribe to the feelings of the wiesenthal center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.06.2004 german press review : resigned to defeat ? tuesday 's german editorials again looked at the massive losses in support for germany 's ruling social democrats in the european parliamentary elections . german editorial writers seemed to be in full agreement that the social democratic party wo n't be ruling the country after the next elections - which at the latest will be in the year 2006 .
the neues deutschland from berlin said that the social democrats " feel like victims on behalf of their people and their fatherland , " for their unpopular reform agenda . but the " bigger victims " of the agenda are the people , the paper said , and it calls the green party " the only political power which can bring the social democrats to their senses and to self-preservation . "
the greens are the social democrats ' coalition partner .
thus , the paper suggested , the greens can " set new a new course " for the government .
but by refusing to do so , the greens seem also to be expecting " only to govern for two more years . "
so the neues deutschland concluded that the red-green coalition " must have a death wish . " die welt , also from berlin , pointed to the words of chancellor gerhard schröder after the election losses : " i can only go ahead with the current policies , and i only want to go ahead with the current policies . " the words remind the daily of martin luther , who insisted " here i stand ; i ca n't do otherwise . "
luther 's statement , the paper said , " led to the break-up " of the christian church ; schröder 's " just indicate a sullen resignation . " the handelsblatt from düsseldorf wrote schröder has gone from being a leader of his party to one of those being led .
" critics within the social democrats had forced schröder 's resignation as party head , " and " now they are calling for a cabinet reshuffle . " the freie presse from chemnitz in eastern germany also predicted schröder 's demise .
it compared him to former conservative chancellor helmut kohl . " during kohl 's sunset , he tried half-heartedly to reform the crusty old system , " the paper wrote .
" schröder himself came into power with populist promises to undo kohl 's mini-reforms . "
but now the conservatives " wo n't profit much from the loss of face of the social democrats " because " they are also responsible for " current policy .
the paper guessed that all in all the consequences will be that " great parties will shrink to relatively small parties . " the stuttgarter zeitung took the same line and imagined that " if the conservatives were in power , things would n't be different for them .
it 's easy to celebrate a victory , give big speeches and pitch yourself as an alternative , even if you 've also been partly responsible for the poor policy , " the daily commented .
" sometimes it 's fun to be in the opposition . " and the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle accused the social democrats of being " intellectually and emotionally unprepared " to implement reforms .
" with the change in government in 1998 , red-green hoped for economic growth and a healthy world economy to solve germany 's problems .

the neues deutschland from berlin said that the social democrats " feel like victims on behalf of their people and their fatherland , " for their unpopular reform agenda . but the " bigger victims " of the agenda are the people , the paper said , and it calls the green party " the only political power which can bring the social democrats to their senses and to self-preservation . "
the greens are the social democrats ' coalition partner .
thus , the paper suggested , the greens can " set new a new course " for the government .
but by refusing to do so , the greens seem also to be expecting " only to govern for two more years . "
so the neues deutschland concluded that the red-green coalition " must have a death wish . " die welt , also from berlin , pointed to the words of chancellor gerhard schröder after the election losses : " i can only go ahead with the current policies , and i only want to go ahead with the current policies . " the words remind the daily of martin luther , who insisted " here i stand ; i ca n't do otherwise . "
luther 's statement , the paper said , " led to the break-up " of the christian church ; schröder 's " just indicate a sullen resignation . " the handelsblatt from düsseldorf wrote schröder has gone from being a leader of his party to one of those being led .
" critics within the social democrats had forced schröder 's resignation as party head , " and " now they are calling for a cabinet reshuffle . " the freie presse from chemnitz in eastern germany also predicted schröder 's demise .
it compared him to former conservative chancellor helmut kohl . " during kohl 's sunset , he tried half-heartedly to reform the crusty old system , " the paper wrote .
" schröder himself came into power with populist promises to undo kohl 's mini-reforms . "
but now the conservatives " wo n't profit much from the loss of face of the social democrats " because " they are also responsible for " current policy .
the paper guessed that all in all the consequences will be that " great parties will shrink to relatively small parties . " the stuttgarter zeitung took the same line and imagined that " if the conservatives were in power , things would n't be different for them .
it 's easy to celebrate a victory , give big speeches and pitch yourself as an alternative , even if you 've also been partly responsible for the poor policy , " the daily commented .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .

" there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2004 germany gets back its appetite for mergers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank says it 's ready to go on a shopping spree after a lull period , new life is being breathed into the german market for mergers and acquisitions .
business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .
-lrb- april 26 , 2004 -rrb- air france-klm merger approved air france and royal dutch airlines -lrb- klm -rrb- will become the world 's largest airline in terms of revenue after european and u.s. authorities approved the deal .

" there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .
" but we must pursue our policies because they are objectively necessary . " final results for the european parliament elections showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- with 21.5 percent of the vote , its worst postwar performance at a national poll .
the party fared little better in thuringia 's regional elections , taking just 14.5 percent of the vote , its third worst postwar result for a regional ballot . schröder acknowledged he has antagonized large numbers of voters with his unpopular package of welfare and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 . " of course it hurts when the support is n't there , " schröder said on monday before meeting with party leaders to discuss the electoral fiasco .
" but it is my firm conviction that this policy is necessary for our country . " party dissent but not all spd party leaders agree .
the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .
" when everywhere you look reforms are being pushed through without giving people any perspective on how they 're going to benefit , then they just become fearful , " harald schartau told the german business daily , handelsblatt .
" we ca n't just go on doling out the bitter medicine .
rather , we have to make sure that the remedies are effective . " schartau said it 's now up to the spd to win back its core supporters .
" spd voters are watching very keenly to see if their interests are being represented in the reforms , and if the resulting policies are socially balanced . " industry-heavy nrw has traditionally been a stronghold for the spd , and it 's also where the party is pinning its hopes for a significant turnaround to stop its run of defeats .
nrw will hold regional elections next may .
if the spd were to lose , the conservatives would then have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . analysts say such a scenario would usher in a period of political paralysis that would last until germany 's next parliamentary elections in 2006 . regaining trust many commentators in the german media doubt schröder 's ability to hold on to the spd 's voters .
for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .
but now the mortified frustration has been transformed into hopeful anticipation .
players and fans alike know they can do better , and have no intention of breaking their record of never losing a first round match in a european championship tournament . painting the town orange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch fans while the germans are marking the big showdown tonight with parties , celebrations and the erection of huge inner-city screens , the dutch are taking their momentary obsession one step further , swamping the little country in the national team 's color : orange .
entire city districts have been wrapped in orange , newspapers , which generally stick to the traditional black and white , have been injected with a dose of color and streets and even sidewalks have been painted over . besides the vibrant display of support for the boys who have traveled to portugal to defend the soccer honor of a nation , which in non-tournament times fails to generate much passion for the sport , there are gentle jokes aimed at their opponents .
it 's a side sport , a bi-product of the championships , and germany is at it too .
some berliners decided to cover up the name of their street , hollandstrasse , until after the match , and the boulevard press has become more pointed than usual . may the best team win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler germany coach rudi völler has already made it clear that the focus of the match will be on defense , and he is expected to opt for a formation with kevin kuranyi as the only striker .
but even a strong line of defense might not be enough to stave of the determination of the dutch side , which has the greater talent of the two teams .
that said , just as dutch coach dick advocaat 's men have a bit of a reputation for under-achieving at major events , the german team have a miraculous ability to pull it off at the last minute . it 's a well-known fact and a source of contempt for some in the netherlands , who claim the fear they used to feel when their squad was pitched against germany has long since turned into pity .
they pity the lot of a team comprised of anti-soccer artists , players who defend their way to last-minute victory , who have no style on the pitch , and who often just do n't deserve the victories they eek out of their matches . whatever the outcome of this tournament highlight - for 90 minutes tonight tens of millions of feverish fans will shout and cry , hope and pray and watch as the better team plays its way to victory . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thirsty fans drink portugal dry sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . -lrb- 14 june 2004 -rrb- sweden crushes bulgaria lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .
but now the mortified frustration has been transformed into hopeful anticipation .
players and fans alike know they can do better , and have no intention of breaking their record of never losing a first round match in a european championship tournament . painting the town orange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch fans while the germans are marking the big showdown tonight with parties , celebrations and the erection of huge inner-city screens , the dutch are taking their momentary obsession one step further , swamping the little country in the national team 's color : orange .
entire city districts have been wrapped in orange , newspapers , which generally stick to the traditional black and white , have been injected with a dose of color and streets and even sidewalks have been painted over . besides the vibrant display of support for the boys who have traveled to portugal to defend the soccer honor of a nation , which in non-tournament times fails to generate much passion for the sport , there are gentle jokes aimed at their opponents .
it 's a side sport , a bi-product of the championships , and germany is at it too .
some berliners decided to cover up the name of their street , hollandstrasse , until after the match , and the boulevard press has become more pointed than usual . may the best team win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler germany coach rudi völler has already made it clear that the focus of the match will be on defense , and he is expected to opt for a formation with kevin kuranyi as the only striker .
but even a strong line of defense might not be enough to stave of the determination of the dutch side , which has the greater talent of the two teams .
that said , just as dutch coach dick advocaat 's men have a bit of a reputation for under-achieving at major events , the german team have a miraculous ability to pull it off at the last minute . it 's a well-known fact and a source of contempt for some in the netherlands , who claim the fear they used to feel when their squad was pitched against germany has long since turned into pity .
they pity the lot of a team comprised of anti-soccer artists , players who defend their way to last-minute victory , who have no style on the pitch , and who often just do n't deserve the victories they eek out of their matches . whatever the outcome of this tournament highlight - for 90 minutes tonight tens of millions of feverish fans will shout and cry , hope and pray and watch as the better team plays its way to victory . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thirsty fans drink portugal dry sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . -lrb- 14 june 2004 -rrb- sweden crushes bulgaria lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?

they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2004 germany gets back its appetite for mergers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank says it 's ready to go on a shopping spree after a lull period , new life is being breathed into the german market for mergers and acquisitions .
business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .

group d favorite the czech republic barely managed to avoid a humiliating defeat on tuesday , coming from behind to thwart an early latvian lead to win 2-1 . it would have been the biggest upset yet at euro 2004 , but unfortunately for tiny latvia it was not meant to be .
despite the clear dominance of the czechs , the latvians were able to score first and stay ahead for most of the match . aware of their underdog status , latvia still came to the pitch confident of being able to win or very least hold the czechs to a draw .
latvian coach aleksandrs starkovs said before the game that greece 's opening day shock win over hosts portugal proved anything was possible .
" the portugal result is a lesson on how the little teams can beat the favorites , " starkovs said . that attitude was clearly spread to the entire squad , because the latvians were n't afraid to take their chances when they presented themselves .
the surprise lead came right before halftime when maris verpakovskis sunk a pointblank shot that stunned the czechs . bildunterschrift : the czechs answered by peppering the latvian goal with shots , however , keeper aleksandrs kolinko was able to handle everything that came his way . the favorites came back from the break hoping to quickly equalize , but czech captain and juventus star pavel nedved and his teammates were unable to put anything past kolinko .
only in the 73rd minute was milan baros able to bring the czechs level after the lativan keeper deflected a corner . after that shook up the latvians , the czechs kept the pressure on and marek heinz put the czechs ahead in the 85th minute . after the tough win czech midfielder tomas rosicky conceeded the lativans were n't as easy as had been hoped .

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .
but now the mortified frustration has been transformed into hopeful anticipation .
players and fans alike know they can do better , and have no intention of breaking their record of never losing a first round match in a european championship tournament . painting the town orange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch fans while the germans are marking the big showdown tonight with parties , celebrations and the erection of huge inner-city screens , the dutch are taking their momentary obsession one step further , swamping the little country in the national team 's color : orange .
entire city districts have been wrapped in orange , newspapers , which generally stick to the traditional black and white , have been injected with a dose of color and streets and even sidewalks have been painted over . besides the vibrant display of support for the boys who have traveled to portugal to defend the soccer honor of a nation , which in non-tournament times fails to generate much passion for the sport , there are gentle jokes aimed at their opponents .
it 's a side sport , a bi-product of the championships , and germany is at it too .
some berliners decided to cover up the name of their street , hollandstrasse , until after the match , and the boulevard press has become more pointed than usual . may the best team win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler germany coach rudi völler has already made it clear that the focus of the match will be on defense , and he is expected to opt for a formation with kevin kuranyi as the only striker .
but even a strong line of defense might not be enough to stave of the determination of the dutch side , which has the greater talent of the two teams .
that said , just as dutch coach dick advocaat 's men have a bit of a reputation for under-achieving at major events , the german team have a miraculous ability to pull it off at the last minute . it 's a well-known fact and a source of contempt for some in the netherlands , who claim the fear they used to feel when their squad was pitched against germany has long since turned into pity .
they pity the lot of a team comprised of anti-soccer artists , players who defend their way to last-minute victory , who have no style on the pitch , and who often just do n't deserve the victories they eek out of their matches . whatever the outcome of this tournament highlight - for 90 minutes tonight tens of millions of feverish fans will shout and cry , hope and pray and watch as the better team plays its way to victory . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thirsty fans drink portugal dry sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . -lrb- 14 june 2004 -rrb- sweden crushes bulgaria lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

" there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .
" but we must pursue our policies because they are objectively necessary . " final results for the european parliament elections showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- with 21.5 percent of the vote , its worst postwar performance at a national poll .
the party fared little better in thuringia 's regional elections , taking just 14.5 percent of the vote , its third worst postwar result for a regional ballot . schröder acknowledged he has antagonized large numbers of voters with his unpopular package of welfare and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 . " of course it hurts when the support is n't there , " schröder said on monday before meeting with party leaders to discuss the electoral fiasco .
" but it is my firm conviction that this policy is necessary for our country . " party dissent but not all spd party leaders agree .
the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .
" when everywhere you look reforms are being pushed through without giving people any perspective on how they 're going to benefit , then they just become fearful , " harald schartau told the german business daily , handelsblatt .
" we ca n't just go on doling out the bitter medicine .
rather , we have to make sure that the remedies are effective . " schartau said it 's now up to the spd to win back its core supporters .
" spd voters are watching very keenly to see if their interests are being represented in the reforms , and if the resulting policies are socially balanced . " industry-heavy nrw has traditionally been a stronghold for the spd , and it 's also where the party is pinning its hopes for a significant turnaround to stop its run of defeats .
nrw will hold regional elections next may .
if the spd were to lose , the conservatives would then have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . analysts say such a scenario would usher in a period of political paralysis that would last until germany 's next parliamentary elections in 2006 . regaining trust many commentators in the german media doubt schröder 's ability to hold on to the spd 's voters .
for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .
" it needs to become clear to people that agenda 2010 will eventually benefit everyone , not just a few , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : resigned to defeat ?

business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .

a german meteorological institute has just the thing . if you listen to a few weather reports in germany , you 'll soon notice that , in addition to hurricanes , high and low pressure systems also have names .

a court in berlin ruled in 2001 that the attack on la belle disco , which was frequented by u.s. soldiers , was planned by libya 's secret service .
the court then convicted verena chanaa , a german who planted the bomb , to 14 years in prison .
yassir chraidi , a palestinian , was also found guilty and sentenced to 13 years .
two other , musbah abdulghasem eter and ali chanaa , a libyan and lebanese-born german respectively , received 12-year sentences each .
prosecutors are now arguing that the sentences were too lenient although they have not specified how much they want the punishments raised .
in the case of the three men , the prosecution is arguing that while they were convicted as accessories , they should have been sentenced as accomplices .
defense lawyers are also appealing , but want the sentences of the four reduced . dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .
the talks will continue in june .

the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .

gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .

business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .

the fight is about how much power the european commission should have over the co-ordination of economic policy in the member states .
while germany - along with poland , italy and greece - want the power of the brussels executive to reprimand member states on their budget deficits to be curbed , the netherlands is fighting equally hard to see the commission get more powers .
the dutch fight comes after its fury last year when germany and france manoeuvred themselves out of getting a fine from brussels after which the stability pact - which underpins the euro - was effectively suspended .
speaking after the meeting in luxembourg , dutch foreign minister bernard bot said his country would fight " to the bitter end " for stronger powers for the commission .
he said he was " angry " that germany had been among the four member states sending a letter to the irish eu presidency for a watering down of the declaration on the stability pact - which had been proposed by dublin on the basis of a german-dutch compromise .
despite this quarrel , the irish presidency put a brave face on the matter .
irish foreign minister brian cowen said that meeting had been " very productive " .
he added , " we are therefore well-positioned to have a short , focused agenda when the heads of state or government meet on thursday " .
however , despite mr cowen 's optimism , some other big issues also remain open such as the legal status of the charter of fundamental rights , whether or not there should be a reference to christianity and all of the sensitive institutional questions .
on the last issue , dublin is set to produce a paper ahead of the summit .

the fight is about how much power the european commission should have over the co-ordination of economic policy in the member states .
while germany - along with poland , italy and greece - want the power of the brussels executive to reprimand member states on their budget deficits to be curbed , the netherlands is fighting equally hard to see the commission get more powers .
the dutch fight comes after its fury last year when germany and france manoeuvred themselves out of getting a fine from brussels after which the stability pact - which underpins the euro - was effectively suspended .
speaking after the meeting in luxembourg , dutch foreign minister bernard bot said his country would fight " to the bitter end " for stronger powers for the commission .
he said he was " angry " that germany had been among the four member states sending a letter to the irish eu presidency for a watering down of the declaration on the stability pact - which had been proposed by dublin on the basis of a german-dutch compromise .
despite this quarrel , the irish presidency put a brave face on the matter .
irish foreign minister brian cowen said that meeting had been " very productive " .
he added , " we are therefore well-positioned to have a short , focused agenda when the heads of state or government meet on thursday " .
however , despite mr cowen 's optimism , some other big issues also remain open such as the legal status of the charter of fundamental rights , whether or not there should be a reference to christianity and all of the sensitive institutional questions .
on the last issue , dublin is set to produce a paper ahead of the summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.06.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc meps consider new centrist political group as yet , all doors are still open - but the three main parties that it could concern - the centre-right epp , the socialists and the liberals - will start consulting at a high-level to see which parties could eventually come together .
at stake is the balance of power in the european parliament .
as it stands , the center-right group is leading with 274 seats , the socialists with 198 while the liberals have 64 .
liberal leader graham watson believes that his group will still hold the " pivotal role " between the two bigger groups .
but how this will pan out is still not clear .
speaking in brussels , watson said he would have meetings in the coming days with both romano prodi , the figurehead of the new italian pro-european olive tree coalition , and francois bayrou , the head of the centrist udf .
" i am looking not just for numbers and technical alliances but for a group which has a political program as its base " , said the liberal leader .
currently , some elements of the olive tree sit with the centre-right as does all of the udf - which leaves the epp in an interesting position .
already under fire from within its own ranks and from other groups for sheltering diverse parties under its very broad political umbrella , the epp could find itself deserted by its core federalists and left with a strong euroskeptic element with the uk conservatives as well as the euroskeptic czech party , the ods .

at stake is the balance of power in the european parliament .
as it stands , the center-right group is leading with 274 seats , the socialists with 198 while the liberals have 64 .
liberal leader graham watson believes that his group will still hold the " pivotal role " between the two bigger groups .
but how this will pan out is still not clear .
speaking in brussels , watson said he would have meetings in the coming days with both romano prodi , the figurehead of the new italian pro-european olive tree coalition , and francois bayrou , the head of the centrist udf .
" i am looking not just for numbers and technical alliances but for a group which has a political program as its base " , said the liberal leader .
currently , some elements of the olive tree sit with the centre-right as does all of the udf - which leaves the epp in an interesting position .
already under fire from within its own ranks and from other groups for sheltering diverse parties under its very broad political umbrella , the epp could find itself deserted by its core federalists and left with a strong euroskeptic element with the uk conservatives as well as the euroskeptic czech party , the ods .

but even a strong line of defense might not be enough to stave of the determination of the dutch side , which has the greater talent of the two teams .
that said , just as dutch coach dick advocaat 's men have a bit of a reputation for under-achieving at major events , the german team have a miraculous ability to pull it off at the last minute . it 's a well-known fact and a source of contempt for some in the netherlands , who claim the fear they used to feel when their squad was pitched against germany has long since turned into pity .
they pity the lot of a team comprised of anti-soccer artists , players who defend their way to last-minute victory , who have no style on the pitch , and who often just do n't deserve the victories they eek out of their matches . whatever the outcome of this tournament highlight - for 90 minutes tonight tens of millions of feverish fans will shout and cry , hope and pray and watch as the better team plays its way to victory . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thirsty fans drink portugal dry sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . -lrb- 14 june 2004 -rrb- sweden crushes bulgaria lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

" there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .
" but we must pursue our policies because they are objectively necessary . " final results for the european parliament elections showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- with 21.5 percent of the vote , its worst postwar performance at a national poll .
the party fared little better in thuringia 's regional elections , taking just 14.5 percent of the vote , its third worst postwar result for a regional ballot . schröder acknowledged he has antagonized large numbers of voters with his unpopular package of welfare and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 .

the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .

for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .

the epp wants to choose its candidate on wednesday night , on the eve the eu summit where member states will decide who will be future chief of the brussels executive .
the most likely candidate to be " appointed " by the conservatives is the luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , although he keeps denying his interest in the position .
but after a recent tour of eu capitals , irish prime minister and president of the european council bertie ahern said : " everybody wants him . "
ahern , however , is also still in the race for the top post himself .
another conservative candidate could possibly be austrian prime minister wolfgang schüssel , but he risks being vetoed by paris - because of his willingness to form a coalition in 2000 with the far-right freedom party in austria .
by choosing its own candidate , the epp wants to hinder the election of the belgian liberal prime minister guy verhofstadt as commission president .
however , according to the financial times deutschland , sources in the german and french governments say the two countries are set to push verhofstadt as the common franco-german candidate at the eu summit .

the epp wants to choose its candidate on wednesday night , on the eve the eu summit where member states will decide who will be future chief of the brussels executive .
the most likely candidate to be " appointed " by the conservatives is the luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , although he keeps denying his interest in the position .
but after a recent tour of eu capitals , irish prime minister and president of the european council bertie ahern said : " everybody wants him . "
ahern , however , is also still in the race for the top post himself .
another conservative candidate could possibly be austrian prime minister wolfgang schüssel , but he risks being vetoed by paris - because of his willingness to form a coalition in 2000 with the far-right freedom party in austria .
by choosing its own candidate , the epp wants to hinder the election of the belgian liberal prime minister guy verhofstadt as commission president .
however , according to the financial times deutschland , sources in the german and french governments say the two countries are set to push verhofstadt as the common franco-german candidate at the eu summit .

they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?

they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?

pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?
troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing .

the neues deutschland from berlin said that the social democrats " feel like victims on behalf of their people and their fatherland , " for their unpopular reform agenda . but the " bigger victims " of the agenda are the people , the paper said , and it calls the green party " the only political power which can bring the social democrats to their senses and to self-preservation . "
the greens are the social democrats ' coalition partner .
thus , the paper suggested , the greens can " set new a new course " for the government .
but by refusing to do so , the greens seem also to be expecting " only to govern for two more years . "
so the neues deutschland concluded that the red-green coalition " must have a death wish . " die welt , also from berlin , pointed to the words of chancellor gerhard schröder after the election losses : " i can only go ahead with the current policies , and i only want to go ahead with the current policies . " the words remind the daily of martin luther , who insisted " here i stand ; i ca n't do otherwise . "
luther 's statement , the paper said , " led to the break-up " of the christian church ; schröder 's " just indicate a sullen resignation . " the handelsblatt from düsseldorf wrote schröder has gone from being a leader of his party to one of those being led .
" critics within the social democrats had forced schröder 's resignation as party head , " and " now they are calling for a cabinet reshuffle . " the freie presse from chemnitz in eastern germany also predicted schröder 's demise .
it compared him to former conservative chancellor helmut kohl . " during kohl 's sunset , he tried half-heartedly to reform the crusty old system , " the paper wrote .
" schröder himself came into power with populist promises to undo kohl 's mini-reforms . "
but now the conservatives " wo n't profit much from the loss of face of the social democrats " because " they are also responsible for " current policy .
the paper guessed that all in all the consequences will be that " great parties will shrink to relatively small parties . " the stuttgarter zeitung took the same line and imagined that " if the conservatives were in power , things would n't be different for them .
it 's easy to celebrate a victory , give big speeches and pitch yourself as an alternative , even if you 've also been partly responsible for the poor policy , " the daily commented .
" sometimes it 's fun to be in the opposition . " and the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle accused the social democrats of being " intellectually and emotionally unprepared " to implement reforms .

the neues deutschland from berlin said that the social democrats " feel like victims on behalf of their people and their fatherland , " for their unpopular reform agenda . but the " bigger victims " of the agenda are the people , the paper said , and it calls the green party " the only political power which can bring the social democrats to their senses and to self-preservation .

thus , the paper suggested , the greens can " set new a new course " for the government .
but by refusing to do so , the greens seem also to be expecting " only to govern for two more years . "
so the neues deutschland concluded that the red-green coalition " must have a death wish .

luther 's statement , the paper said , " led to the break-up " of the christian church ; schröder 's " just indicate a sullen resignation . " the handelsblatt from düsseldorf wrote schröder has gone from being a leader of his party to one of those being led .
" critics within the social democrats had forced schröder 's resignation as party head , " and " now they are calling for a cabinet reshuffle . " the freie presse from chemnitz in eastern germany also predicted schröder 's demise .

according to the dihk , growth rates in germany comparable to those in the u.s. are not likely .
its analysts said the nation 's high unemployment rate and weak consumer demand will keep growth down to 1 to 1.5 percent .

stagnant domestic demand is the culprit , according to the firms polled , in addition to a cooling of the global economy , which will in turn depress german exports , the only factor that has been driving the country 's weak recovery .
according to the dihk , growth rates in germany comparable to those in the u.s. are not likely .
its analysts said the nation 's high unemployment rate and weak consumer demand will keep growth down to 1 to 1.5 percent .
the economy is fairly robust now , the dihk said , but there are clouds on the horizon - namely climbing oil prices and several warning signs that inflation rates could start rising . more briefs 15.06.2004 -pipe- german drugmaker schering to cut 900 jobs 14.06.2004 -pipe- lufthansa threatens job cuts 14.06.2004 -pipe- priciest city list shows weak dollar 's effect 14.06.2004 -pipe- three months later , business confidence still low 12.06.2004 -pipe- high-speed train station opens at cologne-bonn airport 12.06.2004 -pipe- new zeppelin 's makers sell first airship 11.06.2004 -pipe- vw moves to boost output in china 11.06.2004 -pipe- publisher may branch into postal business radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

group d favorite the czech republic barely managed to avoid a humiliating defeat on tuesday , coming from behind to thwart an early latvian lead to win 2-1 . it would have been the biggest upset yet at euro 2004 , but unfortunately for tiny latvia it was not meant to be .
despite the clear dominance of the czechs , the latvians were able to score first and stay ahead for most of the match . aware of their underdog status , latvia still came to the pitch confident of being able to win or very least hold the czechs to a draw .
latvian coach aleksandrs starkovs said before the game that greece 's opening day shock win over hosts portugal proved anything was possible .
" the portugal result is a lesson on how the little teams can beat the favorites , " starkovs said . that attitude was clearly spread to the entire squad , because the latvians were n't afraid to take their chances when they presented themselves .
the surprise lead came right before halftime when maris verpakovskis sunk a pointblank shot that stunned the czechs . bildunterschrift : the czechs answered by peppering the latvian goal with shots , however , keeper aleksandrs kolinko was able to handle everything that came his way . the favorites came back from the break hoping to quickly equalize , but czech captain and juventus star pavel nedved and his teammates were unable to put anything past kolinko .
only in the 73rd minute was milan baros able to bring the czechs level after the lativan keeper deflected a corner . after that shook up the latvians , the czechs kept the pressure on and marek heinz put the czechs ahead in the 85th minute . after the tough win czech midfielder tomas rosicky conceeded the lativans were n't as easy as had been hoped .

only in the 73rd minute was milan baros able to bring the czechs level after the lativan keeper deflected a corner . after that shook up the latvians , the czechs kept the pressure on and marek heinz put the czechs ahead in the 85th minute . after the tough win czech midfielder tomas rosicky conceeded the lativans were n't as easy as had been hoped .
" that was certainly the hardest match of the group .
against holland and germany it will definitely be easier , " rosicky said . lineups : czech republic : petr cech ; zdenek grygera , tomas galasek , rene bolf , marek jankulovski , karel poborsky , jan koller , tomas rosicky , pavel nedved , milan baros , tomas ujfalusi . latvia : aleksandrs kolinko , igors stepanovs , vitalijs astafjevs , mihails zemlinskis , olegs blagonadezdins , aleksandrs isakofvs , imants bleidelis , maris verpakovskis , andrejs rubins , andrejs prohorenkovs , valentis lobanovs . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group d : germany , holland , latvia , czech republic the so-called " group of death " puts three top teams up against each other in a fight to avoid the second elimination spot as it looks inevitable that latvia will claim the first at the end of the group stage .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .
the fact that he is old , and in ill health is no reason to not have him in prison .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .
the fact that he is old , and in ill health is no reason to not have him in prison .
he should be held responsible for his crimes . - kristine stuef , canada papon belongs in prison .
i subscribe to the feelings of the wiesenthal center .

or just want to see your name on a weather map ?
a german meteorological institute has just the thing . if you listen to a few weather reports in germany , you 'll soon notice that , in addition to hurricanes , high and low pressure systems also have names .
it 's been that way since 1954 , thanks to the meteorological institute at berlin 's free university , which baptizes the weather systems . but about two years ago , the cost-savings measures that have been felt across all of germany threatened to hit the meteorological institute as well .
a weather monitoring system that has been in operation since 1907 was faced with closure due to lack of funds . creative solution that 's when the institute 's thomas dümmel had an idea : just as people pay to adopt a highway or a dolphin , buy a plot on the moon or name a star , why not allow germans to buy the right to name a high or low pressure system ? stefan lichius , a self-confessed weather freak from cologne loved the idea , and immediately bought three names .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 15.06.2004 a retrial for papon ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maurice papon is still seeking to clear his name the french high court has refused the country ’ s most famous nazi collaborator a retrial , but should 93-year-old maurice papon have the chance to get his war criminal conviction overturned ?
dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .
the fact that he is old , and in ill health is no reason to not have him in prison .
he should be held responsible for his crimes . - kristine stuef , canada papon belongs in prison .
i subscribe to the feelings of the wiesenthal center .
" misplaced sympathy " is the correct diagnosis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.06.2004 schröder and chirac in sync ahead of eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac share a laugh at aachen 's cathedral the german and french leaders are going into a brussels eu summit this week with common positions on the nomination of the next commission president and reaching a deal for europe 's first constitution . meeting in the former seat of emperor charlemagne , a symbol of european unity , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on monday sought to tackle a smorgasbord of european political issues in aachen - from selecting a new european commission president to resolving conflicts over the draft constitution .
they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?
troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing .

they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?
troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .

pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .

neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.06.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc german court reexamines berlin bombing case a federal appeals court in leipzig is reviewing the sentences handed down in the case of the 1986 bomb attack on a disco in berlin that killed three people and injured more than 200 .
a court in berlin ruled in 2001 that the attack on la belle disco , which was frequented by u.s. soldiers , was planned by libya 's secret service .
the court then convicted verena chanaa , a german who planted the bomb , to 14 years in prison .
yassir chraidi , a palestinian , was also found guilty and sentenced to 13 years .
two other , musbah abdulghasem eter and ali chanaa , a libyan and lebanese-born german respectively , received 12-year sentences each .
prosecutors are now arguing that the sentences were too lenient although they have not specified how much they want the punishments raised .
in the case of the three men , the prosecution is arguing that while they were convicted as accessories , they should have been sentenced as accomplices .
defense lawyers are also appealing , but want the sentences of the four reduced . dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .
the talks will continue in june .

" there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .
" but we must pursue our policies because they are objectively necessary . " final results for the european parliament elections showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- with 21.5 percent of the vote , its worst postwar performance at a national poll .
the party fared little better in thuringia 's regional elections , taking just 14.5 percent of the vote , its third worst postwar result for a regional ballot . schröder acknowledged he has antagonized large numbers of voters with his unpopular package of welfare and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 . " of course it hurts when the support is n't there , " schröder said on monday before meeting with party leaders to discuss the electoral fiasco .
" but it is my firm conviction that this policy is necessary for our country . " party dissent but not all spd party leaders agree .
the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .
" when everywhere you look reforms are being pushed through without giving people any perspective on how they 're going to benefit , then they just become fearful , " harald schartau told the german business daily , handelsblatt .
" we ca n't just go on doling out the bitter medicine .
rather , we have to make sure that the remedies are effective . " schartau said it 's now up to the spd to win back its core supporters .
" spd voters are watching very keenly to see if their interests are being represented in the reforms , and if the resulting policies are socially balanced . " industry-heavy nrw has traditionally been a stronghold for the spd , and it 's also where the party is pinning its hopes for a significant turnaround to stop its run of defeats .
nrw will hold regional elections next may .
if the spd were to lose , the conservatives would then have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . analysts say such a scenario would usher in a period of political paralysis that would last until germany 's next parliamentary elections in 2006 . regaining trust many commentators in the german media doubt schröder 's ability to hold on to the spd 's voters .
for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .
" it needs to become clear to people that agenda 2010 will eventually benefit everyone , not just a few , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : resigned to defeat ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2004 germany gets back its appetite for mergers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank says it 's ready to go on a shopping spree after a lull period , new life is being breathed into the german market for mergers and acquisitions .
business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .

the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .
" when everywhere you look reforms are being pushed through without giving people any perspective on how they 're going to benefit , then they just become fearful , " harald schartau told the german business daily , handelsblatt .
" we ca n't just go on doling out the bitter medicine .
rather , we have to make sure that the remedies are effective . " schartau said it 's now up to the spd to win back its core supporters .
" spd voters are watching very keenly to see if their interests are being represented in the reforms , and if the resulting policies are socially balanced . " industry-heavy nrw has traditionally been a stronghold for the spd , and it 's also where the party is pinning its hopes for a significant turnaround to stop its run of defeats .
nrw will hold regional elections next may .
if the spd were to lose , the conservatives would then have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . analysts say such a scenario would usher in a period of political paralysis that would last until germany 's next parliamentary elections in 2006 . regaining trust many commentators in the german media doubt schröder 's ability to hold on to the spd 's voters .
for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .
" it needs to become clear to people that agenda 2010 will eventually benefit everyone , not just a few , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : resigned to defeat ?

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .
but now the mortified frustration has been transformed into hopeful anticipation .
players and fans alike know they can do better , and have no intention of breaking their record of never losing a first round match in a european championship tournament . painting the town orange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch fans while the germans are marking the big showdown tonight with parties , celebrations and the erection of huge inner-city screens , the dutch are taking their momentary obsession one step further , swamping the little country in the national team 's color : orange .
entire city districts have been wrapped in orange , newspapers , which generally stick to the traditional black and white , have been injected with a dose of color and streets and even sidewalks have been painted over . besides the vibrant display of support for the boys who have traveled to portugal to defend the soccer honor of a nation , which in non-tournament times fails to generate much passion for the sport , there are gentle jokes aimed at their opponents .
it 's a side sport , a bi-product of the championships , and germany is at it too .
some berliners decided to cover up the name of their street , hollandstrasse , until after the match , and the boulevard press has become more pointed than usual . may the best team win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler germany coach rudi völler has already made it clear that the focus of the match will be on defense , and he is expected to opt for a formation with kevin kuranyi as the only striker .
but even a strong line of defense might not be enough to stave of the determination of the dutch side , which has the greater talent of the two teams .
that said , just as dutch coach dick advocaat 's men have a bit of a reputation for under-achieving at major events , the german team have a miraculous ability to pull it off at the last minute . it 's a well-known fact and a source of contempt for some in the netherlands , who claim the fear they used to feel when their squad was pitched against germany has long since turned into pity .
they pity the lot of a team comprised of anti-soccer artists , players who defend their way to last-minute victory , who have no style on the pitch , and who often just do n't deserve the victories they eek out of their matches . whatever the outcome of this tournament highlight - for 90 minutes tonight tens of millions of feverish fans will shout and cry , hope and pray and watch as the better team plays its way to victory . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thirsty fans drink portugal dry sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . -lrb- 14 june 2004 -rrb- sweden crushes bulgaria lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.06.2004 staying the course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discussing defeat : schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and spd chairman müntefering despite crushing defeats for the social democratic party in sunday 's european and regional elections , chancellor gerhard schröder pledged to press ahead with his unpopular economic reform program . schröder stamped out speculations of a cabinet reshuffle or a reversal on his reform policies following his party 's poor showing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia . " there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .
" but we must pursue our policies because they are objectively necessary . " final results for the european parliament elections showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- with 21.5 percent of the vote , its worst postwar performance at a national poll .
the party fared little better in thuringia 's regional elections , taking just 14.5 percent of the vote , its third worst postwar result for a regional ballot . schröder acknowledged he has antagonized large numbers of voters with his unpopular package of welfare and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 . " of course it hurts when the support is n't there , " schröder said on monday before meeting with party leaders to discuss the electoral fiasco .
" but it is my firm conviction that this policy is necessary for our country . " party dissent but not all spd party leaders agree .
the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .
" when everywhere you look reforms are being pushed through without giving people any perspective on how they 're going to benefit , then they just become fearful , " harald schartau told the german business daily , handelsblatt .
" we ca n't just go on doling out the bitter medicine .
rather , we have to make sure that the remedies are effective . " schartau said it 's now up to the spd to win back its core supporters .
" spd voters are watching very keenly to see if their interests are being represented in the reforms , and if the resulting policies are socially balanced . " industry-heavy nrw has traditionally been a stronghold for the spd , and it 's also where the party is pinning its hopes for a significant turnaround to stop its run of defeats .
nrw will hold regional elections next may .
if the spd were to lose , the conservatives would then have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . analysts say such a scenario would usher in a period of political paralysis that would last until germany 's next parliamentary elections in 2006 . regaining trust many commentators in the german media doubt schröder 's ability to hold on to the spd 's voters .
for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .
" it needs to become clear to people that agenda 2010 will eventually benefit everyone , not just a few , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : resigned to defeat ?
tuesday 's german editorials again looked at the massive losses in support for germany 's ruling social democrats in the european parliamentary elections .
-lrb- june 15 , 2004 -rrb- social democrats suffer double defeat german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats took a drubbing in elections for the european parliament , as well as regional elections in the eastern state of thuringia , raising doubts about the party 's future .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .
the fact that he is old , and in ill health is no reason to not have him in prison .
he should be held responsible for his crimes . - kristine stuef , canada papon belongs in prison .
i subscribe to the feelings of the wiesenthal center .
" misplaced sympathy " is the correct diagnosis .
what kind of human being is he ? - michael schwartz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french court rejects retrial of nazi collaborator france 's highest court rejected the request for a retrial by the country ’ s most famous nazi collaborator on friday : ninety-three year old maurice papon will not get a chance to fight his conviction for war crimes .

group d favorite the czech republic barely managed to avoid a humiliating defeat on tuesday , coming from behind to thwart an early latvian lead to win 2-1 . it would have been the biggest upset yet at euro 2004 , but unfortunately for tiny latvia it was not meant to be .
despite the clear dominance of the czechs , the latvians were able to score first and stay ahead for most of the match . aware of their underdog status , latvia still came to the pitch confident of being able to win or very least hold the czechs to a draw .
latvian coach aleksandrs starkovs said before the game that greece 's opening day shock win over hosts portugal proved anything was possible .
" the portugal result is a lesson on how the little teams can beat the favorites , " starkovs said . that attitude was clearly spread to the entire squad , because the latvians were n't afraid to take their chances when they presented themselves .
the surprise lead came right before halftime when maris verpakovskis sunk a pointblank shot that stunned the czechs . bildunterschrift : the czechs answered by peppering the latvian goal with shots , however , keeper aleksandrs kolinko was able to handle everything that came his way . the favorites came back from the break hoping to quickly equalize , but czech captain and juventus star pavel nedved and his teammates were unable to put anything past kolinko .
only in the 73rd minute was milan baros able to bring the czechs level after the lativan keeper deflected a corner . after that shook up the latvians , the czechs kept the pressure on and marek heinz put the czechs ahead in the 85th minute . after the tough win czech midfielder tomas rosicky conceeded the lativans were n't as easy as had been hoped .
" that was certainly the hardest match of the group .

group d favorite the czech republic barely managed to avoid a humiliating defeat on tuesday , coming from behind to thwart an early latvian lead to win 2-1 . it would have been the biggest upset yet at euro 2004 , but unfortunately for tiny latvia it was not meant to be .
despite the clear dominance of the czechs , the latvians were able to score first and stay ahead for most of the match . aware of their underdog status , latvia still came to the pitch confident of being able to win or very least hold the czechs to a draw .
latvian coach aleksandrs starkovs said before the game that greece 's opening day shock win over hosts portugal proved anything was possible .
" the portugal result is a lesson on how the little teams can beat the favorites , " starkovs said . that attitude was clearly spread to the entire squad , because the latvians were n't afraid to take their chances when they presented themselves .

only in the 73rd minute was milan baros able to bring the czechs level after the lativan keeper deflected a corner . after that shook up the latvians , the czechs kept the pressure on and marek heinz put the czechs ahead in the 85th minute . after the tough win czech midfielder tomas rosicky conceeded the lativans were n't as easy as had been hoped .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.06.2004 schröder and chirac in sync ahead of eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac share a laugh at aachen 's cathedral the german and french leaders are going into a brussels eu summit this week with common positions on the nomination of the next commission president and reaching a deal for europe 's first constitution . meeting in the former seat of emperor charlemagne , a symbol of european unity , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on monday sought to tackle a smorgasbord of european political issues in aachen - from selecting a new european commission president to resolving conflicts over the draft constitution .
they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?
troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .
the fact that he is old , and in ill health is no reason to not have him in prison .
he should be held responsible for his crimes . - kristine stuef , canada papon belongs in prison .

" there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .
" but we must pursue our policies because they are objectively necessary . " final results for the european parliament elections showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- with 21.5 percent of the vote , its worst postwar performance at a national poll .
the party fared little better in thuringia 's regional elections , taking just 14.5 percent of the vote , its third worst postwar result for a regional ballot . schröder acknowledged he has antagonized large numbers of voters with his unpopular package of welfare and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 . " of course it hurts when the support is n't there , " schröder said on monday before meeting with party leaders to discuss the electoral fiasco .
" but it is my firm conviction that this policy is necessary for our country . " party dissent but not all spd party leaders agree .
the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .
" when everywhere you look reforms are being pushed through without giving people any perspective on how they 're going to benefit , then they just become fearful , " harald schartau told the german business daily , handelsblatt .
" we ca n't just go on doling out the bitter medicine .
rather , we have to make sure that the remedies are effective . " schartau said it 's now up to the spd to win back its core supporters .
" spd voters are watching very keenly to see if their interests are being represented in the reforms , and if the resulting policies are socially balanced . " industry-heavy nrw has traditionally been a stronghold for the spd , and it 's also where the party is pinning its hopes for a significant turnaround to stop its run of defeats .
nrw will hold regional elections next may .
if the spd were to lose , the conservatives would then have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . analysts say such a scenario would usher in a period of political paralysis that would last until germany 's next parliamentary elections in 2006 . regaining trust many commentators in the german media doubt schröder 's ability to hold on to the spd 's voters .
for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .

for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .
" it needs to become clear to people that agenda 2010 will eventually benefit everyone , not just a few , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : resigned to defeat ?

they also settled a dispute over industrial policy , saying they would meet regularly along with leading industrialists on both sides of the rhine river in order to prevent conflicts such as this spring 's saber rattling over siemens ' proposed acquisition of units from beleaguered alstom .
though the two leaders have an informal face-to-face every six weeks , the meeting was this first since this weekend 's european parliamentary election , which brought heavy losses for schröder 's social democratic and chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- parties .
but on monday , both leaders sought to convey optimism and confidence .
painful reforms being undertaken by the governments in berlin and paris , they said , need to be pushed forward , even if voters resist them .
schröder even acknowledged the pain cuts to the social system had brought to average germans as well as their fears about germany 's role in an enlarged europe .
searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?

searching for a commissioner the leaders expressed unity on the entire palette of eu issues on the table .
the countries want to attend the eu summit on thursday and friday in brussels with shared positions on the constitution and the selection of the next european commission president .
though neither leader named any potential candidates , german government sources have told major national newspapers that schröder favors liberal belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt .
the british have opposed any nomination of verhofstadt to lead the eu executive because it could further alienate brussels from washington .
this weekend 's parliamentary elections could also make it difficult to push through a liberal candidate , since the center-right european people 's party scored the biggest number of seats in the strasbourg-based european parliament .
but on monday , neither schröder nor chirac sought to push the envelope .
" i think the irish presidency will suggest a candidate with broad support , " schröder said .
" france and germany will also work very closely together to forge a common position on this issue . "
pushing for a constitution deal schröder and chirac said they also remain a united front on the european constitution , which has been stalled since delegates failed to agree on a draft at an eu summit in december following a dispute over the vote weighing of the so-called double-majority principle .
" i can tell you that the principle of the double majority is not being questioned , " schröder said , adding that the member states just needed to find rules for the voting mechanism that could be agreed to by all .
france and germany are demanding that their countries , the most populous in europe , will have more votes at their disposal in eu decisions than poland and spain , which though large in land mass have smaller populations .
increasing industrial cooperation the leaders also sought to smooth over a recent bilateral dispute over the country 's respective industrial policies .
with the stated goal of creating european sector leaders in core industries , schröder and chirac said they would convene regularly for industrial policy summits that would also be attended by leading industrial representatives from france and germany .
earlier this spring , a dispute between berlin and french finance minister nicolas sarkozy strained bilateral relations .
sarkozy sought to prevent german industrial giant siemens from buying divisions of the beleaguered french alstom in a style many in schröder 's cabinet felt reeked of nationalism .
on monday , schröder described a climate of " misunderstandings " and " absence of political sensitivity . "
it was the second time in a year that the two countries locked horns over industrial policy .
germany also expressed distaste over paris 's handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by the french firm sanofi synthélabo , which schröder 's government also felt was motivated by national interests . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all or nothing for alstom ?

the neues deutschland from berlin said that the social democrats " feel like victims on behalf of their people and their fatherland , " for their unpopular reform agenda . but the " bigger victims " of the agenda are the people , the paper said , and it calls the green party " the only political power which can bring the social democrats to their senses and to self-preservation . "
the greens are the social democrats ' coalition partner .
thus , the paper suggested , the greens can " set new a new course " for the government .
but by refusing to do so , the greens seem also to be expecting " only to govern for two more years . "
so the neues deutschland concluded that the red-green coalition " must have a death wish . " die welt , also from berlin , pointed to the words of chancellor gerhard schröder after the election losses : " i can only go ahead with the current policies , and i only want to go ahead with the current policies . " the words remind the daily of martin luther , who insisted " here i stand ; i ca n't do otherwise . "
luther 's statement , the paper said , " led to the break-up " of the christian church ; schröder 's " just indicate a sullen resignation . " the handelsblatt from düsseldorf wrote schröder has gone from being a leader of his party to one of those being led .
" critics within the social democrats had forced schröder 's resignation as party head , " and " now they are calling for a cabinet reshuffle . " the freie presse from chemnitz in eastern germany also predicted schröder 's demise .
it compared him to former conservative chancellor helmut kohl . " during kohl 's sunset , he tried half-heartedly to reform the crusty old system , " the paper wrote .
" schröder himself came into power with populist promises to undo kohl 's mini-reforms . "
but now the conservatives " wo n't profit much from the loss of face of the social democrats " because " they are also responsible for " current policy .
the paper guessed that all in all the consequences will be that " great parties will shrink to relatively small parties . " the stuttgarter zeitung took the same line and imagined that " if the conservatives were in power , things would n't be different for them .
it 's easy to celebrate a victory , give big speeches and pitch yourself as an alternative , even if you 've also been partly responsible for the poor policy , " the daily commented .
" sometimes it 's fun to be in the opposition . " and the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle accused the social democrats of being " intellectually and emotionally unprepared " to implement reforms .

the neues deutschland from berlin said that the social democrats " feel like victims on behalf of their people and their fatherland , " for their unpopular reform agenda . but the " bigger victims " of the agenda are the people , the paper said , and it calls the green party " the only political power which can bring the social democrats to their senses and to self-preservation . "
the greens are the social democrats ' coalition partner .
thus , the paper suggested , the greens can " set new a new course " for the government .
but by refusing to do so , the greens seem also to be expecting " only to govern for two more years . "
so the neues deutschland concluded that the red-green coalition " must have a death wish . " die welt , also from berlin , pointed to the words of chancellor gerhard schröder after the election losses : " i can only go ahead with the current policies , and i only want to go ahead with the current policies . " the words remind the daily of martin luther , who insisted " here i stand ; i ca n't do otherwise . "
luther 's statement , the paper said , " led to the break-up " of the christian church ; schröder 's " just indicate a sullen resignation . " the handelsblatt from düsseldorf wrote schröder has gone from being a leader of his party to one of those being led .
" critics within the social democrats had forced schröder 's resignation as party head , " and " now they are calling for a cabinet reshuffle . " the freie presse from chemnitz in eastern germany also predicted schröder 's demise .
it compared him to former conservative chancellor helmut kohl . " during kohl 's sunset , he tried half-heartedly to reform the crusty old system , " the paper wrote .
" schröder himself came into power with populist promises to undo kohl 's mini-reforms . "
but now the conservatives " wo n't profit much from the loss of face of the social democrats " because " they are also responsible for " current policy .
the paper guessed that all in all the consequences will be that " great parties will shrink to relatively small parties . " the stuttgarter zeitung took the same line and imagined that " if the conservatives were in power , things would n't be different for them .
it 's easy to celebrate a victory , give big speeches and pitch yourself as an alternative , even if you 've also been partly responsible for the poor policy , " the daily commented .
" sometimes it 's fun to be in the opposition . " and the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle accused the social democrats of being " intellectually and emotionally unprepared " to implement reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.06.2004 germany gets back its appetite for mergers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank says it 's ready to go on a shopping spree after a lull period , new life is being breathed into the german market for mergers and acquisitions .
business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .
-lrb- april 26 , 2004 -rrb- air france-klm merger approved air france and royal dutch airlines -lrb- klm -rrb- will become the world 's largest airline in terms of revenue after european and u.s. authorities approved the deal .

group d favorite the czech republic barely managed to avoid a humiliating defeat on tuesday , coming from behind to thwart an early latvian lead to win 2-1 . it would have been the biggest upset yet at euro 2004 , but unfortunately for tiny latvia it was not meant to be .
despite the clear dominance of the czechs , the latvians were able to score first and stay ahead for most of the match . aware of their underdog status , latvia still came to the pitch confident of being able to win or very least hold the czechs to a draw .
latvian coach aleksandrs starkovs said before the game that greece 's opening day shock win over hosts portugal proved anything was possible .
" the portugal result is a lesson on how the little teams can beat the favorites , " starkovs said . that attitude was clearly spread to the entire squad , because the latvians were n't afraid to take their chances when they presented themselves .
the surprise lead came right before halftime when maris verpakovskis sunk a pointblank shot that stunned the czechs . bildunterschrift : the czechs answered by peppering the latvian goal with shots , however , keeper aleksandrs kolinko was able to handle everything that came his way . the favorites came back from the break hoping to quickly equalize , but czech captain and juventus star pavel nedved and his teammates were unable to put anything past kolinko .
only in the 73rd minute was milan baros able to bring the czechs level after the lativan keeper deflected a corner . after that shook up the latvians , the czechs kept the pressure on and marek heinz put the czechs ahead in the 85th minute . after the tough win czech midfielder tomas rosicky conceeded the lativans were n't as easy as had been hoped .
" that was certainly the hardest match of the group .

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .

business is still sluggish , but talk of takeovers and mergers is picking up again in boardrooms . software giants microsoft and sap are discussing a possible merger ; banking giant commerzbank is in talks with holland 's ing to buy its german banking business , bhf bank ; and deutsche bank has declared it 's on the lookout for takeover candidates .
the headlines in recent days make it clear that there 's once again momentum in the mergers & acquisitions business .
" the climate has changed , as you can see in the merger discussions between microsoft and sap , " jan ising of the institute for mergers and acquisitions at witten-herdecke university in the town of witten near essen told dw-world .
" you can once again talk to a company about a fusion without being immediately shown the door . "
a bubble burst after the new economy bubble burst in germany in 2001 , mergers and acquisitions fell not only out of vogue , but also nearly out of the vocabulary .
and you do n't have to read tea leaves to understand why : the list of mergers and buyouts that benefited a handful of consultants and very few shareholders is long .
indeed , it runs from blue chip companies like car-maker daimlerchrysler to erstwhile telecommunications giant worldcom to the media conglomerate em.tv -lrb- former license owner of " the muppets . " -rrb-
abroad , the carousel of mega mergers has been spinning around ever more rapidly in recent years .
bank of america recently took over competitor fleetboston financial in a $ 47 billion -lrb- € 38.8 billion -rrb- transaction .
and this year deals have been sealed in a number of sectors .
in europe , air france acquired dutch flag carrier klm .
and over in asia , american brewing giant anheuser busch is buying the chinese harbin brewery and japanese internet service provider softbank took over japan telecom .
but germany is still limping behind other countries when it comes to mergers and acquisitions , ising suggests .
in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .

in recent years , german companies have mostly found themselves in the position of being the target of a bid rather than acting as the bidder .
u.s. media entrepreneur haim saban recently purchased german private tv broadcaster prosiebensat1 from the ashes of the kirch group bankruptcy , french pharmaceutical giant sanofi-synthelabo took over franco-german competitor aventis , and u.s. household goods concern proctor & gamble bought darmstadt-based wella ag .
gaining momentum " we 're limping behind because the stock market in germany has n't recovered as well as the international stock markets and most buys are made through share exchanges , " ising explains .
in addition , mergers in germany are often orchestrated by political actors rather than the markets , as demonstrated by the recent efforts by the government to orchestrate a takeover of the state-owned postbank by privately held deutsche bank .
nevertheless , mergers and acquisitions are once again being discussed at the executive level .
" a clear signal of the changing trend is that companies are searching for investment bankers again - not publicly , but the market is moving again , " ising says .
after all , most companies involved in m & a activities are first approached by investment banks .
ising says the sectors most likely to be effected by the new appetite for mergers and acquisitions are banking , the automobile industry and telecommunications .
in all three sectors , consolidation is both foreseeable and necessary .
but mergers to create new giants in the high tech and biotechnology industries are also to be expected , ising says . michael knigge -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aventis accepts sanofi bid the french-german pharmaceutical group aventis has agreed to merge with its french rival sanofi-synthelabo in a move that is expected to create the world 's third-largest drugs company .

" there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .
" but we must pursue our policies because they are objectively necessary . " final results for the european parliament elections showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- with 21.5 percent of the vote , its worst postwar performance at a national poll .
the party fared little better in thuringia 's regional elections , taking just 14.5 percent of the vote , its third worst postwar result for a regional ballot . schröder acknowledged he has antagonized large numbers of voters with his unpopular package of welfare and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 . " of course it hurts when the support is n't there , " schröder said on monday before meeting with party leaders to discuss the electoral fiasco .
" but it is my firm conviction that this policy is necessary for our country . " party dissent but not all spd party leaders agree .
the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .
" when everywhere you look reforms are being pushed through without giving people any perspective on how they 're going to benefit , then they just become fearful , " harald schartau told the german business daily , handelsblatt .
" we ca n't just go on doling out the bitter medicine .
rather , we have to make sure that the remedies are effective . " schartau said it 's now up to the spd to win back its core supporters .
" spd voters are watching very keenly to see if their interests are being represented in the reforms , and if the resulting policies are socially balanced . " industry-heavy nrw has traditionally been a stronghold for the spd , and it 's also where the party is pinning its hopes for a significant turnaround to stop its run of defeats .
nrw will hold regional elections next may .
if the spd were to lose , the conservatives would then have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . analysts say such a scenario would usher in a period of political paralysis that would last until germany 's next parliamentary elections in 2006 . regaining trust many commentators in the german media doubt schröder 's ability to hold on to the spd 's voters .
for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .
" it needs to become clear to people that agenda 2010 will eventually benefit everyone , not just a few , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : resigned to defeat ?

group d favorite the czech republic barely managed to avoid a humiliating defeat on tuesday , coming from behind to thwart an early latvian lead to win 2-1 . it would have been the biggest upset yet at euro 2004 , but unfortunately for tiny latvia it was not meant to be .
despite the clear dominance of the czechs , the latvians were able to score first and stay ahead for most of the match . aware of their underdog status , latvia still came to the pitch confident of being able to win or very least hold the czechs to a draw .
latvian coach aleksandrs starkovs said before the game that greece 's opening day shock win over hosts portugal proved anything was possible .
" the portugal result is a lesson on how the little teams can beat the favorites , " starkovs said . that attitude was clearly spread to the entire squad , because the latvians were n't afraid to take their chances when they presented themselves .
the surprise lead came right before halftime when maris verpakovskis sunk a pointblank shot that stunned the czechs . bildunterschrift : the czechs answered by peppering the latvian goal with shots , however , keeper aleksandrs kolinko was able to handle everything that came his way . the favorites came back from the break hoping to quickly equalize , but czech captain and juventus star pavel nedved and his teammates were unable to put anything past kolinko .
only in the 73rd minute was milan baros able to bring the czechs level after the lativan keeper deflected a corner . after that shook up the latvians , the czechs kept the pressure on and marek heinz put the czechs ahead in the 85th minute . after the tough win czech midfielder tomas rosicky conceeded the lativans were n't as easy as had been hoped .
" that was certainly the hardest match of the group .
against holland and germany it will definitely be easier , " rosicky said . lineups : czech republic : petr cech ; zdenek grygera , tomas galasek , rene bolf , marek jankulovski , karel poborsky , jan koller , tomas rosicky , pavel nedved , milan baros , tomas ujfalusi . latvia : aleksandrs kolinko , igors stepanovs , vitalijs astafjevs , mihails zemlinskis , olegs blagonadezdins , aleksandrs isakofvs , imants bleidelis , maris verpakovskis , andrejs rubins , andrejs prohorenkovs , valentis lobanovs . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de group d : germany , holland , latvia , czech republic the so-called " group of death " puts three top teams up against each other in a fight to avoid the second elimination spot as it looks inevitable that latvia will claim the first at the end of the group stage .

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .
but now the mortified frustration has been transformed into hopeful anticipation .

entire city districts have been wrapped in orange , newspapers , which generally stick to the traditional black and white , have been injected with a dose of color and streets and even sidewalks have been painted over . besides the vibrant display of support for the boys who have traveled to portugal to defend the soccer honor of a nation , which in non-tournament times fails to generate much passion for the sport , there are gentle jokes aimed at their opponents .
it 's a side sport , a bi-product of the championships , and germany is at it too .
some berliners decided to cover up the name of their street , hollandstrasse , until after the match , and the boulevard press has become more pointed than usual . may the best team win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler germany coach rudi völler has already made it clear that the focus of the match will be on defense , and he is expected to opt for a formation with kevin kuranyi as the only striker .
but even a strong line of defense might not be enough to stave of the determination of the dutch side , which has the greater talent of the two teams .
that said , just as dutch coach dick advocaat 's men have a bit of a reputation for under-achieving at major events , the german team have a miraculous ability to pull it off at the last minute . it 's a well-known fact and a source of contempt for some in the netherlands , who claim the fear they used to feel when their squad was pitched against germany has long since turned into pity .
they pity the lot of a team comprised of anti-soccer artists , players who defend their way to last-minute victory , who have no style on the pitch , and who often just do n't deserve the victories they eek out of their matches . whatever the outcome of this tournament highlight - for 90 minutes tonight tens of millions of feverish fans will shout and cry , hope and pray and watch as the better team plays its way to victory . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thirsty fans drink portugal dry sweden demolished bulgaria 5-0 in the second group c match on monday , as striker henrik larsson sealed his return to the national team with two goals in rapid succession . -lrb- 14 june 2004 -rrb- sweden crushes bulgaria lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland . when germany was drawn to play its debut match of the championships against the netherlands , the news dropped like a stone , but as the big night has drawn closer , the whole nation is abuzz with electrified anticipation .
and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .
but now the mortified frustration has been transformed into hopeful anticipation .
players and fans alike know they can do better , and have no intention of breaking their record of never losing a first round match in a european championship tournament . painting the town orange bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch fans while the germans are marking the big showdown tonight with parties , celebrations and the erection of huge inner-city screens , the dutch are taking their momentary obsession one step further , swamping the little country in the national team 's color : orange .

dw readers responded . i do not see how france can not allow the appeal .
the reason why this procedure is in the court of cassation is precisely because the european court of human rights condemned france for having deprived papon of his fundamental right to appeal his conviction .
it seems to me that the court of cassation will have to hear his appeal , but , since that appeal would succeed only if papon can establish legal flaws in his criminal trial , it seems unlikely that the court would quash his conviction .
bottom line : he would have been accorded the right to appeal his criminal conviction , in accordance with the verdict of the european court of human rights , but , since he was given a full and fair trial , the lower court 's conviction will probably stand . - vivian curran -lrb- professor of law -rrb- the papon case should not be reopened to exonerate him .
instead , he should be sent back to prison , as he is a war criminal .

" there is no arguing about the bitterness of these results , " schröder said .
" but we must pursue our policies because they are objectively necessary . " final results for the european parliament elections showed the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- with 21.5 percent of the vote , its worst postwar performance at a national poll .
the party fared little better in thuringia 's regional elections , taking just 14.5 percent of the vote , its third worst postwar result for a regional ballot . schröder acknowledged he has antagonized large numbers of voters with his unpopular package of welfare and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 . " of course it hurts when the support is n't there , " schröder said on monday before meeting with party leaders to discuss the electoral fiasco .
" but it is my firm conviction that this policy is necessary for our country . " party dissent but not all spd party leaders agree .
the spd 's head in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , has warned his party to cut the speed of reforms .
" when everywhere you look reforms are being pushed through without giving people any perspective on how they 're going to benefit , then they just become fearful , " harald schartau told the german business daily , handelsblatt .
" we ca n't just go on doling out the bitter medicine .
rather , we have to make sure that the remedies are effective . " schartau said it 's now up to the spd to win back its core supporters .
" spd voters are watching very keenly to see if their interests are being represented in the reforms , and if the resulting policies are socially balanced . " industry-heavy nrw has traditionally been a stronghold for the spd , and it 's also where the party is pinning its hopes for a significant turnaround to stop its run of defeats .
nrw will hold regional elections next may .
if the spd were to lose , the conservatives would then have a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , giving them the power to block all government legislation . analysts say such a scenario would usher in a period of political paralysis that would last until germany 's next parliamentary elections in 2006 . regaining trust many commentators in the german media doubt schröder 's ability to hold on to the spd 's voters .
for his part , schröder - who once famously claimed to be the " steady hand " guiding germany through tough times - is hoping that his strategy of staying the course will win him support in the end . the spd 's party chairman , franz müntefering , said the party is not suffering from a communication problem , rather a problem of acceptance .

and the scene in the netherlands is no different .
neither nation makes any secret of the bitter soccer battle which has long raged between the immediate neighbors , and nor do they play down the importance of winning tonight 's match . the odds are on for the netherlands .
not only are they considered the better team , but they have n't lost to germany since 1996 .
so the pressure is mounting for the germans , who had to swallow two embarrassing defeats during pre-tournament matches , when they were thrashed 5:1 by rumania and 2:0 by hungary . neither should have happened , and the german nation was outraged at the ease with which the national squad was led to the slaughter .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- child tooth decay ' rampant ' bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes tuesday , 15 june , 2004 , 04:53 gmt 05:53 uk child tooth decay ' rampant ' thousands of children are having large numbers of their milk teeth removed in hospital at a very early age because they are so badly decayed .
a survey conducted for bbc radio 4 's today programme indicates the problem is worst in scotland , with north-west england and wales also badly affected .
an audit of glasgow dental hospital included a one-year-old. and a four-year-old who had all their teeth out .
dentists blame poor diet - especially sugary drinks in feeding bottles .
public health dentists say the research indicates about 2,000 children aged five or under are having multiple extractions in glasgow alone every year - with an average of between seven and eight teeth removed each time .
some children have to have all 20 milk teeth taken out .
david mccall , a consultant in dental public health in glasgow , said : " it is a large number of children that are needing to have a general anaesthetic to require teeth to be removed for what is a preventable disease . "
another black spot was sheffield , where the local children 's hospital carries out a complete extraction of milk teeth on one child a week , and removes an average of six from 24 others .
rates of decay have been fuelled by an increase in sugars in the diet , and poor dental hygiene .
sticky foods preventing tooth decay clean your teeth at least twice a day to prevent any plaque build up use a toothpaste containing fluoride rinse out the mouth after eating sticky foods have a regular dental check up tooth decay eating a diet rich in sugar and starch increases the risk of tooth decay .
sticky foods can be a particular problem because they are more likely to remain on the surface of the teeth .
frequent snacking also increases the amount of time that acids are in contact with the teeth .
and once the structure of a tooth has been damaged by decay , there is no way to repair it .
the today programme research indicated that cases of multiple extraction of milk teeth are less common in areas where the water supply is fluoridated .
some might argue that the loss of milk teeth is not a serious problem , as they fall out anyway .
however , dentists who are presented with children in severe pain with rotten teeth and infected mouths do not see it that way .
shocking cases hilary whitehead , of east lancashire community dental service , was shocked by two children aged just over two years old who she treated on the same day .
" i think they had been mainly drinking from a bottle , they had not really had a lot of weaning .
" they were tiny , just like babies .
it was really awful .
one had about eight teeth out , and the other had about six .
" they had come to the clinics because they were in pain , they had abscesses on their teeth .
they were really suffering .
" i really feel it is child abuse . "
paul burstow mp , liberal democrat health spokesman , said : " the chronic shortage of dentists taking on new nhs patients means that people are getting out of the habit of going to the dentist and so tooth decay is not being picked up early enough .
" the opportunity for parents and children to be educated about the dangers of tooth decay and the importance of good brushing is also being lost . "
" ministers must urgently tackle the shortage of dentists and listen to dentists ' concerns .
they should be educating parents and children about the dangers of fizzy drinks and the importance of good dental health . "
but professor raman bedi , the government 's chief dental adviser said england was at the top of the european league for child dental health .
however he told bbc radio 4 's today programme , he said : " i think this is a good news story , but we are not complacent .
" we know there is a hard core of children who do need to have extra help . "
he said the key was persuading parents to use fluoride toothpaste for their children and stopping the use of feeding bottles .
who is responsible for the state of children 's teeth ?
send us your comments by using a form below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments . "
come on parents - do your bit ! "
amanda hunter , musselburgh , scotland having two children of my own i definitely feel that the fault lies with parents .
when out and about i regularly see 2-4 year olds with a baby bottle or spouted drinking cup full of sugary juice -lrb- orange , blackcurrant etc -rrb- .
it keeps the child quiet and for some that 's all that counts .
both of my children 3 and 8 brush their teeth twice daily -lrb- finished off by one or other parent -rrb- and attend the dentist every six months .
there will always be the exception to the rule when a child has very soft teeth , however , even this can be controlled with regular dental check ups .
come on parents - do your bit !
amanda hunter , musselburgh , scotland only you as a parent are responsible for what your young child eats or drinks .
surely a pre school child requires your help with teeth cleaning as with dressing and bathing .
imagine the pain these children must have been in .
there is also the uncommon issue that not all children have second teeth .
anita reynolds , zurich switzerland it 's hardly surprising when you look at the poor distribution of nhs dentists .
i have to take my children 25 miles to the nearest dentist who is willing to take on nhs patients .
mr wells , devon i was absolutely appalled after reading your article on the prevalence of tooth decay in -lrb- presumably -rrb- the under 5 's .
a tube of toothpaste costs less than £ 1 , for goodness sakes .
i agree with last comment that was made by a dentist who had just treated two 2 year olds .
i do think that neglecting your child 's teeth , health and general wellbeing is child abuse .
small children have to learn from adults how to take care of themselves , obviously its not happening !
audrey hopkins , glasgow , scotland as the mother of a one-year old , i am shocked to see children on their way to school snacking on crisps and chocolate bars -lrb- and parents often sit right next to their snacking off-spring -rrb- .
what about breakfast at home ?
there is so much that could be done : better school dinners , nutrition and cookery classes for all pupils -lrb- and preferably most parents -rrb- .
alexandra , enfield most dentists are going private in the area and as such will not register children if their parents are not registered mr alex van-minnen , york , yorkshire " you do not have to be a dentist to associate fizzy drinks with tooth decay , just a responsible parent " dave scarlett , heidelberg , germany i have a 4 year old and you could count on one hand , the amount of times she has had a fizzy drink .
she drinks milk , water and juice .
and with the juices , we always look at the sugar content .
my wife and i hardly ever have fizzy drinks either .
you do not have to be a dentist to associate fizzy drinks with tooth decay , just a responsible parent .
dave scarlett , heidelberg , germany parents should exercise more common sense .
what is wrong with putting plain old water in babies ' bottles ?
also , if parents had more control over their children they would n't need to give them sweets to keep them quiet .
my sister and i were only allowed sweets once a week when we visited our grandparents and it was a proper treat !
natalie doncaster , peterborough , uk both lack of education about the damaging effects of sugary drinks in bottles and a lot of parents unwillingness to seek out available education information and advice is once again to blame .
it appears to be easier to give in to children 's desire to have sweets all the time .
my child is 61/2 years old , has not had any teeth extracted and is only just beginning to loose her milk teeth naturally .
this in the end i believe is down to a good diet and encouraging her to brush her teeth every day .
alex , hull good mouth hygiene starts at an early age .
i have two children -lrb- 20 and 16 years of age -rrb- who do not have one filling .
they were n't given too many sweet , fizzy drinks when they were babies and young children .
always brushed their teeth when they were small , and so the habit is always there .
the reason that i did it was i have many fillings and i know the pain that tooth ache can cause and i did n't want them too suffer as i did .
sandra waldron , london the government is to blame .
there is a lack of nhs dentists , due to its poor policy / funding of the service .

a survey conducted for bbc radio 4 's today programme indicates the problem is worst in scotland , with north-west england and wales also badly affected .
an audit of glasgow dental hospital included a one-year-old. and a four-year-old who had all their teeth out .
dentists blame poor diet - especially sugary drinks in feeding bottles .
public health dentists say the research indicates about 2,000 children aged five or under are having multiple extractions in glasgow alone every year - with an average of between seven and eight teeth removed each time .
some children have to have all 20 milk teeth taken out .
david mccall , a consultant in dental public health in glasgow , said : " it is a large number of children that are needing to have a general anaesthetic to require teeth to be removed for what is a preventable disease . "
another black spot was sheffield , where the local children 's hospital carries out a complete extraction of milk teeth on one child a week , and removes an average of six from 24 others .
rates of decay have been fuelled by an increase in sugars in the diet , and poor dental hygiene .
sticky foods preventing tooth decay clean your teeth at least twice a day to prevent any plaque build up use a toothpaste containing fluoride rinse out the mouth after eating sticky foods have a regular dental check up tooth decay eating a diet rich in sugar and starch increases the risk of tooth decay .
sticky foods can be a particular problem because they are more likely to remain on the surface of the teeth .
frequent snacking also increases the amount of time that acids are in contact with the teeth .
and once the structure of a tooth has been damaged by decay , there is no way to repair it .
the today programme research indicated that cases of multiple extraction of milk teeth are less common in areas where the water supply is fluoridated .
some might argue that the loss of milk teeth is not a serious problem , as they fall out anyway .
however , dentists who are presented with children in severe pain with rotten teeth and infected mouths do not see it that way .
shocking cases hilary whitehead , of east lancashire community dental service , was shocked by two children aged just over two years old who she treated on the same day .
" i think they had been mainly drinking from a bottle , they had not really had a lot of weaning .
" they were tiny , just like babies .
it was really awful .
one had about eight teeth out , and the other had about six .
" they had come to the clinics because they were in pain , they had abscesses on their teeth .
they were really suffering .
" i really feel it is child abuse . "
paul burstow mp , liberal democrat health spokesman , said : " the chronic shortage of dentists taking on new nhs patients means that people are getting out of the habit of going to the dentist and so tooth decay is not being picked up early enough .
" the opportunity for parents and children to be educated about the dangers of tooth decay and the importance of good brushing is also being lost . "
" ministers must urgently tackle the shortage of dentists and listen to dentists ' concerns .
they should be educating parents and children about the dangers of fizzy drinks and the importance of good dental health . "
but professor raman bedi , the government 's chief dental adviser said england was at the top of the european league for child dental health .
however he told bbc radio 4 's today programme , he said : " i think this is a good news story , but we are not complacent .
" we know there is a hard core of children who do need to have extra help . "
he said the key was persuading parents to use fluoride toothpaste for their children and stopping the use of feeding bottles .

thank you for your comments .
come on parents - do your bit !
amanda hunter , musselburgh , scotland having two children of my own i definitely feel that the fault lies with parents .
when out and about i regularly see 2-4 year olds with a baby bottle or spouted drinking cup full of sugary juice -lrb- orange , blackcurrant etc -rrb- .
it keeps the child quiet and for some that 's all that counts .
both of my children 3 and 8 brush their teeth twice daily -lrb- finished off by one or other parent -rrb- and attend the dentist every six months .
there will always be the exception to the rule when a child has very soft teeth , however , even this can be controlled with regular dental check ups .
come on parents - do your bit !
amanda hunter , musselburgh , scotland only you as a parent are responsible for what your young child eats or drinks .
surely a pre school child requires your help with teeth cleaning as with dressing and bathing .
imagine the pain these children must have been in .
there is also the uncommon issue that not all children have second teeth .
anita reynolds , zurich switzerland it 's hardly surprising when you look at the poor distribution of nhs dentists .
i have to take my children 25 miles to the nearest dentist who is willing to take on nhs patients .
mr wells , devon i was absolutely appalled after reading your article on the prevalence of tooth decay in -lrb- presumably -rrb- the under 5 's .
a tube of toothpaste costs less than £ 1 , for goodness sakes .
i agree with last comment that was made by a dentist who had just treated two 2 year olds .
i do think that neglecting your child 's teeth , health and general wellbeing is child abuse .
small children have to learn from adults how to take care of themselves , obviously its not happening !
audrey hopkins , glasgow , scotland as the mother of a one-year old , i am shocked to see children on their way to school snacking on crisps and chocolate bars -lrb- and parents often sit right next to their snacking off-spring -rrb- .
what about breakfast at home ?
there is so much that could be done : better school dinners , nutrition and cookery classes for all pupils -lrb- and preferably most parents -rrb- .
alexandra , enfield most dentists are going private in the area and as such will not register children if their parents are not registered mr alex van-minnen , york , yorkshire you do not have to be a dentist to associate fizzy drinks with tooth decay , just a responsible parent dave scarlett , heidelberg , germany i have a 4 year old and you could count on one hand , the amount of times she has had a fizzy drink .
she drinks milk , water and juice .
and with the juices , we always look at the sugar content .
my wife and i hardly ever have fizzy drinks either .
you do not have to be a dentist to associate fizzy drinks with tooth decay , just a responsible parent .
dave scarlett , heidelberg , germany parents should exercise more common sense .
what is wrong with putting plain old water in babies ' bottles ?
also , if parents had more control over their children they would n't need to give them sweets to keep them quiet .
my sister and i were only allowed sweets once a week when we visited our grandparents and it was a proper treat !
natalie doncaster , peterborough , uk both lack of education about the damaging effects of sugary drinks in bottles and a lot of parents unwillingness to seek out available education information and advice is once again to blame .
it appears to be easier to give in to children 's desire to have sweets all the time .
my child is 61/2 years old , has not had any teeth extracted and is only just beginning to loose her milk teeth naturally .
this in the end i believe is down to a good diet and encouraging her to brush her teeth every day .
alex , hull good mouth hygiene starts at an early age .
i have two children -lrb- 20 and 16 years of age -rrb- who do not have one filling .
they were n't given too many sweet , fizzy drinks when they were babies and young children .
always brushed their teeth when they were small , and so the habit is always there .
the reason that i did it was i have many fillings and i know the pain that tooth ache can cause and i did n't want them too suffer as i did .
sandra waldron , london the government is to blame .
there is a lack of nhs dentists , due to its poor policy / funding of the service .
if the parents do not have checkups and advice , what chance do the children have .
steve edwards , gloucester , england parents and carers are to blame for the shocking state of their children 's teeth .
to blame the government , food manufacturers , tv ads , busy lives or anything else is just an attempt to absolve of responsibility those who have actual control over children 's diet .

a survey conducted for bbc radio 4 's today programme indicates the problem is worst in scotland , with north-west england and wales also badly affected .
an audit of glasgow dental hospital included a one-year-old. and a four-year-old who had all their teeth out .
dentists blame poor diet - especially sugary drinks in feeding bottles .
public health dentists say the research indicates about 2,000 children aged five or under are having multiple extractions in glasgow alone every year - with an average of between seven and eight teeth removed each time .
some children have to have all 20 milk teeth taken out .
david mccall , a consultant in dental public health in glasgow , said : " it is a large number of children that are needing to have a general anaesthetic to require teeth to be removed for what is a preventable disease . "
another black spot was sheffield , where the local children 's hospital carries out a complete extraction of milk teeth on one child a week , and removes an average of six from 24 others .
rates of decay have been fuelled by an increase in sugars in the diet , and poor dental hygiene .
sticky foods preventing tooth decay clean your teeth at least twice a day to prevent any plaque build up use a toothpaste containing fluoride rinse out the mouth after eating sticky foods have a regular dental check up tooth decay eating a diet rich in sugar and starch increases the risk of tooth decay .
sticky foods can be a particular problem because they are more likely to remain on the surface of the teeth .
frequent snacking also increases the amount of time that acids are in contact with the teeth .
and once the structure of a tooth has been damaged by decay , there is no way to repair it .
the today programme research indicated that cases of multiple extraction of milk teeth are less common in areas where the water supply is fluoridated .
some might argue that the loss of milk teeth is not a serious problem , as they fall out anyway .
however , dentists who are presented with children in severe pain with rotten teeth and infected mouths do not see it that way .
shocking cases hilary whitehead , of east lancashire community dental service , was shocked by two children aged just over two years old who she treated on the same day .
" i think they had been mainly drinking from a bottle , they had not really had a lot of weaning .
" they were tiny , just like babies .
it was really awful .
one had about eight teeth out , and the other had about six .
" they had come to the clinics because they were in pain , they had abscesses on their teeth .
they were really suffering .
" i really feel it is child abuse . "
paul burstow mp , liberal democrat health spokesman , said : " the chronic shortage of dentists taking on new nhs patients means that people are getting out of the habit of going to the dentist and so tooth decay is not being picked up early enough .
" the opportunity for parents and children to be educated about the dangers of tooth decay and the importance of good brushing is also being lost . "
" ministers must urgently tackle the shortage of dentists and listen to dentists ' concerns .
they should be educating parents and children about the dangers of fizzy drinks and the importance of good dental health . "
but professor raman bedi , the government 's chief dental adviser said england was at the top of the european league for child dental health .
however he told bbc radio 4 's today programme , he said : " i think this is a good news story , but we are not complacent .
" we know there is a hard core of children who do need to have extra help . "
he said the key was persuading parents to use fluoride toothpaste for their children and stopping the use of feeding bottles .

come on parents - do your bit !
amanda hunter , musselburgh , scotland having two children of my own i definitely feel that the fault lies with parents .
when out and about i regularly see 2-4 year olds with a baby bottle or spouted drinking cup full of sugary juice -lrb- orange , blackcurrant etc -rrb- .
it keeps the child quiet and for some that 's all that counts .
both of my children 3 and 8 brush their teeth twice daily -lrb- finished off by one or other parent -rrb- and attend the dentist every six months .
there will always be the exception to the rule when a child has very soft teeth , however , even this can be controlled with regular dental check ups .
come on parents - do your bit !
amanda hunter , musselburgh , scotland only you as a parent are responsible for what your young child eats or drinks .
surely a pre school child requires your help with teeth cleaning as with dressing and bathing .
imagine the pain these children must have been in .
there is also the uncommon issue that not all children have second teeth .
anita reynolds , zurich switzerland it 's hardly surprising when you look at the poor distribution of nhs dentists .
i have to take my children 25 miles to the nearest dentist who is willing to take on nhs patients .
mr wells , devon i was absolutely appalled after reading your article on the prevalence of tooth decay in -lrb- presumably -rrb- the under 5 's .
a tube of toothpaste costs less than £ 1 , for goodness sakes .
i agree with last comment that was made by a dentist who had just treated two 2 year olds .
i do think that neglecting your child 's teeth , health and general wellbeing is child abuse .
small children have to learn from adults how to take care of themselves , obviously its not happening !
audrey hopkins , glasgow , scotland as the mother of a one-year old , i am shocked to see children on their way to school snacking on crisps and chocolate bars -lrb- and parents often sit right next to their snacking off-spring -rrb- .
what about breakfast at home ?
there is so much that could be done : better school dinners , nutrition and cookery classes for all pupils -lrb- and preferably most parents -rrb- .
alexandra , enfield most dentists are going private in the area and as such will not register children if their parents are not registered mr alex van-minnen , york , yorkshire you do not have to be a dentist to associate fizzy drinks with tooth decay , just a responsible parent dave scarlett , heidelberg , germany i have a 4 year old and you could count on one hand , the amount of times she has had a fizzy drink .
she drinks milk , water and juice .
and with the juices , we always look at the sugar content .
my wife and i hardly ever have fizzy drinks either .
you do not have to be a dentist to associate fizzy drinks with tooth decay , just a responsible parent .
dave scarlett , heidelberg , germany parents should exercise more common sense .
what is wrong with putting plain old water in babies ' bottles ?
also , if parents had more control over their children they would n't need to give them sweets to keep them quiet .
my sister and i were only allowed sweets once a week when we visited our grandparents and it was a proper treat !
natalie doncaster , peterborough , uk both lack of education about the damaging effects of sugary drinks in bottles and a lot of parents unwillingness to seek out available education information and advice is once again to blame .
it appears to be easier to give in to children 's desire to have sweets all the time .
my child is 61/2 years old , has not had any teeth extracted and is only just beginning to loose her milk teeth naturally .
this in the end i believe is down to a good diet and encouraging her to brush her teeth every day .
alex , hull good mouth hygiene starts at an early age .
i have two children -lrb- 20 and 16 years of age -rrb- who do not have one filling .
they were n't given too many sweet , fizzy drinks when they were babies and young children .
always brushed their teeth when they were small , and so the habit is always there .
the reason that i did it was i have many fillings and i know the pain that tooth ache can cause and i did n't want them too suffer as i did .
sandra waldron , london the government is to blame .
there is a lack of nhs dentists , due to its poor policy / funding of the service .
if the parents do not have checkups and advice , what chance do the children have .
steve edwards , gloucester , england parents and carers are to blame for the shocking state of their children 's teeth .
to blame the government , food manufacturers , tv ads , busy lives or anything else is just an attempt to absolve of responsibility those who have actual control over children 's diet .
they just ca n't be bothered to make an effort .

the pentagon picked boeing 's proposal to build a modified version of its 737 commercial jet , which offers long term cost savings .
the decision is a blow to lockheed martin , which bid to upgrade its existing sub-hunter p-3 orion planes .
the pentagon said full production could take the deal to $ 20bn later on .
at present , boeing is contracted to build a handful of the planes for testing .
adaptable defence the new long-distance surveillance jets , known multi-mission maritime aircraft -lrb- mma -rrb- , will replace lockheed martin 's turbo-propeller powered p-3s , which have been in use for more than 40 years .
by choosing a proposal based on a widely-used civilian aircraft , the pentagon hopes to save money .
" the 737 has a huge worldwide support base that 's very attractive for a budget conscious navy , " said richard aboulafia , an analyst at teal group , a virginia-based aerospace and defence consultancy .
the new mma jets should be ready for deployment by 2013 , according to john young , us navy assistant secretary for research , development and acquisition .
the 737 planes will be equipped with hi-tech military surveillance equipment .

anne owers said the number of inmates was stopping brixton prison reaching its full potential .
the prison , branded institutionally racist in 2000 , was commended for improving prisoner and staff relations and arrangements for new prisoners .
but an inspection report said some basic needs , such as pillows , privacy and cleanliness , were not being met .
and it found while senior managers and many staff were trying to make improvements , they needed more support to get results .
ms owers described the prison as " an overcrowded , under resourced local prison with too many prisoners held only for short periods " .
there should be a project team to manage the major change programme to ensure the new developments are firmly bedded in anne owers , chief inspector of prisons there were not enough spaces on activity programmes for the 798 prisoners , the inspection found .
while inmates were allowed out of cells once a day , timings varied so they could spend 24 hours in cells at a time , although measures have since been taken to address this .
ms owers also said " response to cell call bells , which could signal an emergency , was unacceptably lax " , and " the kitchen was a health and safety risk " .
but the inspection in february found staff and prisoner relationships were generally relaxed and most prisoners said they were treated with respect .
ms owers said the prison suffers from a " cramped and elderly site " and to fulfil its potential it needs a smaller and more stable population .
