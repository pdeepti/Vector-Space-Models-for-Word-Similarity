investigators seized the shipment before it reached its destination . just a few months before libya declared it would cease its efforts to create weapons of mass destruction , american and british agents seized a german freighter ship loaded with centrifuges and other parts that are used to create enriched uranium , the material needed to build nuclear bombs .
the seizure is believed to have influenced tripoli ’ s decision to suspend its weapons program last month .
on wednesday , u.s. state department spokesman adam areli confirmed the discovery following a report in the wall street journal , a financial daily , that the german ship had been en route to libya but was diverted to an italian port so that u.s. investigators could seize the content .
the newspaper cited officials saying the german company which owns the ship , hamburg-based bbc chartering and logistic , had been extremely cooperative with investigators after they were alerted to intelligence that the ship might be carrying the parts .
" a ship was diverted , based on intelligence , that it was carrying centrifuge parts in early october , " areli said , adding that the seizure demonstrated the value of the u.s. ’
proliferation security initiative , which aims to prevent the production of weapons of mass destruction .
sixteen countries , including germany , are participating in the global initiative .
thousands of components seized u.s. and british intelligence agents had learned the ship would be leaving a persian gulf state with the parts and an ultimate destination of libya .
german authorities were informed and contact was made with the german shipping company .
a u.s. navy ship then escorted the " bbc china " to port .
investigators found several thousand components on the ship that are used to enrich uranium .
washington officials said wednesday they believed the discovery might have helped sway libya towards agreeing to stop its weapons program and open its doors for international inspections .
following months of secret negotiations with tripoli , the u.s. and britain announced on dec .
19 that libyan leader moammar gadhafi had agreed to a deal on inspections .
after the seizures , an unnamed u.s. government official told the paper , tripoli " saw how much we knew about what they were doing . "
with the investigation continuing , u.s. officials have refused to state who sold the centrifuges or where they originated from . dw staff with wire services -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a model for successful pressure against rogue nations ?
libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp .

on jan .
1 , ireland takes over the european union ’ s most-important office for six months .
but unlike its italian predecessor , dublin is steering clear of great expectations . rue archimede is a side street located near the council of ministers in brussels .
there are a number of irish pubs here .
at the james joyce , barkeeper pat says he thinks europe ’ s problems can be solved more easily over a bitter dark beer .
bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , the emerald island ’ s prime minister , takes a less casual view .
he ’ s just inherited the job of playing the middle man and chief negotiator in the recently collapsed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern talks over an eu constitution .
the european summit broke down in december over disputes on how votes should be weighed and now ahern has to try to pick up the scraps .
the debate pitted germany and france against poland and spain , who rejected the constitution ’ s call for double-majority voting , which would have required a majority of member states to approve important decisions and for those votes to represent a majority of the eu population .
the system would have created an advantage for larger member states like germany .
ireland sees itself as the mediator in the dispute because ahern has said he could live with the voting system - either as seen in the current constitutional draft or the complicated deal reached in nice or any other sensible compromise that can be reached .
drawn out battle expected but most observers in brussels say that the negotiations will likely continue through the end of 2004 .
for his part , ahern is pleading for other member states to preserve the parts of the draft constitution where they have found unity .
but other countries have said everything should be open to negotiation .
ireland has also rejected a proposal by germany and france to create a two-tier system that would allow any countries who are serious about deeper european integration to do so at an accelerated pace .
the irish presidency also faces what is likely to turn into a major allocations battle in the eu .

during the same period , 10 new members will also be joining the eu from eastern and southeastern europe and cyprus .
but that ’ s a development irish foreign minister brian cowen observes positively .
" we want to make sure that the remaining problems are taken care of so that -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion can be executed seamlessly , " cowen said .
in terms of policy , ireland says it wants to promote economic programs in order to fulfill the eu ’ s ambitious goal of becoming the most-innovative region in the world .
compared to the united states , europe has a great social system , ireland ’ s ahern says , but when it comes to research and development and education , europe falls behind it .
but foreign minister cowen believes the real measuring stick for the presidency will be " progress . "
he believes " competitive ability , growth and jobs are , correctly , the questions against which our citizens will judge the success of the european project . "
‘ it ’ s the economy , stupid ! ’
ireland itself has profited considerably since it joined the eu in 1973 .
with the aid of subsidies from brussels , the country was able to regenerate its economy , reduce unemployment and attract foreign investors .
some even started to call it the " celtic tiger . "
meanwhile , the eu has also benefited from ireland 's membership .
the country has gone from being among the poorest in the eu to become a prosperous land that is an eu net payer .
as a strictly neutral country , ireland is not a member of the nato military alliance does not count among the group of european countries calling for a common defense policy .
perhaps wisely considering the political strife that marred the italian presidency , ireland is taking a modest approach to its term at the eu ’ s helm .

bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , the emerald island ’ s prime minister , takes a less casual view .
he ’ s just inherited the job of playing the middle man and chief negotiator in the recently collapsed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern talks over an eu constitution .
the european summit broke down in december over disputes on how votes should be weighed and now ahern has to try to pick up the scraps .
the debate pitted germany and france against poland and spain , who rejected the constitution ’ s call for double-majority voting , which would have required a majority of member states to approve important decisions and for those votes to represent a majority of the eu population .
the system would have created an advantage for larger member states like germany .
ireland sees itself as the mediator in the dispute because ahern has said he could live with the voting system - either as seen in the current constitutional draft or the complicated deal reached in nice or any other sensible compromise that can be reached .
drawn out battle expected but most observers in brussels say that the negotiations will likely continue through the end of 2004 .
for his part , ahern is pleading for other member states to preserve the parts of the draft constitution where they have found unity .
but other countries have said everything should be open to negotiation .
ireland has also rejected a proposal by germany and france to create a two-tier system that would allow any countries who are serious about deeper european integration to do so at an accelerated pace .

in terms of policy , ireland says it wants to promote economic programs in order to fulfill the eu ’ s ambitious goal of becoming the most-innovative region in the world .
compared to the united states , europe has a great social system , ireland ’ s ahern says , but when it comes to research and development and education , europe falls behind it .

ireland itself has profited considerably since it joined the eu in 1973 .
with the aid of subsidies from brussels , the country was able to regenerate its economy , reduce unemployment and attract foreign investors .

meanwhile , the eu has also benefited from ireland 's membership .
the country has gone from being among the poorest in the eu to become a prosperous land that is an eu net payer .
as a strictly neutral country , ireland is not a member of the nato military alliance does not count among the group of european countries calling for a common defense policy .

investigators seized the shipment before it reached its destination . just a few months before libya declared it would cease its efforts to create weapons of mass destruction , american and british agents seized a german freighter ship loaded with centrifuges and other parts that are used to create enriched uranium , the material needed to build nuclear bombs .

german authorities were informed and contact was made with the german shipping company .

investigators found several thousand components on the ship that are used to enrich uranium .

investigators seized the shipment before it reached its destination . just a few months before libya declared it would cease its efforts to create weapons of mass destruction , american and british agents seized a german freighter ship loaded with centrifuges and other parts that are used to create enriched uranium , the material needed to build nuclear bombs .

on jan .
1 , ireland takes over the european union ’ s most-important office for six months .
but unlike its italian predecessor , dublin is steering clear of great expectations . rue archimede is a side street located near the council of ministers in brussels .
there are a number of irish pubs here .
at the james joyce , barkeeper pat says he thinks europe ’ s problems can be solved more easily over a bitter dark beer .
bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , the emerald island ’ s prime minister , takes a less casual view .
he ’ s just inherited the job of playing the middle man and chief negotiator in the recently collapsed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern talks over an eu constitution .
the european summit broke down in december over disputes on how votes should be weighed and now ahern has to try to pick up the scraps .
the debate pitted germany and france against poland and spain , who rejected the constitution ’ s call for double-majority voting , which would have required a majority of member states to approve important decisions and for those votes to represent a majority of the eu population .
the system would have created an advantage for larger member states like germany .
ireland sees itself as the mediator in the dispute because ahern has said he could live with the voting system - either as seen in the current constitutional draft or the complicated deal reached in nice or any other sensible compromise that can be reached .
drawn out battle expected but most observers in brussels say that the negotiations will likely continue through the end of 2004 .
for his part , ahern is pleading for other member states to preserve the parts of the draft constitution where they have found unity .
but other countries have said everything should be open to negotiation .
ireland has also rejected a proposal by germany and france to create a two-tier system that would allow any countries who are serious about deeper european integration to do so at an accelerated pace .
the irish presidency also faces what is likely to turn into a major allocations battle in the eu .
during the first part of the year , the european commission will be presenting its spending plan for 2007 and beyond .
six of the eu ’ s so-called net payers , the countries that pay more money into the eu ’ s coffers than they get back , including germany , have said they want to freeze current expenditures .
expansion and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president rolandas paksas speaks during a formal sitting of the plenary session of the european parliament in brussels , wednesday nov .
5 , 2003 .
the european parliament on wednesday will discuss a report on the ten countries set to join the eu next spring .
lithuania is among the ten joining members .
-lrb- ap photo / virginia mayo -rrb- in spring , important decisions also need to be made about eu personnel .
romano prodi ’ s term as european commission president ends in nov .
2004 and a replacement must be found soon .
during the same period , 10 new members will also be joining the eu from eastern and southeastern europe and cyprus .
but that ’ s a development irish foreign minister brian cowen observes positively .
" we want to make sure that the remaining problems are taken care of so that -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion can be executed seamlessly , " cowen said .
in terms of policy , ireland says it wants to promote economic programs in order to fulfill the eu ’ s ambitious goal of becoming the most-innovative region in the world .
compared to the united states , europe has a great social system , ireland ’ s ahern says , but when it comes to research and development and education , europe falls behind it .
but foreign minister cowen believes the real measuring stick for the presidency will be " progress . "
he believes " competitive ability , growth and jobs are , correctly , the questions against which our citizens will judge the success of the european project . "
‘ it ’ s the economy , stupid ! ’
ireland itself has profited considerably since it joined the eu in 1973 .
with the aid of subsidies from brussels , the country was able to regenerate its economy , reduce unemployment and attract foreign investors .
some even started to call it the " celtic tiger . "
meanwhile , the eu has also benefited from ireland 's membership .
the country has gone from being among the poorest in the eu to become a prosperous land that is an eu net payer .
as a strictly neutral country , ireland is not a member of the nato military alliance does not count among the group of european countries calling for a common defense policy .
perhaps wisely considering the political strife that marred the italian presidency , ireland is taking a modest approach to its term at the eu ’ s helm .
cowen has sought to avoid developing major expectations for what ireland ’ s presidency can deliver .
but he is certain about one thing : what ever ireland does do , " it will do so with a smile .

on jan .
1 , ireland takes over the european union ’ s most-important office for six months .
but unlike its italian predecessor , dublin is steering clear of great expectations . rue archimede is a side street located near the council of ministers in brussels .
there are a number of irish pubs here .
at the james joyce , barkeeper pat says he thinks europe ’ s problems can be solved more easily over a bitter dark beer .
bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , the emerald island ’ s prime minister , takes a less casual view .
he ’ s just inherited the job of playing the middle man and chief negotiator in the recently collapsed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern talks over an eu constitution .
the european summit broke down in december over disputes on how votes should be weighed and now ahern has to try to pick up the scraps .
the debate pitted germany and france against poland and spain , who rejected the constitution ’ s call for double-majority voting , which would have required a majority of member states to approve important decisions and for those votes to represent a majority of the eu population .
the system would have created an advantage for larger member states like germany .
ireland sees itself as the mediator in the dispute because ahern has said he could live with the voting system - either as seen in the current constitutional draft or the complicated deal reached in nice or any other sensible compromise that can be reached .
drawn out battle expected but most observers in brussels say that the negotiations will likely continue through the end of 2004 .
for his part , ahern is pleading for other member states to preserve the parts of the draft constitution where they have found unity .
but other countries have said everything should be open to negotiation .
ireland has also rejected a proposal by germany and france to create a two-tier system that would allow any countries who are serious about deeper european integration to do so at an accelerated pace .
the irish presidency also faces what is likely to turn into a major allocations battle in the eu .
during the first part of the year , the european commission will be presenting its spending plan for 2007 and beyond .
six of the eu ’ s so-called net payers , the countries that pay more money into the eu ’ s coffers than they get back , including germany , have said they want to freeze current expenditures .

investigators seized the shipment before it reached its destination . just a few months before libya declared it would cease its efforts to create weapons of mass destruction , american and british agents seized a german freighter ship loaded with centrifuges and other parts that are used to create enriched uranium , the material needed to build nuclear bombs .
the seizure is believed to have influenced tripoli ’ s decision to suspend its weapons program last month .
on wednesday , u.s. state department spokesman adam areli confirmed the discovery following a report in the wall street journal , a financial daily , that the german ship had been en route to libya but was diverted to an italian port so that u.s. investigators could seize the content .
the newspaper cited officials saying the german company which owns the ship , hamburg-based bbc chartering and logistic , had been extremely cooperative with investigators after they were alerted to intelligence that the ship might be carrying the parts .
" a ship was diverted , based on intelligence , that it was carrying centrifuge parts in early october , " areli said , adding that the seizure demonstrated the value of the u.s. ’

sixteen countries , including germany , are participating in the global initiative .

german authorities were informed and contact was made with the german shipping company .

investigators found several thousand components on the ship that are used to enrich uranium .

on jan .
1 , ireland takes over the european union ’ s most-important office for six months .
but unlike its italian predecessor , dublin is steering clear of great expectations . rue archimede is a side street located near the council of ministers in brussels .
there are a number of irish pubs here .
at the james joyce , barkeeper pat says he thinks europe ’ s problems can be solved more easily over a bitter dark beer .
bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , the emerald island ’ s prime minister , takes a less casual view .
he ’ s just inherited the job of playing the middle man and chief negotiator in the recently collapsed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern talks over an eu constitution .
the european summit broke down in december over disputes on how votes should be weighed and now ahern has to try to pick up the scraps .
the debate pitted germany and france against poland and spain , who rejected the constitution ’ s call for double-majority voting , which would have required a majority of member states to approve important decisions and for those votes to represent a majority of the eu population .
the system would have created an advantage for larger member states like germany .
ireland sees itself as the mediator in the dispute because ahern has said he could live with the voting system - either as seen in the current constitutional draft or the complicated deal reached in nice or any other sensible compromise that can be reached .
drawn out battle expected but most observers in brussels say that the negotiations will likely continue through the end of 2004 .
for his part , ahern is pleading for other member states to preserve the parts of the draft constitution where they have found unity .
but other countries have said everything should be open to negotiation .
ireland has also rejected a proposal by germany and france to create a two-tier system that would allow any countries who are serious about deeper european integration to do so at an accelerated pace .
the irish presidency also faces what is likely to turn into a major allocations battle in the eu .
during the first part of the year , the european commission will be presenting its spending plan for 2007 and beyond .
six of the eu ’ s so-called net payers , the countries that pay more money into the eu ’ s coffers than they get back , including germany , have said they want to freeze current expenditures .

romano prodi ’ s term as european commission president ends in nov .
2004 and a replacement must be found soon .
during the same period , 10 new members will also be joining the eu from eastern and southeastern europe and cyprus .
but that ’ s a development irish foreign minister brian cowen observes positively .
" we want to make sure that the remaining problems are taken care of so that -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion can be executed seamlessly , " cowen said .
in terms of policy , ireland says it wants to promote economic programs in order to fulfill the eu ’ s ambitious goal of becoming the most-innovative region in the world .
compared to the united states , europe has a great social system , ireland ’ s ahern says , but when it comes to research and development and education , europe falls behind it .
but foreign minister cowen believes the real measuring stick for the presidency will be " progress . "
he believes " competitive ability , growth and jobs are , correctly , the questions against which our citizens will judge the success of the european project . "
‘ it ’ s the economy , stupid ! ’
ireland itself has profited considerably since it joined the eu in 1973 .
with the aid of subsidies from brussels , the country was able to regenerate its economy , reduce unemployment and attract foreign investors .
some even started to call it the " celtic tiger . "
meanwhile , the eu has also benefited from ireland 's membership .
the country has gone from being among the poorest in the eu to become a prosperous land that is an eu net payer .
as a strictly neutral country , ireland is not a member of the nato military alliance does not count among the group of european countries calling for a common defense policy .
perhaps wisely considering the political strife that marred the italian presidency , ireland is taking a modest approach to its term at the eu ’ s helm .
cowen has sought to avoid developing major expectations for what ireland ’ s presidency can deliver .

investigators seized the shipment before it reached its destination . just a few months before libya declared it would cease its efforts to create weapons of mass destruction , american and british agents seized a german freighter ship loaded with centrifuges and other parts that are used to create enriched uranium , the material needed to build nuclear bombs .
the seizure is believed to have influenced tripoli ’ s decision to suspend its weapons program last month .
on wednesday , u.s. state department spokesman adam areli confirmed the discovery following a report in the wall street journal , a financial daily , that the german ship had been en route to libya but was diverted to an italian port so that u.s. investigators could seize the content .
the newspaper cited officials saying the german company which owns the ship , hamburg-based bbc chartering and logistic , had been extremely cooperative with investigators after they were alerted to intelligence that the ship might be carrying the parts .
" a ship was diverted , based on intelligence , that it was carrying centrifuge parts in early october , " areli said , adding that the seizure demonstrated the value of the u.s. ’

on jan .
1 , ireland takes over the european union ’ s most-important office for six months .
but unlike its italian predecessor , dublin is steering clear of great expectations . rue archimede is a side street located near the council of ministers in brussels .
there are a number of irish pubs here .
at the james joyce , barkeeper pat says he thinks europe ’ s problems can be solved more easily over a bitter dark beer .
bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , the emerald island ’ s prime minister , takes a less casual view .
he ’ s just inherited the job of playing the middle man and chief negotiator in the recently collapsed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern talks over an eu constitution .
the european summit broke down in december over disputes on how votes should be weighed and now ahern has to try to pick up the scraps .
the debate pitted germany and france against poland and spain , who rejected the constitution ’ s call for double-majority voting , which would have required a majority of member states to approve important decisions and for those votes to represent a majority of the eu population .
the system would have created an advantage for larger member states like germany .
ireland sees itself as the mediator in the dispute because ahern has said he could live with the voting system - either as seen in the current constitutional draft or the complicated deal reached in nice or any other sensible compromise that can be reached .
drawn out battle expected but most observers in brussels say that the negotiations will likely continue through the end of 2004 .
for his part , ahern is pleading for other member states to preserve the parts of the draft constitution where they have found unity .
but other countries have said everything should be open to negotiation .
ireland has also rejected a proposal by germany and france to create a two-tier system that would allow any countries who are serious about deeper european integration to do so at an accelerated pace .
the irish presidency also faces what is likely to turn into a major allocations battle in the eu .
during the first part of the year , the european commission will be presenting its spending plan for 2007 and beyond .
six of the eu ’ s so-called net payers , the countries that pay more money into the eu ’ s coffers than they get back , including germany , have said they want to freeze current expenditures .

the european parliament on wednesday will discuss a report on the ten countries set to join the eu next spring .
lithuania is among the ten joining members .

romano prodi ’ s term as european commission president ends in nov .
2004 and a replacement must be found soon .
during the same period , 10 new members will also be joining the eu from eastern and southeastern europe and cyprus .
but that ’ s a development irish foreign minister brian cowen observes positively .
" we want to make sure that the remaining problems are taken care of so that -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion can be executed seamlessly , " cowen said .
in terms of policy , ireland says it wants to promote economic programs in order to fulfill the eu ’ s ambitious goal of becoming the most-innovative region in the world .
compared to the united states , europe has a great social system , ireland ’ s ahern says , but when it comes to research and development and education , europe falls behind it .
but foreign minister cowen believes the real measuring stick for the presidency will be " progress . "
he believes " competitive ability , growth and jobs are , correctly , the questions against which our citizens will judge the success of the european project . "
‘ it ’ s the economy , stupid ! ’
ireland itself has profited considerably since it joined the eu in 1973 .
with the aid of subsidies from brussels , the country was able to regenerate its economy , reduce unemployment and attract foreign investors .
some even started to call it the " celtic tiger . "
meanwhile , the eu has also benefited from ireland 's membership .
the country has gone from being among the poorest in the eu to become a prosperous land that is an eu net payer .
as a strictly neutral country , ireland is not a member of the nato military alliance does not count among the group of european countries calling for a common defense policy .
perhaps wisely considering the political strife that marred the italian presidency , ireland is taking a modest approach to its term at the eu ’ s helm .
cowen has sought to avoid developing major expectations for what ireland ’ s presidency can deliver .
but he is certain about one thing : what ever ireland does do , " it will do so with a smile .

on jan .
1 , ireland takes over the european union ’ s most-important office for six months .
but unlike its italian predecessor , dublin is steering clear of great expectations . rue archimede is a side street located near the council of ministers in brussels .
there are a number of irish pubs here .
at the james joyce , barkeeper pat says he thinks europe ’ s problems can be solved more easily over a bitter dark beer .
bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , the emerald island ’ s prime minister , takes a less casual view .
he ’ s just inherited the job of playing the middle man and chief negotiator in the recently collapsed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern talks over an eu constitution .
the european summit broke down in december over disputes on how votes should be weighed and now ahern has to try to pick up the scraps .
the debate pitted germany and france against poland and spain , who rejected the constitution ’ s call for double-majority voting , which would have required a majority of member states to approve important decisions and for those votes to represent a majority of the eu population .
the system would have created an advantage for larger member states like germany .
ireland sees itself as the mediator in the dispute because ahern has said he could live with the voting system - either as seen in the current constitutional draft or the complicated deal reached in nice or any other sensible compromise that can be reached .
drawn out battle expected but most observers in brussels say that the negotiations will likely continue through the end of 2004 .
for his part , ahern is pleading for other member states to preserve the parts of the draft constitution where they have found unity .
but other countries have said everything should be open to negotiation .
ireland has also rejected a proposal by germany and france to create a two-tier system that would allow any countries who are serious about deeper european integration to do so at an accelerated pace .

investigators seized the shipment before it reached its destination . just a few months before libya declared it would cease its efforts to create weapons of mass destruction , american and british agents seized a german freighter ship loaded with centrifuges and other parts that are used to create enriched uranium , the material needed to build nuclear bombs .
the seizure is believed to have influenced tripoli ’ s decision to suspend its weapons program last month .
on wednesday , u.s. state department spokesman adam areli confirmed the discovery following a report in the wall street journal , a financial daily , that the german ship had been en route to libya but was diverted to an italian port so that u.s. investigators could seize the content .
the newspaper cited officials saying the german company which owns the ship , hamburg-based bbc chartering and logistic , had been extremely cooperative with investigators after they were alerted to intelligence that the ship might be carrying the parts .
" a ship was diverted , based on intelligence , that it was carrying centrifuge parts in early october , " areli said , adding that the seizure demonstrated the value of the u.s. ’
proliferation security initiative , which aims to prevent the production of weapons of mass destruction .
sixteen countries , including germany , are participating in the global initiative .
thousands of components seized u.s. and british intelligence agents had learned the ship would be leaving a persian gulf state with the parts and an ultimate destination of libya .
german authorities were informed and contact was made with the german shipping company .
a u.s. navy ship then escorted the " bbc china " to port .
investigators found several thousand components on the ship that are used to enrich uranium .
washington officials said wednesday they believed the discovery might have helped sway libya towards agreeing to stop its weapons program and open its doors for international inspections .
following months of secret negotiations with tripoli , the u.s. and britain announced on dec .
19 that libyan leader moammar gadhafi had agreed to a deal on inspections .
after the seizures , an unnamed u.s. government official told the paper , tripoli " saw how much we knew about what they were doing . "
with the investigation continuing , u.s. officials have refused to state who sold the centrifuges or where they originated from . dw staff with wire services -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a model for successful pressure against rogue nations ?

on jan .
1 , ireland takes over the european union ’ s most-important office for six months .
but unlike its italian predecessor , dublin is steering clear of great expectations . rue archimede is a side street located near the council of ministers in brussels .
there are a number of irish pubs here .
at the james joyce , barkeeper pat says he thinks europe ’ s problems can be solved more easily over a bitter dark beer .
bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , the emerald island ’ s prime minister , takes a less casual view .
he ’ s just inherited the job of playing the middle man and chief negotiator in the recently collapsed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern talks over an eu constitution .
the european summit broke down in december over disputes on how votes should be weighed and now ahern has to try to pick up the scraps .
the debate pitted germany and france against poland and spain , who rejected the constitution ’ s call for double-majority voting , which would have required a majority of member states to approve important decisions and for those votes to represent a majority of the eu population .
the system would have created an advantage for larger member states like germany .
ireland sees itself as the mediator in the dispute because ahern has said he could live with the voting system - either as seen in the current constitutional draft or the complicated deal reached in nice or any other sensible compromise that can be reached .
drawn out battle expected but most observers in brussels say that the negotiations will likely continue through the end of 2004 .
for his part , ahern is pleading for other member states to preserve the parts of the draft constitution where they have found unity .
but other countries have said everything should be open to negotiation .
ireland has also rejected a proposal by germany and france to create a two-tier system that would allow any countries who are serious about deeper european integration to do so at an accelerated pace .
the irish presidency also faces what is likely to turn into a major allocations battle in the eu .
during the first part of the year , the european commission will be presenting its spending plan for 2007 and beyond .
six of the eu ’ s so-called net payers , the countries that pay more money into the eu ’ s coffers than they get back , including germany , have said they want to freeze current expenditures .

5 , 2003 .
the european parliament on wednesday will discuss a report on the ten countries set to join the eu next spring .
lithuania is among the ten joining members .
-lrb- ap photo / virginia mayo -rrb- in spring , important decisions also need to be made about eu personnel .
romano prodi ’ s term as european commission president ends in nov .
2004 and a replacement must be found soon .
during the same period , 10 new members will also be joining the eu from eastern and southeastern europe and cyprus .
but that ’ s a development irish foreign minister brian cowen observes positively .
" we want to make sure that the remaining problems are taken care of so that -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion can be executed seamlessly , " cowen said .
in terms of policy , ireland says it wants to promote economic programs in order to fulfill the eu ’ s ambitious goal of becoming the most-innovative region in the world .
compared to the united states , europe has a great social system , ireland ’ s ahern says , but when it comes to research and development and education , europe falls behind it .
but foreign minister cowen believes the real measuring stick for the presidency will be " progress . "
he believes " competitive ability , growth and jobs are , correctly , the questions against which our citizens will judge the success of the european project . "
‘ it ’ s the economy , stupid ! ’
ireland itself has profited considerably since it joined the eu in 1973 .
with the aid of subsidies from brussels , the country was able to regenerate its economy , reduce unemployment and attract foreign investors .
some even started to call it the " celtic tiger . "
meanwhile , the eu has also benefited from ireland 's membership .
the country has gone from being among the poorest in the eu to become a prosperous land that is an eu net payer .
as a strictly neutral country , ireland is not a member of the nato military alliance does not count among the group of european countries calling for a common defense policy .
perhaps wisely considering the political strife that marred the italian presidency , ireland is taking a modest approach to its term at the eu ’ s helm .
cowen has sought to avoid developing major expectations for what ireland ’ s presidency can deliver .
but he is certain about one thing : what ever ireland does do , " it will do so with a smile .

investigators seized the shipment before it reached its destination . just a few months before libya declared it would cease its efforts to create weapons of mass destruction , american and british agents seized a german freighter ship loaded with centrifuges and other parts that are used to create enriched uranium , the material needed to build nuclear bombs .
the seizure is believed to have influenced tripoli ’ s decision to suspend its weapons program last month .
on wednesday , u.s. state department spokesman adam areli confirmed the discovery following a report in the wall street journal , a financial daily , that the german ship had been en route to libya but was diverted to an italian port so that u.s. investigators could seize the content .
the newspaper cited officials saying the german company which owns the ship , hamburg-based bbc chartering and logistic , had been extremely cooperative with investigators after they were alerted to intelligence that the ship might be carrying the parts .
" a ship was diverted , based on intelligence , that it was carrying centrifuge parts in early october , " areli said , adding that the seizure demonstrated the value of the u.s. ’
proliferation security initiative , which aims to prevent the production of weapons of mass destruction .
sixteen countries , including germany , are participating in the global initiative .
thousands of components seized u.s. and british intelligence agents had learned the ship would be leaving a persian gulf state with the parts and an ultimate destination of libya .
german authorities were informed and contact was made with the german shipping company .
a u.s. navy ship then escorted the " bbc china " to port .
investigators found several thousand components on the ship that are used to enrich uranium .
washington officials said wednesday they believed the discovery might have helped sway libya towards agreeing to stop its weapons program and open its doors for international inspections .
following months of secret negotiations with tripoli , the u.s. and britain announced on dec .
19 that libyan leader moammar gadhafi had agreed to a deal on inspections .
after the seizures , an unnamed u.s. government official told the paper , tripoli " saw how much we knew about what they were doing . "
with the investigation continuing , u.s. officials have refused to state who sold the centrifuges or where they originated from . dw staff with wire services -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a model for successful pressure against rogue nations ?
libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.01.2004 ireland takes helm of eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for six months , dublin will become the political center of europe .
on jan .
1 , ireland takes over the european union ’ s most-important office for six months .
but unlike its italian predecessor , dublin is steering clear of great expectations . rue archimede is a side street located near the council of ministers in brussels .
there are a number of irish pubs here .
at the james joyce , barkeeper pat says he thinks europe ’ s problems can be solved more easily over a bitter dark beer .
bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , the emerald island ’ s prime minister , takes a less casual view .
he ’ s just inherited the job of playing the middle man and chief negotiator in the recently collapsed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern talks over an eu constitution .
the european summit broke down in december over disputes on how votes should be weighed and now ahern has to try to pick up the scraps .
the debate pitted germany and france against poland and spain , who rejected the constitution ’ s call for double-majority voting , which would have required a majority of member states to approve important decisions and for those votes to represent a majority of the eu population .
the system would have created an advantage for larger member states like germany .
ireland sees itself as the mediator in the dispute because ahern has said he could live with the voting system - either as seen in the current constitutional draft or the complicated deal reached in nice or any other sensible compromise that can be reached .
drawn out battle expected but most observers in brussels say that the negotiations will likely continue through the end of 2004 .
for his part , ahern is pleading for other member states to preserve the parts of the draft constitution where they have found unity .
but other countries have said everything should be open to negotiation .
ireland has also rejected a proposal by germany and france to create a two-tier system that would allow any countries who are serious about deeper european integration to do so at an accelerated pace .
the irish presidency also faces what is likely to turn into a major allocations battle in the eu .
during the first part of the year , the european commission will be presenting its spending plan for 2007 and beyond .
six of the eu ’ s so-called net payers , the countries that pay more money into the eu ’ s coffers than they get back , including germany , have said they want to freeze current expenditures .
expansion and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president rolandas paksas speaks during a formal sitting of the plenary session of the european parliament in brussels , wednesday nov .
5 , 2003 .
the european parliament on wednesday will discuss a report on the ten countries set to join the eu next spring .
lithuania is among the ten joining members .
-lrb- ap photo / virginia mayo -rrb- in spring , important decisions also need to be made about eu personnel .
romano prodi ’ s term as european commission president ends in nov .
2004 and a replacement must be found soon .
during the same period , 10 new members will also be joining the eu from eastern and southeastern europe and cyprus .
but that ’ s a development irish foreign minister brian cowen observes positively .
" we want to make sure that the remaining problems are taken care of so that -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion can be executed seamlessly , " cowen said .
in terms of policy , ireland says it wants to promote economic programs in order to fulfill the eu ’ s ambitious goal of becoming the most-innovative region in the world .
compared to the united states , europe has a great social system , ireland ’ s ahern says , but when it comes to research and development and education , europe falls behind it .
but foreign minister cowen believes the real measuring stick for the presidency will be " progress . "
he believes " competitive ability , growth and jobs are , correctly , the questions against which our citizens will judge the success of the european project . "
‘ it ’ s the economy , stupid ! ’
ireland itself has profited considerably since it joined the eu in 1973 .
with the aid of subsidies from brussels , the country was able to regenerate its economy , reduce unemployment and attract foreign investors .
some even started to call it the " celtic tiger . "
meanwhile , the eu has also benefited from ireland 's membership .
the country has gone from being among the poorest in the eu to become a prosperous land that is an eu net payer .
as a strictly neutral country , ireland is not a member of the nato military alliance does not count among the group of european countries calling for a common defense policy .
perhaps wisely considering the political strife that marred the italian presidency , ireland is taking a modest approach to its term at the eu ’ s helm .
cowen has sought to avoid developing major expectations for what ireland ’ s presidency can deliver .
but he is certain about one thing : what ever ireland does do , " it will do so with a smile .

on jan .
1 , ireland takes over the european union ’ s most-important office for six months .
but unlike its italian predecessor , dublin is steering clear of great expectations . rue archimede is a side street located near the council of ministers in brussels .
there are a number of irish pubs here .
at the james joyce , barkeeper pat says he thinks europe ’ s problems can be solved more easily over a bitter dark beer .
bertie ahern -lrb- photo -rrb- , the emerald island ’ s prime minister , takes a less casual view .
he ’ s just inherited the job of playing the middle man and chief negotiator in the recently collapsed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertie ahern talks over an eu constitution .
the european summit broke down in december over disputes on how votes should be weighed and now ahern has to try to pick up the scraps .
the debate pitted germany and france against poland and spain , who rejected the constitution ’ s call for double-majority voting , which would have required a majority of member states to approve important decisions and for those votes to represent a majority of the eu population .
the system would have created an advantage for larger member states like germany .
ireland sees itself as the mediator in the dispute because ahern has said he could live with the voting system - either as seen in the current constitutional draft or the complicated deal reached in nice or any other sensible compromise that can be reached .
drawn out battle expected but most observers in brussels say that the negotiations will likely continue through the end of 2004 .
for his part , ahern is pleading for other member states to preserve the parts of the draft constitution where they have found unity .
but other countries have said everything should be open to negotiation .
ireland has also rejected a proposal by germany and france to create a two-tier system that would allow any countries who are serious about deeper european integration to do so at an accelerated pace .
the irish presidency also faces what is likely to turn into a major allocations battle in the eu .
during the first part of the year , the european commission will be presenting its spending plan for 2007 and beyond .
six of the eu ’ s so-called net payers , the countries that pay more money into the eu ’ s coffers than they get back , including germany , have said they want to freeze current expenditures .

5 , 2003 .
the european parliament on wednesday will discuss a report on the ten countries set to join the eu next spring .
lithuania is among the ten joining members .

romano prodi ’ s term as european commission president ends in nov .
2004 and a replacement must be found soon .
during the same period , 10 new members will also be joining the eu from eastern and southeastern europe and cyprus .
but that ’ s a development irish foreign minister brian cowen observes positively .
" we want to make sure that the remaining problems are taken care of so that -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion can be executed seamlessly , " cowen said .
in terms of policy , ireland says it wants to promote economic programs in order to fulfill the eu ’ s ambitious goal of becoming the most-innovative region in the world .
compared to the united states , europe has a great social system , ireland ’ s ahern says , but when it comes to research and development and education , europe falls behind it .
but foreign minister cowen believes the real measuring stick for the presidency will be " progress . "
he believes " competitive ability , growth and jobs are , correctly , the questions against which our citizens will judge the success of the european project . "
‘ it ’ s the economy , stupid ! ’
ireland itself has profited considerably since it joined the eu in 1973 .
with the aid of subsidies from brussels , the country was able to regenerate its economy , reduce unemployment and attract foreign investors .
some even started to call it the " celtic tiger . "
meanwhile , the eu has also benefited from ireland 's membership .
the country has gone from being among the poorest in the eu to become a prosperous land that is an eu net payer .
as a strictly neutral country , ireland is not a member of the nato military alliance does not count among the group of european countries calling for a common defense policy .
perhaps wisely considering the political strife that marred the italian presidency , ireland is taking a modest approach to its term at the eu ’ s helm .
cowen has sought to avoid developing major expectations for what ireland ’ s presidency can deliver .

neutral switzerland accepted many refugees but turned away large numbers of jews , apparently out of fear of offending the germans .
but several thousand jewish refugees were helped by local people .
if they were caught , the refugee helpers faced fines , the loss of their jobs and even imprisonment .
in 1942 , a young swiss man , jacob spirig , helped to bring four elderly jewish women over the border from germany into switzerland .
he was caught by the swiss authorities and the women were sent back to concentration camps , where two later died .
jacob spirig was tried by a swiss court and sent to prison .
although switzerland accepted around 300,000 european refugees during the war , historians estimate at least 24,000 people , most of them jews fleeing germany , were turned away .
' too little , too late ' but not everyone supported the official policy of returning the refugees .
many swiss farmers living on the borders , and even policemen and border guards , took pity - they helped refugees to stay and found places for them to hide .
switzerland 's reward for such acts of humanity on the part of its own citizens was harsh : hundreds of people faced prosecution .
they were fined , fired from their jobs and stripped of their pensions ; some served time in prison .
now , over six decades later , a law is coming into force pardoning these people .
many see it as the final chapter in switzerland 's reassessment of its role during world war ii .
the swiss government apologised officially for its treatment of war-time refugees back in 1995 .
but others argue that the law of pardon , which makes no provision for any form of compensation , is far too little and far too late .
jacob spirig , like most of the refugee-helpers , died before he could see his name cleared .

neutral switzerland accepted many refugees but turned away large numbers of jews , apparently out of fear of offending the germans .
but several thousand jewish refugees were helped by local people .
if they were caught , the refugee helpers faced fines , the loss of their jobs and even imprisonment .
jewish refugees were officially rejected by the swiss in 1942 , a young swiss man , jacob spirig , helped to bring four elderly jewish women over the border from germany into switzerland .
he was caught by the swiss authorities and the women were sent back to concentration camps , where two later died .
jacob spirig was tried by a swiss court and sent to prison .
although switzerland accepted around 300,000 european refugees during the war , historians estimate at least 24,000 people , most of them jews fleeing germany , were turned away .
' too little , too late ' but not everyone supported the official policy of returning the refugees .
many swiss farmers living on the borders , and even policemen and border guards , took pity - they helped refugees to stay and found places for them to hide .
switzerland 's reward for such acts of humanity on the part of its own citizens was harsh : hundreds of people faced prosecution .
they were fined , fired from their jobs and stripped of their pensions ; some served time in prison .
now , over six decades later , a law is coming into force pardoning these people .
many see it as the final chapter in switzerland 's reassessment of its role during world war ii .
the swiss government apologised officially for its treatment of war-time refugees back in 1995 .
but others argue that the law of pardon , which makes no provision for any form of compensation , is far too little and far too late .

the visit prompted a swift rebuke from china , whose deputy foreign minister expressed " righteous indignation " on behalf of the people of asia .
it was the fourth such visit by mr koizumi since he took office in 2001 .
the yasukuni shrine honours 2.5 million of the country 's dead in conflicts since 1853 , including a number of war criminals .
these include japan 's wartime prime minister hideki tojo , who was hanged for war crimes in 1948 .
correspondents say mr koizumi 's visits are aimed at pleasing the conservative wing of his liberal democratic party .
visits to the yasukuni shrine always cause a storm but they are opposed by china and other asian countries which japan invaded and occupied at the beginning of the 20th century and during world war ii .
china summoned the acting japanese ambassador to make " solemn representations " over thursday 's visit .
deputy foreign minister wang yi told harada shikahito that it might damage political ties , the xinhua news agency reported .
" the visit not only goes against koizumi 's own promise to exercise introspection when dealing with the history of aggression , " he said .
" it also further undermines the political basis of sino-japanese ties . "
earlier , responding to questions about possible criticism from japan 's neighbours , mr koizumi said : " one does not comment about another country 's respect of its history , traditions or customs . "
a crowd of new year revellers were at the shrine when the prime minister arrived , wearing the long pleated trousers of a traditional , formal costume .
he waved at them as they shouted new year greetings , while he was led up the steps by a shinto priest in white robes .
mr koizumi had earlier attended a ceremony at the imperial palace , which adjoins the yasukuni shrine .
" i feel refreshed , " he said , after his visit to the shrine .
