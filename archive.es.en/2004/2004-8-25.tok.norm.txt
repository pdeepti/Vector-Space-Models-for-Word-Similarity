she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .
i myself had gotten involved in the war and lost many friends .
however , i feel no hatred to the germans .
if this can provide a message to the young generation , then it is a great thing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.08.2004 bremen set the pace for week three 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valdez is one of the stars enjoying the club 's good start reigning champions werder bremen are the team to beat at this early stage of the season with two wins from two games .
here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .
nuremberg remain in the top five with a win and a draw and look forward to remaining there with a good result against bottom club hamburg . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

bayern will hope for a more composed performance after laboring against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium in week two .
the bavarian giants spent most of the game literally battling with berlin in the hard fought 1-1 draw and will be looking for finesse rather than a fight this time out .
felix magath will also hope that his fourth-placed team will not be so profligate in front of goal and that sebastian deisler will remember he plays soccer rather than rugby , forgoing the massive punts up field for the delicate touch he is renowned for . goals by vratislav lokvenc and christoph preuss against bayer leverkusen give bochum renewed faith in their ability to maintain their top flight status for another season .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .
" and that 's good , because we 've come a good bit further today .
the car of reform has started to move . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de monday demonstrations attract fewer marchers the fourth week of " monday demonstrations " against german chancellor gerhard schröder 's welfare reform measures drew tens of thousands of marchers across the country but figures were down from the previous week .
-lrb- august 24 , 2004 -rrb- labor conflict looms at vw carmaker volkswagen could become the next venue for strikes after personnel chief peter hartz called for a two-year wage freeze on monday .
-lrb- august 24 , 2004 -rrb- ex-communists ride high on protest wave the success of germany 's " monday demonstrations , " are symbolic of the unexpected return of the reformed communists , who took a drubbing in the last federal elections but are ahead of the chancellor 's party in some polls .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .

the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.08.2004 bremen set the pace for week three 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valdez is one of the stars enjoying the club 's good start reigning champions werder bremen are the team to beat at this early stage of the season with two wins from two games .
here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.08.2004 bremen set the pace for week three back to first page back 2/2 bottom club hamburg need slice of luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg are down on their luck .
hamburg can be excused for sulking at the foot of the table .
after being soundly beaten by bayern munich in week one , the hamburgers were unlucky to lose 2-1 away at mainz the following week .
daniel van buyten 's opening goal seemed to have turned hamburg 's luck , but defensive frailties and confusion were once again exposed and antonio da silva punished them , not once but twice , to give the newcomers victory .
hamburg will want to stop the slide in the coming game . bayer leverkusen remain unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings after drawing 2-2 with bochum last time out .
leverkusen left it late to achieve parity in the ruhrstadion , relying on ukrainian andrej voronin 's 87th minute equalizer to save the day after going 2-1 down .
they could have joined champions werder bremen at the top of the table if they had beaten bochum but instead remain in fifth place , hoping to grab the top slot in week three against the team just above them , bayern munich . bayern look for return of creative spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler and kovac in a friendlier moment .
bayern will hope for a more composed performance after laboring against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium in week two .
the bavarian giants spent most of the game literally battling with berlin in the hard fought 1-1 draw and will be looking for finesse rather than a fight this time out .
felix magath will also hope that his fourth-placed team will not be so profligate in front of goal and that sebastian deisler will remember he plays soccer rather than rugby , forgoing the massive punts up field for the delicate touch he is renowned for . goals by vratislav lokvenc and christoph preuss against bayer leverkusen give bochum renewed faith in their ability to maintain their top flight status for another season .
the elevators look to have steadied the ship that - until coach peter neururer took charge - had a habit of going up and down as often as their supporters ' heart rates .
two draws and four goals so far hardly inspire championship aspirations , but a good result against arminia bielefeld in week three will take bochum closer to the summit . bielefeld have been rested after their game against hannover was again postponed and will be looking not only for their first win but also their first goals in the bundesliga this season after an opening 0-0 draw with borussia mönchengladbach . freiburg looking to build on late win freiburg will be looking to build on their 1-0 victory over wolfsburg with more of the same against borussia mönchengladbach .
regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute in their last game , and the newly promoted side will want to settle nerves a little quicker this time around .
freiburg 's first away win since they defeated borussia dortmund 1-2 in october 2001 will surely have given them confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian ziege mönchengladbach is another team which can count itself unlucky to have lost its last game .
mönchengladbach were twice in the lead against borussia dortmund in the thriller at the newly opened borussia park stadium in week two , only to eventually lose 3-2 .
ivo ulich 's smart goal from a christian ziege cross and markus hausweiler 's thunderous shot were quality strikes but ultimately not enough .
ziege -lrb- photo -rrb- left the pitch with a thigh strain , and after missing the germany international against austria mid-week , he is a major doubt for the clash with freiburg . nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .
" and that 's good , because we 've come a good bit further today .
the car of reform has started to move .

hamburg can be excused for sulking at the foot of the table .
after being soundly beaten by bayern munich in week one , the hamburgers were unlucky to lose 2-1 away at mainz the following week .
daniel van buyten 's opening goal seemed to have turned hamburg 's luck , but defensive frailties and confusion were once again exposed and antonio da silva punished them , not once but twice , to give the newcomers victory .
hamburg will want to stop the slide in the coming game . bayer leverkusen remain unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings after drawing 2-2 with bochum last time out .
leverkusen left it late to achieve parity in the ruhrstadion , relying on ukrainian andrej voronin 's 87th minute equalizer to save the day after going 2-1 down .
they could have joined champions werder bremen at the top of the table if they had beaten bochum but instead remain in fifth place , hoping to grab the top slot in week three against the team just above them , bayern munich . bayern look for return of creative spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler and kovac in a friendlier moment .
bayern will hope for a more composed performance after laboring against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium in week two .
the bavarian giants spent most of the game literally battling with berlin in the hard fought 1-1 draw and will be looking for finesse rather than a fight this time out .
felix magath will also hope that his fourth-placed team will not be so profligate in front of goal and that sebastian deisler will remember he plays soccer rather than rugby , forgoing the massive punts up field for the delicate touch he is renowned for . goals by vratislav lokvenc and christoph preuss against bayer leverkusen give bochum renewed faith in their ability to maintain their top flight status for another season .
the elevators look to have steadied the ship that - until coach peter neururer took charge - had a habit of going up and down as often as their supporters ' heart rates .
two draws and four goals so far hardly inspire championship aspirations , but a good result against arminia bielefeld in week three will take bochum closer to the summit . bielefeld have been rested after their game against hannover was again postponed and will be looking not only for their first win but also their first goals in the bundesliga this season after an opening 0-0 draw with borussia mönchengladbach . freiburg looking to build on late win freiburg will be looking to build on their 1-0 victory over wolfsburg with more of the same against borussia mönchengladbach .
regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute in their last game , and the newly promoted side will want to settle nerves a little quicker this time around .
freiburg 's first away win since they defeated borussia dortmund 1-2 in october 2001 will surely have given them confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian ziege mönchengladbach is another team which can count itself unlucky to have lost its last game .
mönchengladbach were twice in the lead against borussia dortmund in the thriller at the newly opened borussia park stadium in week two , only to eventually lose 3-2 .
ivo ulich 's smart goal from a christian ziege cross and markus hausweiler 's thunderous shot were quality strikes but ultimately not enough .
ziege -lrb- photo -rrb- left the pitch with a thigh strain , and after missing the germany international against austria mid-week , he is a major doubt for the clash with freiburg . nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .
i myself had gotten involved in the war and lost many friends .
however , i feel no hatred to the germans .
if this can provide a message to the young generation , then it is a great thing .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .
i myself had gotten involved in the war and lost many friends .
however , i feel no hatred to the germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 probe into iraqi prison scandal widens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infamous image that came to represent the horrors at abu ghraib one of the us soldiers accused of abusing iraqi prisoners will plead guilty , it emerged during pre-trial hearings in germany .
separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .
there is both institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels .

separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .

only a day before , the latest in a month long campaign of " monday demonstrations , " as many as 70,000 people once again took to the streets to show exactly what they thought of the government 's plans . the citizens of the east , the region that stands to be affected most by the reforms to cut unemployment benefit among other things , made up most of those who marched .
on tuesday , with the chancellor within striking distance , the protests took a more malevolent turn . whistles and abuse greet schröder during the chancellor 's official speech to mark the prelude of the social democrat 's state election campaign in saxony , schröder was drowned out by whistles , songs and shouts of defamatory abuse as he defended the hartz iv job market reforms .
the chancellor reacted angrily to cries of " betrayer of the working class , " responding by labeling those attempting to shout him down as undemocratic and accusing them of wanting the " destruction of the political culture . " in a television interview that evening with regional broadcaster mdr , schröder said that he could handle protests , even if they were violent , but added that he would not accept the incitement of hatred and the spread of disinformation by radical groups and opposition parties .
" on one side , there is the legitimate fear of what is to come , " schröder said .
" but on the other , there is the fear produced by right-wing radical groups and the -lrb- former communist party -rrb- pds . " eggs fly at wittenburg it had been a long and stressful day for the chancellor .
while visiting a newly renovated train station in wittenberg , schröder narrowly avoided what initial reports described as " a hail of eggs " thrown by protestors livid over the planned labor-market reforms .
what was later reported as " one or two " eggs missed the chancellor but hit journalists traveling with him .
a man also tried to storm the platform from which schröder opened the new € 76 million -lrb- $ 91.8 million -rrb- station and launched a new intercity express train named after the city . " we will continue this process in spite of any protests , " schroeder said shortly after the attack .
he said any reasonable person would support his reforms , which he said are necessary measures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de monday demonstrations attract fewer marchers the fourth week of " monday demonstrations " against german chancellor gerhard schröder 's welfare reform measures drew tens of thousands of marchers across the country but figures were down from the previous week .

a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies .

it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 german group : terror fight violates human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were bound and gagged , but were there human rights violated ?
a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuffed at the ankle and chained to a door handle at abu ghraib the institute report spoke of zones of lawlessness which had developed in the fight against international terrorism after sept .
11 , 2001 .
it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency ministry soldier inspects debris of russian tu-134 , which crushed near the village of buchalki in the tula region early wednesday morning .
afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .
meanwhile , emergency personnel said they had recovered dozens of bodies at both crash sites and were transporting remains to local morgues .
the interfax news agency said debris from the plane that hit the ground near rostov was scattered over fields and forests along a 10-kilometer -lrb- 6.2-mile -rrb- trajectory . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it 's just another example of the lack of concept plaguing the west 's afghanistan policy . if nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer is right in his estimation that the deployment in afghanistan is a crucial measure of the sustainability of the military alliance , then things do n't look too good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai that was apparent even at the nato summit in istanbul at the end of june and it is becoming painfully clearer .
everyone agreed in istanbul that the number of soldiers in afghanistan had to be massively increased in order to secure presidential elections in the country on oct .

afghan president hamid karzai was promised 3,500 soldiers - significantly less than the number the president had requested . at the time , the key question of who would provide the extra soldiers remained open .
since only italy and spain have made corresponding promises since , just 1,800 extra soldiers have been provided . where are the prts ? it 's the same picture when it comes to the provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prt -rrb- that are meant to protect and support civilian and development projects in afghanistan .
before the nato summit , there was talk of a far-reaching network of such prts in northern and western afghanistan .
germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .
and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .
and if all that was n't bad enough , the opium trade has been enjoying an unimagined boom since the end of the taliban regime .
opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .
a complete pull-out , which opposition politicians in germany are advocating , would be the worst alternative .

germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .

opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .
a complete pull-out , which opposition politicians in germany are advocating , would be the worst alternative .
civil war , a further boost to the drug trade and the revival of rich breeding ground for international terrorism , would be the inevitable consequences .
nobody could really want that . that 's why what 's crucially needed are more , and not less , soldiers and in all regions of the country with a significantly wider mandate .

separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency ministry soldier inspects debris of russian tu-134 , which crushed near the village of buchalki in the tula region early wednesday morning .
afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .
meanwhile , emergency personnel said they had recovered dozens of bodies at both crash sites and were transporting remains to local morgues .
the interfax news agency said debris from the plane that hit the ground near rostov was scattered over fields and forests along a 10-kilometer -lrb- 6.2-mile -rrb- trajectory . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency ministry soldier inspects debris of russian tu-134 , which crushed near the village of buchalki in the tula region early wednesday morning .
afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .
meanwhile , emergency personnel said they had recovered dozens of bodies at both crash sites and were transporting remains to local morgues .
the interfax news agency said debris from the plane that hit the ground near rostov was scattered over fields and forests along a 10-kilometer -lrb- 6.2-mile -rrb- trajectory . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor strikes back : schröder faced violent protests the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country . the growing outrage at the german government 's planned welfare and labor reforms manifested itself even more violently on tuesday when chancellor gerhard schröder , the main target of the protests , faced his detractors in two appearances in the eastern heartland of the recent unrest . schröder looked exasperated as he first faced down a " shock and awe " egg-throwing campaign by protesters at an open air event in the east german city of wittenberg and then was harangued with furious whistles and cries of " liar " as he made a speech in leipzig .
only a day before , the latest in a month long campaign of " monday demonstrations , " as many as 70,000 people once again took to the streets to show exactly what they thought of the government 's plans . the citizens of the east , the region that stands to be affected most by the reforms to cut unemployment benefit among other things , made up most of those who marched .
on tuesday , with the chancellor within striking distance , the protests took a more malevolent turn . whistles and abuse greet schröder during the chancellor 's official speech to mark the prelude of the social democrat 's state election campaign in saxony , schröder was drowned out by whistles , songs and shouts of defamatory abuse as he defended the hartz iv job market reforms .
the chancellor reacted angrily to cries of " betrayer of the working class , " responding by labeling those attempting to shout him down as undemocratic and accusing them of wanting the " destruction of the political culture . " in a television interview that evening with regional broadcaster mdr , schröder said that he could handle protests , even if they were violent , but added that he would not accept the incitement of hatred and the spread of disinformation by radical groups and opposition parties .
" on one side , there is the legitimate fear of what is to come , " schröder said .
" but on the other , there is the fear produced by right-wing radical groups and the -lrb- former communist party -rrb- pds . " eggs fly at wittenburg it had been a long and stressful day for the chancellor .
while visiting a newly renovated train station in wittenberg , schröder narrowly avoided what initial reports described as " a hail of eggs " thrown by protestors livid over the planned labor-market reforms .
what was later reported as " one or two " eggs missed the chancellor but hit journalists traveling with him .
a man also tried to storm the platform from which schröder opened the new € 76 million -lrb- $ 91.8 million -rrb- station and launched a new intercity express train named after the city . " we will continue this process in spite of any protests , " schroeder said shortly after the attack .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .
" and that 's good , because we 've come a good bit further today .
the car of reform has started to move .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 opinion : going it alone outside kabul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers will be on their own in faizabad following a futile search for international partners , germany alone will send another reconstruction team to afghanistan .
it 's just another example of the lack of concept plaguing the west 's afghanistan policy . if nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer is right in his estimation that the deployment in afghanistan is a crucial measure of the sustainability of the military alliance , then things do n't look too good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai that was apparent even at the nato summit in istanbul at the end of june and it is becoming painfully clearer .
everyone agreed in istanbul that the number of soldiers in afghanistan had to be massively increased in order to secure presidential elections in the country on oct .
9 .
afghan president hamid karzai was promised 3,500 soldiers - significantly less than the number the president had requested . at the time , the key question of who would provide the extra soldiers remained open .
since only italy and spain have made corresponding promises since , just 1,800 extra soldiers have been provided . where are the prts ? it 's the same picture when it comes to the provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prt -rrb- that are meant to protect and support civilian and development projects in afghanistan .
before the nato summit , there was talk of a far-reaching network of such prts in northern and western afghanistan .
germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .
and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .
and if all that was n't bad enough , the opium trade has been enjoying an unimagined boom since the end of the taliban regime .
opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .
a complete pull-out , which opposition politicians in germany are advocating , would be the worst alternative .
civil war , a further boost to the drug trade and the revival of rich breeding ground for international terrorism , would be the inevitable consequences .
nobody could really want that . that 's why what 's crucially needed are more , and not less , soldiers and in all regions of the country with a significantly wider mandate .
and as far as nato 's sustainability goes : the strength of the alliance is not just measured by its military capabilities , but also on the basis of the capacity to match inadequate plans to real needs . or at least to the willingness of its members , to honor and implement decisions that have been taken jointly .
in the case of afghanistan , this means sending more soldiers immediately . felix steiner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack raises questions over german presence in kunduz a bomb attack in the northern afghan province of kunduz that appears to have targeted a car belonging to german-led peacekeepers has opposition politicians in germany questioning the strategy for stabilizing the region .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency ministry soldier inspects debris of russian tu-134 , which crushed near the village of buchalki in the tula region early wednesday morning .
afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency ministry soldier inspects debris of russian tu-134 , which crushed near the village of buchalki in the tula region early wednesday morning .
afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .
meanwhile , emergency personnel said they had recovered dozens of bodies at both crash sites and were transporting remains to local morgues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor strikes back : schröder faced violent protests the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country . the growing outrage at the german government 's planned welfare and labor reforms manifested itself even more violently on tuesday when chancellor gerhard schröder , the main target of the protests , faced his detractors in two appearances in the eastern heartland of the recent unrest . schröder looked exasperated as he first faced down a " shock and awe " egg-throwing campaign by protesters at an open air event in the east german city of wittenberg and then was harangued with furious whistles and cries of " liar " as he made a speech in leipzig .
only a day before , the latest in a month long campaign of " monday demonstrations , " as many as 70,000 people once again took to the streets to show exactly what they thought of the government 's plans . the citizens of the east , the region that stands to be affected most by the reforms to cut unemployment benefit among other things , made up most of those who marched .
on tuesday , with the chancellor within striking distance , the protests took a more malevolent turn . whistles and abuse greet schröder during the chancellor 's official speech to mark the prelude of the social democrat 's state election campaign in saxony , schröder was drowned out by whistles , songs and shouts of defamatory abuse as he defended the hartz iv job market reforms .
the chancellor reacted angrily to cries of " betrayer of the working class , " responding by labeling those attempting to shout him down as undemocratic and accusing them of wanting the " destruction of the political culture . " in a television interview that evening with regional broadcaster mdr , schröder said that he could handle protests , even if they were violent , but added that he would not accept the incitement of hatred and the spread of disinformation by radical groups and opposition parties .
" on one side , there is the legitimate fear of what is to come , " schröder said .
" but on the other , there is the fear produced by right-wing radical groups and the -lrb- former communist party -rrb- pds . " eggs fly at wittenburg it had been a long and stressful day for the chancellor .
while visiting a newly renovated train station in wittenberg , schröder narrowly avoided what initial reports described as " a hail of eggs " thrown by protestors livid over the planned labor-market reforms .
what was later reported as " one or two " eggs missed the chancellor but hit journalists traveling with him .
a man also tried to storm the platform from which schröder opened the new € 76 million -lrb- $ 91.8 million -rrb- station and launched a new intercity express train named after the city . " we will continue this process in spite of any protests , " schroeder said shortly after the attack .
he said any reasonable person would support his reforms , which he said are necessary measures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de monday demonstrations attract fewer marchers the fourth week of " monday demonstrations " against german chancellor gerhard schröder 's welfare reform measures drew tens of thousands of marchers across the country but figures were down from the previous week .

separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor strikes back : schröder faced violent protests the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country . the growing outrage at the german government 's planned welfare and labor reforms manifested itself even more violently on tuesday when chancellor gerhard schröder , the main target of the protests , faced his detractors in two appearances in the eastern heartland of the recent unrest . schröder looked exasperated as he first faced down a " shock and awe " egg-throwing campaign by protesters at an open air event in the east german city of wittenberg and then was harangued with furious whistles and cries of " liar " as he made a speech in leipzig .
only a day before , the latest in a month long campaign of " monday demonstrations , " as many as 70,000 people once again took to the streets to show exactly what they thought of the government 's plans . the citizens of the east , the region that stands to be affected most by the reforms to cut unemployment benefit among other things , made up most of those who marched .
on tuesday , with the chancellor within striking distance , the protests took a more malevolent turn . whistles and abuse greet schröder during the chancellor 's official speech to mark the prelude of the social democrat 's state election campaign in saxony , schröder was drowned out by whistles , songs and shouts of defamatory abuse as he defended the hartz iv job market reforms .
the chancellor reacted angrily to cries of " betrayer of the working class , " responding by labeling those attempting to shout him down as undemocratic and accusing them of wanting the " destruction of the political culture . " in a television interview that evening with regional broadcaster mdr , schröder said that he could handle protests , even if they were violent , but added that he would not accept the incitement of hatred and the spread of disinformation by radical groups and opposition parties .
" on one side , there is the legitimate fear of what is to come , " schröder said .
" but on the other , there is the fear produced by right-wing radical groups and the -lrb- former communist party -rrb- pds . " eggs fly at wittenburg it had been a long and stressful day for the chancellor .
while visiting a newly renovated train station in wittenberg , schröder narrowly avoided what initial reports described as " a hail of eggs " thrown by protestors livid over the planned labor-market reforms .
what was later reported as " one or two " eggs missed the chancellor but hit journalists traveling with him .
a man also tried to storm the platform from which schröder opened the new € 76 million -lrb- $ 91.8 million -rrb- station and launched a new intercity express train named after the city . " we will continue this process in spite of any protests , " schroeder said shortly after the attack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 opinion : going it alone outside kabul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers will be on their own in faizabad following a futile search for international partners , germany alone will send another reconstruction team to afghanistan .
it 's just another example of the lack of concept plaguing the west 's afghanistan policy . if nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer is right in his estimation that the deployment in afghanistan is a crucial measure of the sustainability of the military alliance , then things do n't look too good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai that was apparent even at the nato summit in istanbul at the end of june and it is becoming painfully clearer .
everyone agreed in istanbul that the number of soldiers in afghanistan had to be massively increased in order to secure presidential elections in the country on oct .
9 .
afghan president hamid karzai was promised 3,500 soldiers - significantly less than the number the president had requested . at the time , the key question of who would provide the extra soldiers remained open .
since only italy and spain have made corresponding promises since , just 1,800 extra soldiers have been provided . where are the prts ? it 's the same picture when it comes to the provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prt -rrb- that are meant to protect and support civilian and development projects in afghanistan .
before the nato summit , there was talk of a far-reaching network of such prts in northern and western afghanistan .
germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .
and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .
and if all that was n't bad enough , the opium trade has been enjoying an unimagined boom since the end of the taliban regime .
opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .
a complete pull-out , which opposition politicians in germany are advocating , would be the worst alternative .
civil war , a further boost to the drug trade and the revival of rich breeding ground for international terrorism , would be the inevitable consequences .
nobody could really want that . that 's why what 's crucially needed are more , and not less , soldiers and in all regions of the country with a significantly wider mandate .
and as far as nato 's sustainability goes : the strength of the alliance is not just measured by its military capabilities , but also on the basis of the capacity to match inadequate plans to real needs . or at least to the willingness of its members , to honor and implement decisions that have been taken jointly .
in the case of afghanistan , this means sending more soldiers immediately . felix steiner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack raises questions over german presence in kunduz a bomb attack in the northern afghan province of kunduz that appears to have targeted a car belonging to german-led peacekeepers has opposition politicians in germany questioning the strategy for stabilizing the region .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .
" and that 's good , because we 've come a good bit further today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 german group : terror fight violates human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were bound and gagged , but were there human rights violated ?
a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuffed at the ankle and chained to a door handle at abu ghraib the institute report spoke of zones of lawlessness which had developed in the fight against international terrorism after sept .
11 , 2001 .
it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "
the german institute for human rights was founded in march 2001 with the aim of reporting on the international and domestic human rights at regular intervals .
it sees itself as politically independent , although it is co-financed by the federal ministries of justice , development , and foreign affairs . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de abu ghraib hearing underway in germany charles graner , the suspected ringleader in the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal and three others are facing pre-trial hearings in germany , marked by warnings by the judge for the us to speed up investigations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 opinion : going it alone outside kabul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers will be on their own in faizabad following a futile search for international partners , germany alone will send another reconstruction team to afghanistan .
it 's just another example of the lack of concept plaguing the west 's afghanistan policy . if nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer is right in his estimation that the deployment in afghanistan is a crucial measure of the sustainability of the military alliance , then things do n't look too good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai that was apparent even at the nato summit in istanbul at the end of june and it is becoming painfully clearer .
everyone agreed in istanbul that the number of soldiers in afghanistan had to be massively increased in order to secure presidential elections in the country on oct .
9 .
afghan president hamid karzai was promised 3,500 soldiers - significantly less than the number the president had requested . at the time , the key question of who would provide the extra soldiers remained open .
since only italy and spain have made corresponding promises since , just 1,800 extra soldiers have been provided . where are the prts ? it 's the same picture when it comes to the provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prt -rrb- that are meant to protect and support civilian and development projects in afghanistan .
before the nato summit , there was talk of a far-reaching network of such prts in northern and western afghanistan .
germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .
and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .

germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 probe into iraqi prison scandal widens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infamous image that came to represent the horrors at abu ghraib one of the us soldiers accused of abusing iraqi prisoners will plead guilty , it emerged during pre-trial hearings in germany .
separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .
there is both institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels .

separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .
there is both institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .
i myself had gotten involved in the war and lost many friends .
however , i feel no hatred to the germans .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .
i myself had gotten involved in the war and lost many friends .
however , i feel no hatred to the germans .
if this can provide a message to the young generation , then it is a great thing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 probe into iraqi prison scandal widens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infamous image that came to represent the horrors at abu ghraib one of the us soldiers accused of abusing iraqi prisoners will plead guilty , it emerged during pre-trial hearings in germany .
separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .
there is both institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels .

only a day before , the latest in a month long campaign of " monday demonstrations , " as many as 70,000 people once again took to the streets to show exactly what they thought of the government 's plans . the citizens of the east , the region that stands to be affected most by the reforms to cut unemployment benefit among other things , made up most of those who marched .
on tuesday , with the chancellor within striking distance , the protests took a more malevolent turn . whistles and abuse greet schröder during the chancellor 's official speech to mark the prelude of the social democrat 's state election campaign in saxony , schröder was drowned out by whistles , songs and shouts of defamatory abuse as he defended the hartz iv job market reforms .
the chancellor reacted angrily to cries of " betrayer of the working class , " responding by labeling those attempting to shout him down as undemocratic and accusing them of wanting the " destruction of the political culture . " in a television interview that evening with regional broadcaster mdr , schröder said that he could handle protests , even if they were violent , but added that he would not accept the incitement of hatred and the spread of disinformation by radical groups and opposition parties .
" on one side , there is the legitimate fear of what is to come , " schröder said .
" but on the other , there is the fear produced by right-wing radical groups and the -lrb- former communist party -rrb- pds . " eggs fly at wittenburg it had been a long and stressful day for the chancellor .
while visiting a newly renovated train station in wittenberg , schröder narrowly avoided what initial reports described as " a hail of eggs " thrown by protestors livid over the planned labor-market reforms .
what was later reported as " one or two " eggs missed the chancellor but hit journalists traveling with him .
a man also tried to storm the platform from which schröder opened the new € 76 million -lrb- $ 91.8 million -rrb- station and launched a new intercity express train named after the city . " we will continue this process in spite of any protests , " schroeder said shortly after the attack .

a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "

it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "

a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "

it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency ministry soldier inspects debris of russian tu-134 , which crushed near the village of buchalki in the tula region early wednesday morning .
afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .
meanwhile , emergency personnel said they had recovered dozens of bodies at both crash sites and were transporting remains to local morgues .
the interfax news agency said debris from the plane that hit the ground near rostov was scattered over fields and forests along a 10-kilometer -lrb- 6.2-mile -rrb- trajectory . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency ministry soldier inspects debris of russian tu-134 , which crushed near the village of buchalki in the tula region early wednesday morning .
afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.08.2004 bremen set the pace for week three 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valdez is one of the stars enjoying the club 's good start reigning champions werder bremen are the team to beat at this early stage of the season with two wins from two games .
here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .
nuremberg remain in the top five with a win and a draw and look forward to remaining there with a good result against bottom club hamburg . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

hamburg can be excused for sulking at the foot of the table .
after being soundly beaten by bayern munich in week one , the hamburgers were unlucky to lose 2-1 away at mainz the following week .
daniel van buyten 's opening goal seemed to have turned hamburg 's luck , but defensive frailties and confusion were once again exposed and antonio da silva punished them , not once but twice , to give the newcomers victory .
hamburg will want to stop the slide in the coming game . bayer leverkusen remain unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings after drawing 2-2 with bochum last time out .
leverkusen left it late to achieve parity in the ruhrstadion , relying on ukrainian andrej voronin 's 87th minute equalizer to save the day after going 2-1 down .
they could have joined champions werder bremen at the top of the table if they had beaten bochum but instead remain in fifth place , hoping to grab the top slot in week three against the team just above them , bayern munich . bayern look for return of creative spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler and kovac in a friendlier moment .
bayern will hope for a more composed performance after laboring against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium in week two .
the bavarian giants spent most of the game literally battling with berlin in the hard fought 1-1 draw and will be looking for finesse rather than a fight this time out .
felix magath will also hope that his fourth-placed team will not be so profligate in front of goal and that sebastian deisler will remember he plays soccer rather than rugby , forgoing the massive punts up field for the delicate touch he is renowned for . goals by vratislav lokvenc and christoph preuss against bayer leverkusen give bochum renewed faith in their ability to maintain their top flight status for another season .
the elevators look to have steadied the ship that - until coach peter neururer took charge - had a habit of going up and down as often as their supporters ' heart rates .
two draws and four goals so far hardly inspire championship aspirations , but a good result against arminia bielefeld in week three will take bochum closer to the summit . bielefeld have been rested after their game against hannover was again postponed and will be looking not only for their first win but also their first goals in the bundesliga this season after an opening 0-0 draw with borussia mönchengladbach . freiburg looking to build on late win freiburg will be looking to build on their 1-0 victory over wolfsburg with more of the same against borussia mönchengladbach .
regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute in their last game , and the newly promoted side will want to settle nerves a little quicker this time around .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor strikes back : schröder faced violent protests the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country . the growing outrage at the german government 's planned welfare and labor reforms manifested itself even more violently on tuesday when chancellor gerhard schröder , the main target of the protests , faced his detractors in two appearances in the eastern heartland of the recent unrest . schröder looked exasperated as he first faced down a " shock and awe " egg-throwing campaign by protesters at an open air event in the east german city of wittenberg and then was harangued with furious whistles and cries of " liar " as he made a speech in leipzig .
only a day before , the latest in a month long campaign of " monday demonstrations , " as many as 70,000 people once again took to the streets to show exactly what they thought of the government 's plans . the citizens of the east , the region that stands to be affected most by the reforms to cut unemployment benefit among other things , made up most of those who marched .
on tuesday , with the chancellor within striking distance , the protests took a more malevolent turn . whistles and abuse greet schröder during the chancellor 's official speech to mark the prelude of the social democrat 's state election campaign in saxony , schröder was drowned out by whistles , songs and shouts of defamatory abuse as he defended the hartz iv job market reforms .
the chancellor reacted angrily to cries of " betrayer of the working class , " responding by labeling those attempting to shout him down as undemocratic and accusing them of wanting the " destruction of the political culture .

separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .
there is both institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 probe into iraqi prison scandal widens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infamous image that came to represent the horrors at abu ghraib one of the us soldiers accused of abusing iraqi prisoners will plead guilty , it emerged during pre-trial hearings in germany .
separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .

it 's just another example of the lack of concept plaguing the west 's afghanistan policy . if nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer is right in his estimation that the deployment in afghanistan is a crucial measure of the sustainability of the military alliance , then things do n't look too good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai that was apparent even at the nato summit in istanbul at the end of june and it is becoming painfully clearer .
everyone agreed in istanbul that the number of soldiers in afghanistan had to be massively increased in order to secure presidential elections in the country on oct .
9 .
afghan president hamid karzai was promised 3,500 soldiers - significantly less than the number the president had requested . at the time , the key question of who would provide the extra soldiers remained open .
since only italy and spain have made corresponding promises since , just 1,800 extra soldiers have been provided . where are the prts ? it 's the same picture when it comes to the provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prt -rrb- that are meant to protect and support civilian and development projects in afghanistan .
before the nato summit , there was talk of a far-reaching network of such prts in northern and western afghanistan .
germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .
and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .
and if all that was n't bad enough , the opium trade has been enjoying an unimagined boom since the end of the taliban regime .
opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .
a complete pull-out , which opposition politicians in germany are advocating , would be the worst alternative .
civil war , a further boost to the drug trade and the revival of rich breeding ground for international terrorism , would be the inevitable consequences .
nobody could really want that . that 's why what 's crucially needed are more , and not less , soldiers and in all regions of the country with a significantly wider mandate .
and as far as nato 's sustainability goes : the strength of the alliance is not just measured by its military capabilities , but also on the basis of the capacity to match inadequate plans to real needs . or at least to the willingness of its members , to honor and implement decisions that have been taken jointly .
in the case of afghanistan , this means sending more soldiers immediately . felix steiner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack raises questions over german presence in kunduz a bomb attack in the northern afghan province of kunduz that appears to have targeted a car belonging to german-led peacekeepers has opposition politicians in germany questioning the strategy for stabilizing the region .

it 's just another example of the lack of concept plaguing the west 's afghanistan policy . if nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer is right in his estimation that the deployment in afghanistan is a crucial measure of the sustainability of the military alliance , then things do n't look too good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai that was apparent even at the nato summit in istanbul at the end of june and it is becoming painfully clearer .
everyone agreed in istanbul that the number of soldiers in afghanistan had to be massively increased in order to secure presidential elections in the country on oct .
9 .
afghan president hamid karzai was promised 3,500 soldiers - significantly less than the number the president had requested . at the time , the key question of who would provide the extra soldiers remained open .
since only italy and spain have made corresponding promises since , just 1,800 extra soldiers have been provided . where are the prts ? it 's the same picture when it comes to the provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prt -rrb- that are meant to protect and support civilian and development projects in afghanistan .
before the nato summit , there was talk of a far-reaching network of such prts in northern and western afghanistan .
germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .
and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .
and if all that was n't bad enough , the opium trade has been enjoying an unimagined boom since the end of the taliban regime .
opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .
a complete pull-out , which opposition politicians in germany are advocating , would be the worst alternative .
civil war , a further boost to the drug trade and the revival of rich breeding ground for international terrorism , would be the inevitable consequences .
nobody could really want that . that 's why what 's crucially needed are more , and not less , soldiers and in all regions of the country with a significantly wider mandate .
and as far as nato 's sustainability goes : the strength of the alliance is not just measured by its military capabilities , but also on the basis of the capacity to match inadequate plans to real needs . or at least to the willingness of its members , to honor and implement decisions that have been taken jointly .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .
i myself had gotten involved in the war and lost many friends .
however , i feel no hatred to the germans .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .
i myself had gotten involved in the war and lost many friends .

riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .
i myself had gotten involved in the war and lost many friends .
however , i feel no hatred to the germans .
if this can provide a message to the young generation , then it is a great thing .

a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuffed at the ankle and chained to a door handle at abu ghraib the institute report spoke of zones of lawlessness which had developed in the fight against international terrorism after sept .
11 , 2001 .
it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .

hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .
" and that 's good , because we 've come a good bit further today .
the car of reform has started to move .

a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "

it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "

" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuffed at the ankle and chained to a door handle at abu ghraib the institute report spoke of zones of lawlessness which had developed in the fight against international terrorism after sept .
11 , 2001 .
it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "
the german institute for human rights was founded in march 2001 with the aim of reporting on the international and domestic human rights at regular intervals .
it sees itself as politically independent , although it is co-financed by the federal ministries of justice , development , and foreign affairs . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de abu ghraib hearing underway in germany charles graner , the suspected ringleader in the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal and three others are facing pre-trial hearings in germany , marked by warnings by the judge for the us to speed up investigations .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .

afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .

chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .

officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .

a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.08.2004 bremen set the pace for week three 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valdez is one of the stars enjoying the club 's good start reigning champions werder bremen are the team to beat at this early stage of the season with two wins from two games .
here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .
nuremberg remain in the top five with a win and a draw and look forward to remaining there with a good result against bottom club hamburg . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .

hamburg can be excused for sulking at the foot of the table .
after being soundly beaten by bayern munich in week one , the hamburgers were unlucky to lose 2-1 away at mainz the following week .
daniel van buyten 's opening goal seemed to have turned hamburg 's luck , but defensive frailties and confusion were once again exposed and antonio da silva punished them , not once but twice , to give the newcomers victory .
hamburg will want to stop the slide in the coming game . bayer leverkusen remain unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings after drawing 2-2 with bochum last time out .
leverkusen left it late to achieve parity in the ruhrstadion , relying on ukrainian andrej voronin 's 87th minute equalizer to save the day after going 2-1 down .
they could have joined champions werder bremen at the top of the table if they had beaten bochum but instead remain in fifth place , hoping to grab the top slot in week three against the team just above them , bayern munich . bayern look for return of creative spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler and kovac in a friendlier moment .
bayern will hope for a more composed performance after laboring against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium in week two .
the bavarian giants spent most of the game literally battling with berlin in the hard fought 1-1 draw and will be looking for finesse rather than a fight this time out .
felix magath will also hope that his fourth-placed team will not be so profligate in front of goal and that sebastian deisler will remember he plays soccer rather than rugby , forgoing the massive punts up field for the delicate touch he is renowned for . goals by vratislav lokvenc and christoph preuss against bayer leverkusen give bochum renewed faith in their ability to maintain their top flight status for another season .
the elevators look to have steadied the ship that - until coach peter neururer took charge - had a habit of going up and down as often as their supporters ' heart rates .
two draws and four goals so far hardly inspire championship aspirations , but a good result against arminia bielefeld in week three will take bochum closer to the summit . bielefeld have been rested after their game against hannover was again postponed and will be looking not only for their first win but also their first goals in the bundesliga this season after an opening 0-0 draw with borussia mönchengladbach . freiburg looking to build on late win freiburg will be looking to build on their 1-0 victory over wolfsburg with more of the same against borussia mönchengladbach .
regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute in their last game , and the newly promoted side will want to settle nerves a little quicker this time around .

mönchengladbach were twice in the lead against borussia dortmund in the thriller at the newly opened borussia park stadium in week two , only to eventually lose 3-2 .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 probe into iraqi prison scandal widens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infamous image that came to represent the horrors at abu ghraib one of the us soldiers accused of abusing iraqi prisoners will plead guilty , it emerged during pre-trial hearings in germany .
separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .
there is both institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .

afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .
meanwhile , emergency personnel said they had recovered dozens of bodies at both crash sites and were transporting remains to local morgues .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency ministry soldier inspects debris of russian tu-134 , which crushed near the village of buchalki in the tula region early wednesday morning .
afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .
meanwhile , emergency personnel said they had recovered dozens of bodies at both crash sites and were transporting remains to local morgues .
the interfax news agency said debris from the plane that hit the ground near rostov was scattered over fields and forests along a 10-kilometer -lrb- 6.2-mile -rrb- trajectory . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 probe into iraqi prison scandal widens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infamous image that came to represent the horrors at abu ghraib one of the us soldiers accused of abusing iraqi prisoners will plead guilty , it emerged during pre-trial hearings in germany .
separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .
there is both institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels .

it 's just another example of the lack of concept plaguing the west 's afghanistan policy . if nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer is right in his estimation that the deployment in afghanistan is a crucial measure of the sustainability of the military alliance , then things do n't look too good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai that was apparent even at the nato summit in istanbul at the end of june and it is becoming painfully clearer .
everyone agreed in istanbul that the number of soldiers in afghanistan had to be massively increased in order to secure presidential elections in the country on oct .
9 .
afghan president hamid karzai was promised 3,500 soldiers - significantly less than the number the president had requested . at the time , the key question of who would provide the extra soldiers remained open .
since only italy and spain have made corresponding promises since , just 1,800 extra soldiers have been provided . where are the prts ? it 's the same picture when it comes to the provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prt -rrb- that are meant to protect and support civilian and development projects in afghanistan .
before the nato summit , there was talk of a far-reaching network of such prts in northern and western afghanistan .
germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .
and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .
and if all that was n't bad enough , the opium trade has been enjoying an unimagined boom since the end of the taliban regime .
opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .
a complete pull-out , which opposition politicians in germany are advocating , would be the worst alternative .
civil war , a further boost to the drug trade and the revival of rich breeding ground for international terrorism , would be the inevitable consequences .
nobody could really want that . that 's why what 's crucially needed are more , and not less , soldiers and in all regions of the country with a significantly wider mandate .
and as far as nato 's sustainability goes : the strength of the alliance is not just measured by its military capabilities , but also on the basis of the capacity to match inadequate plans to real needs . or at least to the willingness of its members , to honor and implement decisions that have been taken jointly .
in the case of afghanistan , this means sending more soldiers immediately . felix steiner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack raises questions over german presence in kunduz a bomb attack in the northern afghan province of kunduz that appears to have targeted a car belonging to german-led peacekeepers has opposition politicians in germany questioning the strategy for stabilizing the region .

it 's just another example of the lack of concept plaguing the west 's afghanistan policy . if nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer is right in his estimation that the deployment in afghanistan is a crucial measure of the sustainability of the military alliance , then things do n't look too good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai that was apparent even at the nato summit in istanbul at the end of june and it is becoming painfully clearer .
everyone agreed in istanbul that the number of soldiers in afghanistan had to be massively increased in order to secure presidential elections in the country on oct .
9 .
afghan president hamid karzai was promised 3,500 soldiers - significantly less than the number the president had requested . at the time , the key question of who would provide the extra soldiers remained open .
since only italy and spain have made corresponding promises since , just 1,800 extra soldiers have been provided . where are the prts ? it 's the same picture when it comes to the provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prt -rrb- that are meant to protect and support civilian and development projects in afghanistan .
before the nato summit , there was talk of a far-reaching network of such prts in northern and western afghanistan .
germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .
and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .
and if all that was n't bad enough , the opium trade has been enjoying an unimagined boom since the end of the taliban regime .
opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .

a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuffed at the ankle and chained to a door handle at abu ghraib the institute report spoke of zones of lawlessness which had developed in the fight against international terrorism after sept .
11 , 2001 .
it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "

a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuffed at the ankle and chained to a door handle at abu ghraib the institute report spoke of zones of lawlessness which had developed in the fight against international terrorism after sept .
11 , 2001 .
it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "
the german institute for human rights was founded in march 2001 with the aim of reporting on the international and domestic human rights at regular intervals .
it sees itself as politically independent , although it is co-financed by the federal ministries of justice , development , and foreign affairs . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de abu ghraib hearing underway in germany charles graner , the suspected ringleader in the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal and three others are facing pre-trial hearings in germany , marked by warnings by the judge for the us to speed up investigations .

separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .
there is both institutional and personal responsibility at higher levels .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .

paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !

it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .
i myself had gotten involved in the war and lost many friends .
however , i feel no hatred to the germans .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .

hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .

afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .
meanwhile , emergency personnel said they had recovered dozens of bodies at both crash sites and were transporting remains to local morgues .

separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 probe into iraqi prison scandal widens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an infamous image that came to represent the horrors at abu ghraib one of the us soldiers accused of abusing iraqi prisoners will plead guilty , it emerged during pre-trial hearings in germany .
separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2004 german group : terror fight violates human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were bound and gagged , but were there human rights violated ?
a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuffed at the ankle and chained to a door handle at abu ghraib the institute report spoke of zones of lawlessness which had developed in the fight against international terrorism after sept .
11 , 2001 .
it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "
the german institute for human rights was founded in march 2001 with the aim of reporting on the international and domestic human rights at regular intervals .
it sees itself as politically independent , although it is co-financed by the federal ministries of justice , development , and foreign affairs . hardy graupner -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de abu ghraib hearing underway in germany charles graner , the suspected ringleader in the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal and three others are facing pre-trial hearings in germany , marked by warnings by the judge for the us to speed up investigations .

jil sander , one of germany 's most famous designers , has turned on the native male and accused him of neglecting fashion more than ever before .
but rather than just sniping at the kind of fashion mistakes which can only be attributed to getting dressed in the dark , sander offers her own insight into the causes of the problem . economic climate hinders fashion sense sander believes that german men have been hardest hit by the current financial climate in europe 's lumbering economic monster , not in the pocket as such but certainly in the trousers . the designer added in a column in the fivetonine lifestyle magazine that german men have reacted to the country 's economic downturn by sacrificing style in favor of saving .
men 's fashion sense , she claims , is therefore suffering from the fact that they would rather horde their money than splash out on some decent clothes . as a result , the majority of wardrobes fail to be updated and slip into a kind of fashion time warp while the men wait for the right economic climate to arrive . businessmen are not immune sander also made some observations about the sartorially-challenged men of her native land who should really know better : " look at the businessmen in their shoulder pads which look from the back like they 're made of cardboard ; with the huge sleeves , the creases and the fact that the whole body is covered .
this is the instinct of the herd , to look identical with no attempt to look striking . " however , there does seem to be some hope .

but rather than just sniping at the kind of fashion mistakes which can only be attributed to getting dressed in the dark , sander offers her own insight into the causes of the problem . economic climate hinders fashion sense sander believes that german men have been hardest hit by the current financial climate in europe 's lumbering economic monster , not in the pocket as such but certainly in the trousers . the designer added in a column in the fivetonine lifestyle magazine that german men have reacted to the country 's economic downturn by sacrificing style in favor of saving .
men 's fashion sense , she claims , is therefore suffering from the fact that they would rather horde their money than splash out on some decent clothes . as a result , the majority of wardrobes fail to be updated and slip into a kind of fashion time warp while the men wait for the right economic climate to arrive . businessmen are not immune sander also made some observations about the sartorially-challenged men of her native land who should really know better : " look at the businessmen in their shoulder pads which look from the back like they 're made of cardboard ; with the huge sleeves , the creases and the fact that the whole body is covered .
this is the instinct of the herd , to look identical with no attempt to look striking . " however , there does seem to be some hope .
sander held up the example of one man , who she believes should be a beacon in these dark times for german men 's fashion and style : " -lrb- state broadcaster -rrb- ard presenter reinhold beckmann .
this is an intelligent man , he looks good , he has a great posture and his figure is also in order .

a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuffed at the ankle and chained to a door handle at abu ghraib the institute report spoke of zones of lawlessness which had developed in the fight against international terrorism after sept .
11 , 2001 .
it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "

a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "

it 's just another example of the lack of concept plaguing the west 's afghanistan policy . if nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer is right in his estimation that the deployment in afghanistan is a crucial measure of the sustainability of the military alliance , then things do n't look too good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai that was apparent even at the nato summit in istanbul at the end of june and it is becoming painfully clearer .
everyone agreed in istanbul that the number of soldiers in afghanistan had to be massively increased in order to secure presidential elections in the country on oct .
9 .
afghan president hamid karzai was promised 3,500 soldiers - significantly less than the number the president had requested . at the time , the key question of who would provide the extra soldiers remained open .
since only italy and spain have made corresponding promises since , just 1,800 extra soldiers have been provided . where are the prts ? it 's the same picture when it comes to the provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prt -rrb- that are meant to protect and support civilian and development projects in afghanistan .
before the nato summit , there was talk of a far-reaching network of such prts in northern and western afghanistan .
germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .
and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .
and if all that was n't bad enough , the opium trade has been enjoying an unimagined boom since the end of the taliban regime .
opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .
a complete pull-out , which opposition politicians in germany are advocating , would be the worst alternative .
civil war , a further boost to the drug trade and the revival of rich breeding ground for international terrorism , would be the inevitable consequences .
nobody could really want that . that 's why what 's crucially needed are more , and not less , soldiers and in all regions of the country with a significantly wider mandate .
and as far as nato 's sustainability goes : the strength of the alliance is not just measured by its military capabilities , but also on the basis of the capacity to match inadequate plans to real needs . or at least to the willingness of its members , to honor and implement decisions that have been taken jointly .

it 's just another example of the lack of concept plaguing the west 's afghanistan policy . if nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer is right in his estimation that the deployment in afghanistan is a crucial measure of the sustainability of the military alliance , then things do n't look too good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai that was apparent even at the nato summit in istanbul at the end of june and it is becoming painfully clearer .
everyone agreed in istanbul that the number of soldiers in afghanistan had to be massively increased in order to secure presidential elections in the country on oct .
9 .
afghan president hamid karzai was promised 3,500 soldiers - significantly less than the number the president had requested . at the time , the key question of who would provide the extra soldiers remained open .
since only italy and spain have made corresponding promises since , just 1,800 extra soldiers have been provided . where are the prts ? it 's the same picture when it comes to the provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prt -rrb- that are meant to protect and support civilian and development projects in afghanistan .
before the nato summit , there was talk of a far-reaching network of such prts in northern and western afghanistan .
germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .
and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .
and if all that was n't bad enough , the opium trade has been enjoying an unimagined boom since the end of the taliban regime .
opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .
a complete pull-out , which opposition politicians in germany are advocating , would be the worst alternative .
civil war , a further boost to the drug trade and the revival of rich breeding ground for international terrorism , would be the inevitable consequences .
nobody could really want that . that 's why what 's crucially needed are more , and not less , soldiers and in all regions of the country with a significantly wider mandate .
and as far as nato 's sustainability goes : the strength of the alliance is not just measured by its military capabilities , but also on the basis of the capacity to match inadequate plans to real needs . or at least to the willingness of its members , to honor and implement decisions that have been taken jointly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.08.2004 bremen set the pace for week three 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valdez is one of the stars enjoying the club 's good start reigning champions werder bremen are the team to beat at this early stage of the season with two wins from two games .
here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .
nuremberg remain in the top five with a win and a draw and look forward to remaining there with a good result against bottom club hamburg . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

hamburg can be excused for sulking at the foot of the table .
after being soundly beaten by bayern munich in week one , the hamburgers were unlucky to lose 2-1 away at mainz the following week .
daniel van buyten 's opening goal seemed to have turned hamburg 's luck , but defensive frailties and confusion were once again exposed and antonio da silva punished them , not once but twice , to give the newcomers victory .
hamburg will want to stop the slide in the coming game . bayer leverkusen remain unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings after drawing 2-2 with bochum last time out .
leverkusen left it late to achieve parity in the ruhrstadion , relying on ukrainian andrej voronin 's 87th minute equalizer to save the day after going 2-1 down .
they could have joined champions werder bremen at the top of the table if they had beaten bochum but instead remain in fifth place , hoping to grab the top slot in week three against the team just above them , bayern munich . bayern look for return of creative spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler and kovac in a friendlier moment .
bayern will hope for a more composed performance after laboring against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium in week two .
the bavarian giants spent most of the game literally battling with berlin in the hard fought 1-1 draw and will be looking for finesse rather than a fight this time out .
felix magath will also hope that his fourth-placed team will not be so profligate in front of goal and that sebastian deisler will remember he plays soccer rather than rugby , forgoing the massive punts up field for the delicate touch he is renowned for . goals by vratislav lokvenc and christoph preuss against bayer leverkusen give bochum renewed faith in their ability to maintain their top flight status for another season .
the elevators look to have steadied the ship that - until coach peter neururer took charge - had a habit of going up and down as often as their supporters ' heart rates .
two draws and four goals so far hardly inspire championship aspirations , but a good result against arminia bielefeld in week three will take bochum closer to the summit . bielefeld have been rested after their game against hannover was again postponed and will be looking not only for their first win but also their first goals in the bundesliga this season after an opening 0-0 draw with borussia mönchengladbach . freiburg looking to build on late win freiburg will be looking to build on their 1-0 victory over wolfsburg with more of the same against borussia mönchengladbach .
regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute in their last game , and the newly promoted side will want to settle nerves a little quicker this time around .
freiburg 's first away win since they defeated borussia dortmund 1-2 in october 2001 will surely have given them confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian ziege mönchengladbach is another team which can count itself unlucky to have lost its last game .
mönchengladbach were twice in the lead against borussia dortmund in the thriller at the newly opened borussia park stadium in week two , only to eventually lose 3-2 .

they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .

hamburg can be excused for sulking at the foot of the table .
after being soundly beaten by bayern munich in week one , the hamburgers were unlucky to lose 2-1 away at mainz the following week .
daniel van buyten 's opening goal seemed to have turned hamburg 's luck , but defensive frailties and confusion were once again exposed and antonio da silva punished them , not once but twice , to give the newcomers victory .
hamburg will want to stop the slide in the coming game . bayer leverkusen remain unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings after drawing 2-2 with bochum last time out .
leverkusen left it late to achieve parity in the ruhrstadion , relying on ukrainian andrej voronin 's 87th minute equalizer to save the day after going 2-1 down .
they could have joined champions werder bremen at the top of the table if they had beaten bochum but instead remain in fifth place , hoping to grab the top slot in week three against the team just above them , bayern munich . bayern look for return of creative spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler and kovac in a friendlier moment .
bayern will hope for a more composed performance after laboring against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium in week two .
the bavarian giants spent most of the game literally battling with berlin in the hard fought 1-1 draw and will be looking for finesse rather than a fight this time out .
felix magath will also hope that his fourth-placed team will not be so profligate in front of goal and that sebastian deisler will remember he plays soccer rather than rugby , forgoing the massive punts up field for the delicate touch he is renowned for . goals by vratislav lokvenc and christoph preuss against bayer leverkusen give bochum renewed faith in their ability to maintain their top flight status for another season .
the elevators look to have steadied the ship that - until coach peter neururer took charge - had a habit of going up and down as often as their supporters ' heart rates .

hamburg can be excused for sulking at the foot of the table .
after being soundly beaten by bayern munich in week one , the hamburgers were unlucky to lose 2-1 away at mainz the following week .
daniel van buyten 's opening goal seemed to have turned hamburg 's luck , but defensive frailties and confusion were once again exposed and antonio da silva punished them , not once but twice , to give the newcomers victory .
hamburg will want to stop the slide in the coming game . bayer leverkusen remain unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings after drawing 2-2 with bochum last time out .
leverkusen left it late to achieve parity in the ruhrstadion , relying on ukrainian andrej voronin 's 87th minute equalizer to save the day after going 2-1 down .
they could have joined champions werder bremen at the top of the table if they had beaten bochum but instead remain in fifth place , hoping to grab the top slot in week three against the team just above them , bayern munich . bayern look for return of creative spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler and kovac in a friendlier moment .
bayern will hope for a more composed performance after laboring against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium in week two .
the bavarian giants spent most of the game literally battling with berlin in the hard fought 1-1 draw and will be looking for finesse rather than a fight this time out .
felix magath will also hope that his fourth-placed team will not be so profligate in front of goal and that sebastian deisler will remember he plays soccer rather than rugby , forgoing the massive punts up field for the delicate touch he is renowned for . goals by vratislav lokvenc and christoph preuss against bayer leverkusen give bochum renewed faith in their ability to maintain their top flight status for another season .
the elevators look to have steadied the ship that - until coach peter neururer took charge - had a habit of going up and down as often as their supporters ' heart rates .
two draws and four goals so far hardly inspire championship aspirations , but a good result against arminia bielefeld in week three will take bochum closer to the summit . bielefeld have been rested after their game against hannover was again postponed and will be looking not only for their first win but also their first goals in the bundesliga this season after an opening 0-0 draw with borussia mönchengladbach . freiburg looking to build on late win freiburg will be looking to build on their 1-0 victory over wolfsburg with more of the same against borussia mönchengladbach .
regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute in their last game , and the newly promoted side will want to settle nerves a little quicker this time around .
freiburg 's first away win since they defeated borussia dortmund 1-2 in october 2001 will surely have given them confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian ziege mönchengladbach is another team which can count itself unlucky to have lost its last game .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .

hamburg can be excused for sulking at the foot of the table .
after being soundly beaten by bayern munich in week one , the hamburgers were unlucky to lose 2-1 away at mainz the following week .
daniel van buyten 's opening goal seemed to have turned hamburg 's luck , but defensive frailties and confusion were once again exposed and antonio da silva punished them , not once but twice , to give the newcomers victory .
hamburg will want to stop the slide in the coming game . bayer leverkusen remain unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings after drawing 2-2 with bochum last time out .
leverkusen left it late to achieve parity in the ruhrstadion , relying on ukrainian andrej voronin 's 87th minute equalizer to save the day after going 2-1 down .
they could have joined champions werder bremen at the top of the table if they had beaten bochum but instead remain in fifth place , hoping to grab the top slot in week three against the team just above them , bayern munich . bayern look for return of creative spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler and kovac in a friendlier moment .
bayern will hope for a more composed performance after laboring against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium in week two .
the bavarian giants spent most of the game literally battling with berlin in the hard fought 1-1 draw and will be looking for finesse rather than a fight this time out .
felix magath will also hope that his fourth-placed team will not be so profligate in front of goal and that sebastian deisler will remember he plays soccer rather than rugby , forgoing the massive punts up field for the delicate touch he is renowned for . goals by vratislav lokvenc and christoph preuss against bayer leverkusen give bochum renewed faith in their ability to maintain their top flight status for another season .
the elevators look to have steadied the ship that - until coach peter neururer took charge - had a habit of going up and down as often as their supporters ' heart rates .
two draws and four goals so far hardly inspire championship aspirations , but a good result against arminia bielefeld in week three will take bochum closer to the summit . bielefeld have been rested after their game against hannover was again postponed and will be looking not only for their first win but also their first goals in the bundesliga this season after an opening 0-0 draw with borussia mönchengladbach . freiburg looking to build on late win freiburg will be looking to build on their 1-0 victory over wolfsburg with more of the same against borussia mönchengladbach .
regis dorn snatched victory for freiburg in the 85th minute in their last game , and the newly promoted side will want to settle nerves a little quicker this time around .
freiburg 's first away win since they defeated borussia dortmund 1-2 in october 2001 will surely have given them confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian ziege mönchengladbach is another team which can count itself unlucky to have lost its last game .
mönchengladbach were twice in the lead against borussia dortmund in the thriller at the newly opened borussia park stadium in week two , only to eventually lose 3-2 .
ivo ulich 's smart goal from a christian ziege cross and markus hausweiler 's thunderous shot were quality strikes but ultimately not enough .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .
nuremberg remain in the top five with a win and a draw and look forward to remaining there with a good result against bottom club hamburg . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season . dw-tv europe live european journal - the magazine from brussels we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .

happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .

only a day before , the latest in a month long campaign of " monday demonstrations , " as many as 70,000 people once again took to the streets to show exactly what they thought of the government 's plans . the citizens of the east , the region that stands to be affected most by the reforms to cut unemployment benefit among other things , made up most of those who marched .
on tuesday , with the chancellor within striking distance , the protests took a more malevolent turn . whistles and abuse greet schröder during the chancellor 's official speech to mark the prelude of the social democrat 's state election campaign in saxony , schröder was drowned out by whistles , songs and shouts of defamatory abuse as he defended the hartz iv job market reforms .
the chancellor reacted angrily to cries of " betrayer of the working class , " responding by labeling those attempting to shout him down as undemocratic and accusing them of wanting the " destruction of the political culture . " in a television interview that evening with regional broadcaster mdr , schröder said that he could handle protests , even if they were violent , but added that he would not accept the incitement of hatred and the spread of disinformation by radical groups and opposition parties .
" on one side , there is the legitimate fear of what is to come , " schröder said .
" but on the other , there is the fear produced by right-wing radical groups and the -lrb- former communist party -rrb- pds . " eggs fly at wittenburg it had been a long and stressful day for the chancellor .
while visiting a newly renovated train station in wittenberg , schröder narrowly avoided what initial reports described as " a hail of eggs " thrown by protestors livid over the planned labor-market reforms .
what was later reported as " one or two " eggs missed the chancellor but hit journalists traveling with him .

separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .

separately , an independent us report also blamed top-level pentagon officials for the scandal . the pre-trial hearings of four us soldiers accused of mistreating iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad concluded at a us military base in mannheim , germany on tuesday .
on the second day of the two-day hearings the spotlight was on whether the soldiers ' superiors in the us army were jointly responsible for the abuses that have sparked worldwide anger and condemnation . the lawyers for the soldiers accuse the us military leadership of ordering the abuses and torture in order to soften the iraqi detainees and make them more willing to talk during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a courtroom drawing shows specialist charles graner , right , with his lawyers .
the lawyer for one of the soldiers , specialist charles graner , said on tuesday that the us soldiers at abu ghraib were simply following orders and that making prison inmates strip naked and humiliating them were widely used interrogation methods . " the us government must admit that the military intelligence agency , the cia and others ordered the soldiers to do these things , " he said .
" there are photographs where these intelligence officers are seen .
there is no doubt that high-ranking military officers and cia agents knew what was happening and even ordered it themselves . " high-level military officers to the stand chief prosecutor major michael holly told the court two low-ranking soldiers from a military intelligence unit who " we believe are co-conspirators " would probably be charged soon . us military judge james pohl said on tuesday that he wanted to call high-ranking us military officials and key intelligence officers to testify unless the us government charges them .
he however refused to order us defense secretary donald rumsfeld to talk to lawyers about prisoner interrogation policy . earlier judge pohl also condemned the delays and slow pace of us government investigations into the abu ghraib prison abuse scandal . guilty as charged on tuesday , staff sergeant ivan frederick , the highest-ranking us soldier accused of abusing prisoners , acknowledged his role in the scandal . his lawyer , gary meyers said frederick had decided to do the " honest and dignified thing " and hoped others among the accused would step forward too .
" he 's taking responsibility for certain acts , " meyers said , adding that an agreement had been reached with prosecutors to drop other charges against him at a hearing on october 20 in baghdad . frederick is charged with maltreating detainees , conspiracy to maltreat detainees , dereliction of duty and committing an indecent act . " chaos at abu ghraib " separately , an independent commission in washington probing the abu ghraib prison scandal presented a damning indictment of the pentagon 's role in the affair . while the blame mainly lies with the american soldiers who ran the notorious jail , senior commanders and top-level pentagon officials including rumsfeld can be faulted for failed leadership and oversight , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american soldiers stand behind a pyramid of naked iraqi prisoners at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad , iraq .
" there was chaos at abu ghraib , " james schlesinger , a former secretary of defense who headed the four-member commission appointed by rumsfeld , said .
the schlesinger report contradicted the bush administration 's assertion that the abuses were only perpetrated by a handful of soldiers acting on their own . it points a direct finger at lieutenant general ricardo sanchez , the top us commander in iraq in january , but counters that the scope of the affair was n't just limited to sanchez ' unit running the prison . " there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulagated by senior officials or military authorities , " the report said .
" still , the abuses were not just the failure of some individuals to follow known standards , and they are more than the failure of a few leaders to enforce proper discipline .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency ministry soldier inspects debris of russian tu-134 , which crushed near the village of buchalki in the tula region early wednesday morning .
afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .
meanwhile , emergency personnel said they had recovered dozens of bodies at both crash sites and were transporting remains to local morgues .
the interfax news agency said debris from the plane that hit the ground near rostov was scattered over fields and forests along a 10-kilometer -lrb- 6.2-mile -rrb- trajectory . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency ministry soldier inspects debris of russian tu-134 , which crushed near the village of buchalki in the tula region early wednesday morning .
afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .
meanwhile , emergency personnel said they had recovered dozens of bodies at both crash sites and were transporting remains to local morgues .
the interfax news agency said debris from the plane that hit the ground near rostov was scattered over fields and forests along a 10-kilometer -lrb- 6.2-mile -rrb- trajectory . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .

but berlin his taken his name off the labor reforms he penned , fearing germans will confuse hartz with " hard . " for most germans , hartz iv evokes the word hart -lrb- " hard " -rrb- . that was the government 's logic when spokesman bela anda announced in berlin on monday that the package of labor market reforms currently provoking massive demonstrations acroos the country would be called " reforms on the labor market " from now on .
that 's not likely to bother the father of the reforms , peter hartz , though .
after having announced a wage freeze for employees at carmaker volkswagen 's german plants on monday , the human resources chief is likely to be more concerned with avoiding a labor dispute . hartz has been known internationally for his innovative human resources and labor market policies as a member of volkswagen 's executive board since the early 1990s .
the broader public only became aware of him in 2002 with his slogan " 5,000 times 5,000 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen created 5,000 jobs for the manufacture of its touran minivan .
hartz 's idea , which was successfully implemented , called for volkswagen to employ a flexible occupational plan to produce the minivan touran at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
five thousand previously jobless workers were paid 5,000 deutsche marks -lrb- € 2,556 / $ 3,088 -rrb- a month to manufacture the vehicle .
hartz showed that modern manufacturing procedures , new distribution routes and innovative training programs could be used to produce internationally successful and competitive cars .
in the political arena hartz 's achievement was the beginning of his career in the political arena .
the social democrat became a member of a commission of experts engaged by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to draft plans for reforming the german federal labor agency .
hartz was sober about the task . " we wo n't get the gift of the great miracle with the hundreds of thousands of jobs , " hartz said at the time .
" rather , we will only reach it with an ant 's strategy in which we see to one job after another , in which we look at competitive and marketable products and services .
for that we need resources , for that we need an infrastructure . " the 61-year-old , an economist from the western german state saarland , has worked as a top manager for numerous companies .
at volkswagen , hartz attracted attention with another innovation : the four-day work week in what he dubbed the " breathing company . "
the idea was to cut work hours and pay to avoid massive layoffs .
ambitious aims hartz 's experiences catapulted him once again onto a commission charged with designing reforms for schröder 's government .
shortly before german parliamentary elections , on august 16 , 2002 , hartz announced the results of the body named after him and its ambitious goal of creating jobs for millions of unemployed people . " we have come to the conclusion that it is feasible , -lrb- to create -rrb- 2 million jobless in three years ... if we fulfill certain requirements , " he said . the hartz commission came up with a whole series of measures to fight mass unemployment in germany .
job centers and personal service agencies were devised to better help the unemployed find work .
programs like the so-called " mini jobs , " tax-free employment for up to € 400 , and " ich ags , " subsidies for those who take the plunge into self-employment , are meant to ease entry into the working world and independence . but the real feat came only later : hartz iv fused unemployment and welfare benefits , bringing the former down to the level of the latter .
approval of the law from both chambers of parliament was a show of strength and an important achievement for peter hartz . " ideas are only as good as their implementation , " hartz said .
" and that 's good , because we 've come a good bit further today .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .

but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .
i myself had gotten involved in the war and lost many friends .
however , i feel no hatred to the germans .
if this can provide a message to the young generation , then it is a great thing .

it 's just another example of the lack of concept plaguing the west 's afghanistan policy . if nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer is right in his estimation that the deployment in afghanistan is a crucial measure of the sustainability of the military alliance , then things do n't look too good . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai that was apparent even at the nato summit in istanbul at the end of june and it is becoming painfully clearer .
everyone agreed in istanbul that the number of soldiers in afghanistan had to be massively increased in order to secure presidential elections in the country on oct .
9 .
afghan president hamid karzai was promised 3,500 soldiers - significantly less than the number the president had requested . at the time , the key question of who would provide the extra soldiers remained open .
since only italy and spain have made corresponding promises since , just 1,800 extra soldiers have been provided . where are the prts ? it 's the same picture when it comes to the provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prt -rrb- that are meant to protect and support civilian and development projects in afghanistan .
before the nato summit , there was talk of a far-reaching network of such prts in northern and western afghanistan .
germany , britain , italy , spain , turkey and the netherlands were meant to provide the necessary military forces . but the italians , spanish and turks made it clear in istanbul that they were n't prepared to do that .
the result was a vague decision : four new teams would be built , but the question of who would provide them , was left wide open again . after the summit it was time for some glossing over : an existing british team was meant to be shortly placed under nato command .
and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .
and if all that was n't bad enough , the opium trade has been enjoying an unimagined boom since the end of the taliban regime .
opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .
a complete pull-out , which opposition politicians in germany are advocating , would be the worst alternative .
civil war , a further boost to the drug trade and the revival of rich breeding ground for international terrorism , would be the inevitable consequences .
nobody could really want that . that 's why what 's crucially needed are more , and not less , soldiers and in all regions of the country with a significantly wider mandate .
and as far as nato 's sustainability goes : the strength of the alliance is not just measured by its military capabilities , but also on the basis of the capacity to match inadequate plans to real needs . or at least to the willingness of its members , to honor and implement decisions that have been taken jointly .
in the case of afghanistan , this means sending more soldiers immediately . felix steiner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack raises questions over german presence in kunduz a bomb attack in the northern afghan province of kunduz that appears to have targeted a car belonging to german-led peacekeepers has opposition politicians in germany questioning the strategy for stabilizing the region .

and germany said it would upgrade the planned faizabad outpost of the existing prt in kunduz to a " new " reconstruction team - but only if it was supported by other smaller nato members states . after the deployment of 100 additional german soldiers in faizabad was announced , first for the end of july and then for mid-august , german defense minister peter struck was forced to make an admission : the german soldiers , who would be transferred in september , would remain alone in faizabad .
berlin 's pleas for help remained unheeded . doubters believe afghanistan too far gone apparently several nato states are n't convinced anymore that troop deployment in afghanistan makes sense - there 's no other explanation for their refusal to send soldiers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poppy farmer mohammad agha inspects his crop in the small village of essazai kili 15km south of lashkar gah , afghanistan .
the doubters have enough arguments : even after two and a half years , afghanistan is still miles away from real stability .
president hamid karzai 's power is limited solely to the capital of kabul ; it 's the warlords who still pull the strings in the provinces .
the disarmament of militia has stalled and remains far behind the envisioned targets .
and if all that was n't bad enough , the opium trade has been enjoying an unimagined boom since the end of the taliban regime .
opium that , in particular , sustains drug addicts in europe . but the battle against the warlords and the drug trade is explicitly not the responsibility of nato in afghanistan - for fear of being sucked into incalculable conflicts . and so - cynical as it might sound - the next poppy crop in faizabad , one of the most important agricultural regions in afghanistan , will probably be harvested under the eyes and protection of german soldiers .
does it make sense to risk the life and health of soldiers for that ? more soldiers needed what 's true is that with nato 's present deployment concept , afghanistan will languish in its current instable condition for a long time to come .
a complete pull-out , which opposition politicians in germany are advocating , would be the worst alternative .
civil war , a further boost to the drug trade and the revival of rich breeding ground for international terrorism , would be the inevitable consequences .
nobody could really want that . that 's why what 's crucially needed are more , and not less , soldiers and in all regions of the country with a significantly wider mandate .
and as far as nato 's sustainability goes : the strength of the alliance is not just measured by its military capabilities , but also on the basis of the capacity to match inadequate plans to real needs . or at least to the willingness of its members , to honor and implement decisions that have been taken jointly .
in the case of afghanistan , this means sending more soldiers immediately . felix steiner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack raises questions over german presence in kunduz a bomb attack in the northern afghan province of kunduz that appears to have targeted a car belonging to german-led peacekeepers has opposition politicians in germany questioning the strategy for stabilizing the region .

she told deutsche welle about her experiences in paris in the weeks leading up to the liberation of the french capital by allied forces on august 25 , 1944 .
paris had been under the nazi boot for four years by mid-1944 and many parisians were at the point of starvation .
germany 's occupation of france had left the inhabitants of the capital without many bare essentials including bread and butter .
it was a common sight to see parisians cooking meals on campfires in the streets due to the lack of coal , electricity or gas in the city .
it is estimated that the average parisian lost 44 pounds under the nazi occupation , which began on june 14 , 1940 .
in those dire times , it was not unusual to see the once overflowing balconies devoid of greenery and blooms , replaced by rabbit hutches housing the prime ingredient for a coveted and potentially life-saving stew .
burning spirit to fight fed by hardship paris was a desperate city by the summer of 1944 , full of exhausted and near-starving people but one where the undercurrent of hatred and revenge found citizens willing to embrace these emotions and use them as their own fuel in the fight for their country .
" paris was starving , without lights , without bread , without clothes , " recalled madeleine riffaud .
the effect of the occupation on this young woman , just 17 at the time , was to radicalize riffaud and steel her for the fight to come .
taking the codename " rainer , " riffaud joined the 20,000 strong résistance in the french capital and became one of the 100,000 or so members nationwide .
" i took the name of a german , out of respect for the author rainer maria rilke , whose poems i loved .
we were at war with the nazis , not at war against the german people .
so i became ' rainer ' and remained so to the end of the occupation . " non-combat role led to involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians scatter for cover on august 26 , 1944 as a german sniper opens fire on people celebrating the arrival of allied troops .
riffaud began her life as a résistance fighter in the unspectacular but important role of a messenger and deliverer of food to the combat members of the movement .
but all this was to change on june 10 , 1944 .
on that day , in the central french village of oradour sur glane , members of the german ss massacred 600 villagers , many of whom were friends of the riffaud family . " in paris , the losses had been so heavy that barely any armed action took place .
they needed new fighters and after this killing , i was ready to fight . "
the feeling was spreading .
a city down on its knees could feel the tide turning .
the allies had landed on the mainland on june 6 , a source of hope and a clarion call for parisians to rise up , which they did .
on july 14 , nine days before riffaud took her own dramatic steps into the war effort , 100,000 people rallied in the streets , some singing the " marseillaise , " france 's national anthem .
for the first time , french police did not intervene .
a young girl showed her mettle on july 23 , riffaud volunteered to kill a nazi to avenge the deaths and " to show parisians you can kill the occupier in broad daylight at 3 o 'clock on a sunday afternoon . "
" i went past a bridge .
a german soldier stood there alone .
the others were further away .
i went near on my bicycle .
i waited until the man turned to me .
i did not want to shoot him in the back .
when he looked at me , i shot him twice in the head .
he fell without sound , without a word .
i had killed him instantly .
i did not want him to suffer .
the passers-by clapped .
they celebrated that a young girl could muster the courage to kill a member of the occupying forces . " seconds later , riffaud was arrested .
she spent several weeks in gestapo custody where she was tortured but gave away no information about the group she worked with .
then , on august 24 , allied tanks began rolling into paris after a three month push from the beaches of normandy .
riffaud was released and stepped out into a free paris . " from the police loudspeakers , the news came : paris is free .
we have won !
no more shooting .
the ss were everywhere , waving white flags , and the people were flowing out on the streets . " a day later , on august 25 , church bells tolled across paris .
the city was liberated . a lesson to learn " today , germany and france are part of an alliance which builds a europe together .
but , nevertheless , the children must know about the past and what people like us had to do .
i myself had gotten involved in the war and lost many friends .
however , i feel no hatred to the germans .

a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "

it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "

a new study commissioned in berlin and released on wednesday concluded that the fight against international terrorism should offer no justification whatsoever for the infringement of basic human rights . unfortunately practice and reality are often two very different things , and the report by the german institute for human rights concluded that human rights violations have been the order of the day in many parts of the world following successive rounds of attacks by al qaeda and other terrorist groups .
most troubling , the study noted , is that democratic western nations have also been ignoring human rights .
the abu ghraib prison in iraq and the facility at guantanamo where suspected al qaeda and taliban members are being held are just two examples , the document argued , of an anti-terror fight that has spun out of control .
" humans rights are bound to get in trouble when it comes to the fight against terrorism , " said the study 's co-author , wolfgang heinz , " because the overarching goal to get information from suspected terrorists , and often states only talk about ' terrorists ' without any charge , without any trial is the central concern of states and of security agencies . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuffed at the ankle and chained to a door handle at abu ghraib the institute report spoke of zones of lawlessness which had developed in the fight against international terrorism after sept .
11 , 2001 .
it called on the german government to issue stricter guidelines for future anti-terror missions abroad with the involvement of special forces units .
among those guidelines would be a requirement that bundeswehr soldiers report any human rights violations they see while working on anti-terrorism missions .
us investigation of abu grhaib abuses ' half-hearted ' the study also accused the bush administration of taking a half-hearted approach in its investigation of torture at abu grhaib .
it also said the role of cia and private security agents in the scandal has never been seriously scrutinized and called for the creation of an internationally binding system of registration for prisoners .
the study also argued that secret detention centers should completely eliminated .
" some rules have to be clear , and in the case of germany , i 've learned from our minister of justice , for example , that people would not be turned over to the united states if there is not a guarantee , no. 1 , that the death penalty is not going to be used against these people and , no. 2 , that people should not be sent to guantanamo . "
report calls for strict international mandates heinz also argued that germany should stick to its policy of only getting involved in anti-terror missions if they are mandated by the united nations .
he described anti-terror coalitions with non-democratic nations such as pakistan and uzbekistan as potentially problematic , because these countries have poor human rights records .
on the other hand , he said , such coalitions could secure greater influence on how human rights issues are resolved in those nations .
" it 's important to define the rules according to which countries which clearly are more democratic and want to remain democratic , cooperate with non-democratic countries or even dictatorship , " heinz said .
" very often in practice , i would expect , there is some exchange between the police agencies and perhaps even security agencies because often these are the same countries in which terrorist activities develop , so there is a necessity that i would accept . "

hamburg can be excused for sulking at the foot of the table .
after being soundly beaten by bayern munich in week one , the hamburgers were unlucky to lose 2-1 away at mainz the following week .
daniel van buyten 's opening goal seemed to have turned hamburg 's luck , but defensive frailties and confusion were once again exposed and antonio da silva punished them , not once but twice , to give the newcomers victory .
hamburg will want to stop the slide in the coming game . bayer leverkusen remain unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings after drawing 2-2 with bochum last time out .
leverkusen left it late to achieve parity in the ruhrstadion , relying on ukrainian andrej voronin 's 87th minute equalizer to save the day after going 2-1 down .
they could have joined champions werder bremen at the top of the table if they had beaten bochum but instead remain in fifth place , hoping to grab the top slot in week three against the team just above them , bayern munich . bayern look for return of creative spark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler and kovac in a friendlier moment .
bayern will hope for a more composed performance after laboring against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium in week two .
the bavarian giants spent most of the game literally battling with berlin in the hard fought 1-1 draw and will be looking for finesse rather than a fight this time out .
felix magath will also hope that his fourth-placed team will not be so profligate in front of goal and that sebastian deisler will remember he plays soccer rather than rugby , forgoing the massive punts up field for the delicate touch he is renowned for . goals by vratislav lokvenc and christoph preuss against bayer leverkusen give bochum renewed faith in their ability to maintain their top flight status for another season .
the elevators look to have steadied the ship that - until coach peter neururer took charge - had a habit of going up and down as often as their supporters ' heart rates .
two draws and four goals so far hardly inspire championship aspirations , but a good result against arminia bielefeld in week three will take bochum closer to the summit . bielefeld have been rested after their game against hannover was again postponed and will be looking not only for their first win but also their first goals in the bundesliga this season after an opening 0-0 draw with borussia mönchengladbach . freiburg looking to build on late win freiburg will be looking to build on their 1-0 victory over wolfsburg with more of the same against borussia mönchengladbach .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .
nuremberg remain in the top five with a win and a draw and look forward to remaining there with a good result against bottom club hamburg . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .
nuremberg remain in the top five with a win and a draw and look forward to remaining there with a good result against bottom club hamburg . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official website of the bundesliga comprehensive information concerning the 2004/2005 bundesliga season .

the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .
expect a few personnel changes at hansa before the schalke game . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho hertha berlin showed that they could play against the big guns and frustrate their opponents into playing the game their way in their second match .
against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .
behind twice in the match , dortmund recovered to plunder an away win . hannover goes to the westfalen stadium , after having the week two game against arminia bielefeld put back until september .
in the wake of a 2-1 defeat on the opening day of the season against bayer leverkusen , hannover fans will hope the extended break from play has given their team brighter ideas . stuttgart without hero-turned-villain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeronimo cacau of vfb stuttgart early league leaders stuttgart stuttered against surprising second-placers nuremberg in their last game , despite taking the lead through week one 's hat-trick hero cacau .
the brazilian promptly became week two 's villain and subsequently week three 's casualty as he is suspended for the game against second-from-bottom side kaiserslautern .
stuttgart coach matthias sammer will be looking for more life from his team after shutting up shop early in the second half and running the clock down after being pegged back to 1-1 by nuremberg . stuttgart should look to restart their flying challenge with a comprehensive performance in their next game , while kaiserslautern are still looking for their first win and will feel aggrieved that it did n't come in their last game against schalke .
jochen seitz opened his account by scoring after a through ball from club newcomer carsten jancker only to see his team fall victim to a better-organized side in the royal blues . nuremberg continue their bundesliga adventure in the upper echelons thanks in part to croat ivica banovic 's equalizer against 10-man stuttgart in the northerner 's last game .

after being soundly beaten by bayern munich in week one , the hamburgers were unlucky to lose 2-1 away at mainz the following week .
daniel van buyten 's opening goal seemed to have turned hamburg 's luck , but defensive frailties and confusion were once again exposed and antonio da silva punished them , not once but twice , to give the newcomers victory .
hamburg will want to stop the slide in the coming game . bayer leverkusen remain unbeaten in 13 bundesliga outings after drawing 2-2 with bochum last time out .

bayern will hope for a more composed performance after laboring against a determined and physical hertha berlin side in the olympic stadium in week two .

here 's a preview of all the coming games in week three as others plot to close the gap . after the international friendlies disrupted the rhythm of leagues all over europe , many of which were barely a week old , competitive league soccer gets underway again .
the bundesliga enters week three with the majority of international stars back with their clubs and ready to compete once more as germany 's premier soccer league once again prepares for action on the weekend august 28/29 . champions werder bremen will be looking to extend their winning ways after thrashing hansa rostock 0-4 in northern germany to secure the biggest win of week two and maintain a 100 percent record in the league so far .
bremen , top of the table on six points after two matches , take on wolfsburg who will want to improve their luck after an attacking display against mainz went unrewarded .
the wolves struck the woodwork twice and ended their week two game as 1-0 losers . their first game victory should not be a too distant memory and thomas brdaric will be buoyed by another germany call-up in mid-week and will be looking to avoid the frame and find the net against the champions . new boy ailton humbled by asamoah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schalke 's first win of the season against kaiserslautern in week two brought some relief to the start of a jittery campaign , there is still some unrest in the gelsenkirchen camp .
new striker ailton has apparently spat the dummy over criticism he has received over his performances for his new club , angering his new boss and ending a short-lived honeymoon period after his switch from bremen .
happily though , a trusted old friend seems to be enjoying himself again . two goals from gerald asamoah will give schalke cause for optimism against rostock , the germany striker scoring in each half in the 2-1 win against kaiserslautern .
schalke 's opponents will be wary of any team with a prolific striker in their midst , after feeling the full force of bremen 's attacking prowess in the 4-0 defeat in week two .

against bayern munich , the early goal by brazilian marcelinho was followed up by almost otto rehhagel-like defensive tactics that caused bayern to shoot from distance and scrap tooth and nail for every ball in the final third of the pitch . greek tactics could be a tragedy in waiting berlin will have to be aware , however , that defending a one-goal lead for 75 minutes against quality opposition can be risky , as shown by the amount of munich pressure that followed the break .
they may not face such stiff competition from mainz , but fresh from taking the scalp of hamburg in a well-fought 2-1 victory , the bundesliga virgin may just have the gall to find a way through the greece style set up at hertha . dortmund 's season finally sparked into life after what seemed to be the start of a long and painful drop into another campaign of ignominy .
good news from the mönchengladbach victory will be the emergence of danish newcomer niclas jensen as a goal scorer and the first goals for jan koller and brazilian ewerthon this season .
the manner of the victory in week two will also fill the bvb faithful with optimism .

chechen leader 's death creates power vacuum europe -pipe- 25.08.2004 89 dead in russian crashes , terror probed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian emergency workers comb the fields searching for bodies two passenger jets crashed simultaneously in different places after taking off from the same moscow airport , leaving 89 people dead and raising fears anew wednesday of terrorism in the heart of russia . the planes departed within about an hour of each other late tuesday bound for destinations in southern russia and went down at almost precisely the same moment 770 kilometers -lrb- 480 miles -rrb- apart in two regions south of the russian capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wreckage and bodies lay strewn across fields outside the central city of tula and the southern city of rostov-on-don as hundreds of emergency workers used cranes to sift through the detritus and extract corpses .
officials were at a loss to explain how the planes went down with such improbably coincidental timing and said the possibility that the crashes resulted from terrorist attacks was being " carefully studied " along with other theories .
there were however no claims of responsibility for the twin disasters and investigators also indicated that they were looking at other possible explanations including bad weather , pilot error and problems with the fuel pumped into the jets .
" the hypothesis of a terrorist act is being carefully studied " by experts from the fsb intelligence service and other government agencies , fsb spokesman sergei ignachenko told afp .
russian security agencies were already on heightened alert ahead of elections sunday in the war-torn republic of chechnya that some breakaway rebel groups have vowed to thwart with violence if needed .
putin : we will investigate without delay president vladimir putin , in a statement transmitted by russian media , ordered security agencies to investigate the crashes " without delay " but there was little official comment on the crashes apart from death toll updates .
russian media reported that the planes were carrying a total of 90 passengers and crew .
that figure however was later revised to 89 after authorities published figures indicating one plane had 46 people aboard and the other 43 .
grief-stricken relatives and friends of the passengers on the plane converged on domodedovo airport where authorities said they would provide information updates and psychological assistance .
the " black box " flight data recorders from both aircraft were recovered and russian news agencies reported that one of the planes had issued a distress signal before plummeting to the ground .

afp reporters at the crash site outside tula spoke to witnesses who claimed to have heard an explosion as the plane passed over the city , but their accounts offered little in the way of explaining how the plane went down .
heightened security meanwhile , authorities in moscow announced that precautionary steps were being taken to tighten security at the city 's airports and other public sites with the participation of the fsb and other government agencies .
" all of the security services have been instructed to step up their vigilance , " moscow government spokesman kirill mazulin said , according to interfax news agency .
an increased presence of police officers and other security personnel in public transportation stations and around many government buildings had already been in evidence over the past week .
a number of large public events , including a " moscow city day " celebration , were scheduled to be held in the capital in the coming days and security forces were carrying out frequent spot identification checks of people on the streets .
the heightened security in the capital and elsewhere reflected official concern that the vote in chechnya , an election the kremlin seeks to hold up as a sign of democratic progress in the embattled republic , not be disrupted in any way .
chechen rebel denies attack on airliners one key chechen separatist leader , aslan maskhadov , has claimed responsibility for recent attacks on russian soil and has vowed to sustain violent opposition to moscow 's political objectives for chechnya .
a spokesman for maskhadov however flatly denied the rebel leader had any connection to the plane crashes .
chechen rebels or their supporters have been blamed for two major bomb attacks in moscow this year , one that occurred in the subway during morning rush hour and another on a busy public sidewalk across the street from the kremlin walls .
on tuesday , four people were injured in a bomb blast at a bus station on the outskirts of moscow .
no one has claimed responsibility for that blast .
meanwhile , emergency personnel said they had recovered dozens of bodies at both crash sites and were transporting remains to local morgues .

only a day before , the latest in a month long campaign of " monday demonstrations , " as many as 70,000 people once again took to the streets to show exactly what they thought of the government 's plans . the citizens of the east , the region that stands to be affected most by the reforms to cut unemployment benefit among other things , made up most of those who marched .
on tuesday , with the chancellor within striking distance , the protests took a more malevolent turn . whistles and abuse greet schröder during the chancellor 's official speech to mark the prelude of the social democrat 's state election campaign in saxony , schröder was drowned out by whistles , songs and shouts of defamatory abuse as he defended the hartz iv job market reforms .
the chancellor reacted angrily to cries of " betrayer of the working class , " responding by labeling those attempting to shout him down as undemocratic and accusing them of wanting the " destruction of the political culture . " in a television interview that evening with regional broadcaster mdr , schröder said that he could handle protests , even if they were violent , but added that he would not accept the incitement of hatred and the spread of disinformation by radical groups and opposition parties .
" on one side , there is the legitimate fear of what is to come , " schröder said .
" but on the other , there is the fear produced by right-wing radical groups and the -lrb- former communist party -rrb- pds . " eggs fly at wittenburg it had been a long and stressful day for the chancellor .
while visiting a newly renovated train station in wittenberg , schröder narrowly avoided what initial reports described as " a hail of eggs " thrown by protestors livid over the planned labor-market reforms .
what was later reported as " one or two " eggs missed the chancellor but hit journalists traveling with him .

british gas announced the cost of gas will rise by 12.4 % , while the price of electricity will go up by 9.4 % .
energywatch said next month 's increases were " a body blow to consumers " .
" this price rise is going to add millions to bills and expose many thousands of households to the risk of fuel poverty , " said boss allan asher .
british gas has acknowledged that some customers may struggle to cope with the increase , which it blames on the rising wholesale cost of gas , and has set aside £ 10m to protect vulnerable customers .
however , it is unclear how this money will be distributed . "
our message to british gas customers is to shop around and get yourself a better deal " industry regulator ofgem energywatch gave the fund a cautious welcome , but said overall it was " seriously bad news for millions of consumers " .
" it is no surprise that british gas have responded to the rising wholesale cost of gas , but it is by no means clear why the wholesale price is so high , " mr asher said .
he added that energywatch would be calling for an investigation into the wholesale market .
industry regulator ofgem also criticised the increase , and urged british gas customers to change supplier , saying there were " no prizes for loyalty " .
" our message to british gas customers is to shop around and get yourself a better deal , " a spokesman told bbc news online .
however , ofgem itself was criticised by former energy minister brian wilson .
he said the latest price increases demanded an urgent rethink of britain 's proposed reliance on imported gas and the role of ofgem .
impact on average bill * gas paid quarterly : £ 422 a year to £ 474 a year gas paid by direct debit : £ 378 a year to £ 425 a year electricity paid quarterly : £ 257 a year to £ 281 a year electricity paid by direct debit : £ 245 a year to £ 268 a year prepayment gas : £ 422 a year to £ 474 a year prepayment electricity : £ 273 a year to £ 299 a year * average usage and prices include vat .
source : british gas " both within government and subsequently , i have been warning about the extreme short-termism of the policies being pursued by ofgem . "
the new prices come after british gas put up prices for its 6.2 million electricity customers and 18.4 million gas customers in january , when it added an extra 5.9 % to customers ' bills .
the latest increases take effect from 20 september and are expected to add an extra £ 52 a year to a typical gas bill , which is paid quarterly .
the cost of wholesale gas has risen sharply in the past year , partly as a result of higher crude oil prices .
competition for electricity , the new prices are expected to add an average of £ 24 a year to a typical bill , paid quarterly , or £ 26 a year for customers who pay by a prepayment meter .
there are six major gas and electricity suppliers and a range of smaller suppliers which disgruntled british gas customers could switch to .
powergen has already increased its prices twice this year and the other gas and electricity suppliers are expected to follow suit .
" historically ... when british gas puts up its prices , the other suppliers tend to follow suit , " said jenny evans , spokesman for energy comparison website uswitch.com.
" but while wholesale gas prices have increased dramatically over the last year , these rises are the highest we have seen from any supplier . "

british gas announced the cost of gas will rise by 12.4 % , while the price of electricity will go up by 9.4 % .
energywatch said next month 's increases were " a body blow to consumers " .
" this price rise is going to add millions to bills and expose many thousands of households to the risk of fuel poverty , " said boss allan asher .
british gas has acknowledged that some customers may struggle to cope with the increase , which it blames on the rising wholesale cost of gas , and has set aside £ 10m to protect vulnerable customers .
click here to see where the world 's gas lies however , it is unclear how this money will be distributed .
our message to british gas customers is to shop around and get yourself a better deal industry regulator ofgem energywatch gave the fund a cautious welcome , but said overall it was " seriously bad news for millions of consumers " .
" it is no surprise that british gas have responded to the rising wholesale cost of gas , but it is by no means clear why the wholesale price is so high , " mr asher said .
he added that energywatch would be calling for an investigation into the wholesale market .
industry regulator ofgem also criticised the increase , and urged british gas customers to change supplier , saying there were " no prizes for loyalty " .
" our message to british gas customers is to shop around and get yourself a better deal , " a spokesman told bbc news online .
however , ofgem itself was criticised by former energy minister brian wilson .
he said the latest price increases demanded an urgent rethink of britain 's proposed reliance on imported gas and the role of ofgem .
impact on average bill * gas paid quarterly : £ 422 a year to £ 474 a year gas paid by direct debit : £ 378 a year to £ 425 a year electricity paid quarterly : £ 257 a year to £ 281 a year electricity paid by direct debit : £ 245 a year to £ 268 a year prepayment gas : £ 422 a year to £ 474 a year prepayment electricity : £ 273 a year to £ 299 a year * average usage and prices include vat .
source : british gas why are prices rising ?
" both within government and subsequently , i have been warning about the extreme short-termism of the policies being pursued by ofgem . "
the new prices come after british gas put up prices for its 6.2 million electricity customers and 18.4 million gas customers in january , when it added an extra 5.9 % to customers ' bills .
the latest increases take effect from 20 september and are expected to add an extra £ 52 a year to a typical gas bill , which is paid quarterly .
the cost of wholesale gas has risen sharply in the past year , partly as a result of higher crude oil prices .
competition for electricity , the new prices are expected to add an average of £ 24 a year to a typical bill , paid quarterly , or £ 26 a year for customers who pay by a prepayment meter .
there are six major gas and electricity suppliers and a range of smaller suppliers which disgruntled british gas customers could switch to .
powergen has already increased its prices twice this year and the other gas and electricity suppliers are expected to follow suit .
" historically ... when british gas puts up its prices , the other suppliers tend to follow suit , " said jenny evans , spokesman for energy comparison website uswitch.com.
" but while wholesale gas prices have increased dramatically over the last year , these rises are the highest we have seen from any supplier . "

childline cymru said it has been contacted by almost 4,500 young people this year - compared to just under 3,000 in 2003 .
the charity said bullying is the single biggest reason why children phone its special helpline and now accounts for one in four calls .
most of the youngsters ringing in were aged in their early teens .
the childline cymru / wales figures show a rise in the number of calls by more than 60 % . "
bullying wrecks lives - as childline 's new figures show , there is still much to be done " esther rantzen the charity 's counsellors in wales received 4,408 calls in the 12 months to march this year from children .
in the same period up to march 2003 , the helpline responded to 2,803 calls .
the charity also warned that bullies were increasingly using threatening text and e-mail messages .
jonathan green , the head of childline cymru said he hoped the increase in calls was at least partly due to young people being encouraged to report and seek help about being bullied .
he said : " it could be because they 're getting the message that bullying does n't have to be tolerated - i would hope it 's because children feel they can speak out if they 're being bullied .
" it can leave them feeling worthless , traumatised and afraid to go to school , and that can have an effect lasting right into adulthood . "
mr green said it was also " quite frightening " that one in four of those who had called had already reported being bullied to a teacher .
world boxing champion joe calzaghe , from newbridge - who suffered from bullying as a teenager - urged children who were being targeted by bullies to speak up about the problem .
the 2004 figures are revealed by the charity as it launches a new fundraising initiative - the childline foundation .
found shelter childline 's chair esther rantzen said : " our volunteer counsellors tell us that the calls they receive about bullying are some of the most painful they encounter at childline .
" while many schools have taken positive steps in recent years to acknowledge that bullying exists and to tackle the problem , as childline 's new figures show , there is still much to be done . "
childline cymru / wales has helped more than 20,000 victims of bullying through its helpline centres in rhyl and swansea .
it offers both welsh and english language services .
so far , the charity has helped 150,000 children in wales since it was set up in 1993 , saving lives , protecting youngsters from abuse and found shelter for children on the streets .
the free uk-wide helpline service was set up in the 1980s , following an appeal on the bbc programme that 's life for viewers ' help in conducting a survey on child abuse .
the helpline now receives more than 138,000 calls each year .

childline cymru said it has been contacted by almost 4,500 young people this year - compared to just under 3,000 in 2003 .
the charity said bullying is the single biggest reason why children phone its special helpline and now accounts for one in four calls .
most of the youngsters ringing in were aged in their early teens .
the childline cymru / wales figures show a rise in the number of calls by more than 60 % .
bullying wrecks lives - as childline 's new figures show , there is still much to be done esther rantzen the charity 's counsellors in wales received 4,408 calls in the 12 months to march this year from children .
in the same period up to march 2003 , the helpline responded to 2,803 calls .
the charity also warned that bullies were increasingly using threatening text and e-mail messages .
jonathan green , the head of childline cymru said he hoped the increase in calls was at least partly due to young people being encouraged to report and seek help about being bullied .
he said : " it could be because they 're getting the message that bullying does n't have to be tolerated - i would hope it 's because children feel they can speak out if they 're being bullied .
" it can leave them feeling worthless , traumatised and afraid to go to school , and that can have an effect lasting right into adulthood . "

the east anglian ambulance trust says expecting a fully-equipped ambulance to arrive within 19 minutes of a 999 call is unrealistic .
trust chief executive dr chris carney said that if a paramedic on the scene deemed the need not serious , it avoided the dangers of a racing ambulance .
minor calls can easily be dealt with by a first response paramedic , he said .
the trust believes the 30-year-old guidelines do not reflect modern practice .
treatment on scene as an example , dr carney said calls from someone suffering from a non-life-threatening condition , such as a panic attack , could be treated either at the patient 's home or taken to a local hospital or surgery in the paramedic 's car .
the trust , which covers norfolk , suffolk and cambridgeshire , has included the use of estate cars and other emergency response vehicles in its target time submission to the department of health .
when those vehicles are included , the trust exceeded a 95 % response time target , but director of operations paul sutton said if only full ambulance responses were counted , it would not have met its targets .
the government last week announced that minor 999 calls would no longer require a full ambulance ; they can be dealt with by advice from a nurse or a non-emergency ambulance response .
but dr carney says the changes do not go far enough and has written to the department of health asking for the issue to be addressed in a review of ambulance targets .
patients ' satisfied ' a spokesman for the department of health said , in response : " the department 's focus has always been that patients ' emergency care needs should be met quickly and appropriately .
" the target is about getting to patients with critical conditions as quickly as possible so that life-saving treatment can be provided at the scene .
" ambulance trusts ' responses vary to suit the seriousness of the callout , providing a clinically appropriate response to meet patient need . "
he said that more patients were being treated faster than before , and that a recent survey showed 98 % of ambulance patients " are overwhelmingly satisfied " with their treatment .
the department is reviewing its guidance on reporting ambulance response times , the spokesman added .

trust chief executive dr chris carney said that if a paramedic on the scene deemed the need not serious , it avoided the dangers of a racing ambulance .
minor calls can easily be dealt with by a first response paramedic , he said .
the trust believes the 30-year-old guidelines do not reflect modern practice .
treatment on scene as an example , dr carney said calls from someone suffering from a non-life-threatening condition , such as a panic attack , could be treated either at the patient 's home or taken to a local hospital or surgery in the paramedic 's car .
the trust , which covers norfolk , suffolk and cambridgeshire , has included the use of estate cars and other emergency response vehicles in its target time submission to the department of health .
when those vehicles are included , the trust exceeded a 95 % response time target , but director of operations paul sutton said if only full ambulance responses were counted , it would not have met its targets .
the government last week announced that minor 999 calls would no longer require a full ambulance ; they can be dealt with by advice from a nurse or a non-emergency ambulance response .
but dr carney says the changes do not go far enough and has written to the department of health asking for the issue to be addressed in a review of ambulance targets .
patients ' satisfied ' a spokesman for the department of health said , in response : " the department 's focus has always been that patients ' emergency care needs should be met quickly and appropriately .
" the target is about getting to patients with critical conditions as quickly as possible so that life-saving treatment can be provided at the scene .
" ambulance trusts ' responses vary to suit the seriousness of the callout , providing a clinically appropriate response to meet patient need . "
he said that more patients were being treated faster than before , and that a recent survey showed 98 % of ambulance patients " are overwhelmingly satisfied " with their treatment .
the department is reviewing its guidance on reporting ambulance response times , the spokesman added .

its trustees are currently consulting bodies such as the international obesity task force , the national heart forum , and diabetes uk , but dr campbell said he hoped it would be up and running by early 2005 .
if we do n't do something about this the next generation will die before their parents virginia hill , producer of fat nation he told bbc news online : " we 've got a situation where we will soon be as bad as the united states , with as many as 30 % - one in three adults - being clinically obese .
" the reason why it 's so important to reverse that is because of the diseases that it causes .
" type two diabetes is set to double by 2010 .
heart disease , although we 've become more successful at treating it , is occurring in greater frequency .
" the causes of obesity are many .
there is no single , simple cause , there is no single , simple solution .
" we need the support of government to give us teeth . "
dartford mp howard stoate , also a gp , said : " doing nothing is not an option .
" the government can not hope to tackle this alone .
in one way or another it affects everybody and everybody has a role to play . "
children 's health virginia hill , producer of fat nation , a new bbc series which explores how to tackle being overweight , believes some kind of forum or pressure group " can only do good " .
she said : " if we do n't do anything about this the next generation will die before their parents .
" billions of pounds is spent on advertising foods and drinks which are n't good for us , but very little is spent in comparison to get good nutritional advice across to parents and children .
" most of the parents i 've spoken to are very concerned about their children 's health and doing the right thing by their kids - they feel they need more information . "
dr campbell also believes the new taskforce will ultimately save money .
he said : " this is a financial issue because it already costs the government in excess of £ 3bn a year .
" by turning the problem round and reducing levels of obesity , it may even be that we will reduce those costs - almost in the end actually save money rather than cost money . "
fat nation - the big challenge " begins on 9 september .

dr campbell also believes the new taskforce will ultimately save money .
he said : " this is a financial issue because it already costs the government in excess of £ 3bn a year .
" by turning the problem round and reducing levels of obesity , it may even be that we will reduce those costs - almost in the end actually save money rather than cost money . "
