the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .

" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .

britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .
the atmosphere in the team is good . " latvia -lrb- probable -rrb- : kolinko , isakovs , zemlinskis , stepanovs , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , astafjevs , laizans , rubins , verpakovskis , pahars .
germany -lrb- probable -rrb- : kahn , friedrich , worns , nowotny , lahm ; baumann , schneider -lrb- or schweinsteiger -rrb- , ballack , hamann ; frings , kuranyi . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .
-lrb- june 15 , 2004 -rrb- czechs avoid baltic embarrassment group d favorite the czech republic barely managed to avoid a humiliating defeat on tuesday , coming from behind to thwart an early latvian lead to win 2-1 .

" as long as russia is unsure about whether it is going to the direction of a democracy and a liberal market economy or not , it will be very difficult for the eu to have a much better relationship with the russians , " barysch , who recently presented her book on eu-russia relations . but optimists point to proven progress in eu-russian relations , despite the lack of democracy and a market economy .
for example , at the end of may , the two sides agreed to russia 's entry into the world trade organization . richard wright , the head of the eu delegation in moscow , is one of those optimists . " i think the authors underestimate what has been achieved , and the starting point , which was after all very different , " he said . will eu constitution help ? only fifteen years ago , russia and the european union were bitter political enemies with radically different economic systems .
but the critic barysch looks at the problems of today : for example , russians need a visa to enter the eu . and russia just recently agreed to lift a ban on meat imports from eu countries .
barysch thinks an eu constitution would make it all much easier . " we 'd have a foreign minister that would probably bring more cohesion to foreign policy , and we would get rid of the rotating presidency and get rid of this activism and inertia cycle and all the initiatives which get started every six months , " said barysch , who works as chief economist at the center for european reform in london and runs the organization 's russia program . she added that because individual eu countries like france and germany do n't always tow the eu line , russia views europe as divided . wright on the other hand points to the 1997 eu-russian partnership and co-operation agreement : europe and russia are trying , however imperfectly , to build common space where they work together on justice , security , and education . " step by step we are building more confidence and trust which i think is the key to partnership , " he said . both the critics and the optimists agree that there are at least some problems in the relationship , but no all out crisis . and both agree that it should never come to that , because the two sides are too important for each other . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu assesses ties with russia the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .

" we 'd have a foreign minister that would probably bring more cohesion to foreign policy , and we would get rid of the rotating presidency and get rid of this activism and inertia cycle and all the initiatives which get started every six months , " said barysch , who works as chief economist at the center for european reform in london and runs the organization 's russia program . she added that because individual eu countries like france and germany do n't always tow the eu line , russia views europe as divided . wright on the other hand points to the 1997 eu-russian partnership and co-operation agreement : europe and russia are trying , however imperfectly , to build common space where they work together on justice , security , and education . " step by step we are building more confidence and trust which i think is the key to partnership , " he said . both the critics and the optimists agree that there are at least some problems in the relationship , but no all out crisis . and both agree that it should never come to that , because the two sides are too important for each other . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu assesses ties with russia the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .
the atmosphere in the team is good . " latvia -lrb- probable -rrb- : kolinko , isakovs , zemlinskis , stepanovs , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , astafjevs , laizans , rubins , verpakovskis , pahars .

for example , at the end of may , the two sides agreed to russia 's entry into the world trade organization . richard wright , the head of the eu delegation in moscow , is one of those optimists . " i think the authors underestimate what has been achieved , and the starting point , which was after all very different , " he said . will eu constitution help ? only fifteen years ago , russia and the european union were bitter political enemies with radically different economic systems .
but the critic barysch looks at the problems of today : for example , russians need a visa to enter the eu . and russia just recently agreed to lift a ban on meat imports from eu countries .
barysch thinks an eu constitution would make it all much easier . " we 'd have a foreign minister that would probably bring more cohesion to foreign policy , and we would get rid of the rotating presidency and get rid of this activism and inertia cycle and all the initiatives which get started every six months , " said barysch , who works as chief economist at the center for european reform in london and runs the organization 's russia program . she added that because individual eu countries like france and germany do n't always tow the eu line , russia views europe as divided . wright on the other hand points to the 1997 eu-russian partnership and co-operation agreement : europe and russia are trying , however imperfectly , to build common space where they work together on justice , security , and education . " step by step we are building more confidence and trust which i think is the key to partnership , " he said . both the critics and the optimists agree that there are at least some problems in the relationship , but no all out crisis . and both agree that it should never come to that , because the two sides are too important for each other . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu assesses ties with russia the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .
the atmosphere in the team is good . " latvia -lrb- probable -rrb- : kolinko , isakovs , zemlinskis , stepanovs , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , astafjevs , laizans , rubins , verpakovskis , pahars .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .
the atmosphere in the team is good . " latvia -lrb- probable -rrb- : kolinko , isakovs , zemlinskis , stepanovs , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , astafjevs , laizans , rubins , verpakovskis , pahars .
germany -lrb- probable -rrb- : kahn , friedrich , worns , nowotny , lahm ; baumann , schneider -lrb- or schweinsteiger -rrb- , ballack , hamann ; frings , kuranyi . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .
" that really was a hard game , we had to fight to the end , " van nistelrooy said . after beating latvia 2-1 earlier in the day , the czech republic now top group d. the czechs will next face holland on june 19 , the same day germany will take on latvia . lineups : germany : oliver kahn ; arne friedrich , christian wörns , jens nowotny , philipp lahm , frank baumann , bernd schneider , dietmar hamann , michael ballack , torsten frings , kevin kuranyi . netherlands : edwin van der sar ; johnny heitinga , jaap stam , wilfred bouma , giovanni van bronckhorst , phillip cocu , edgar davids , boudewijn zenden , rafael van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy , andy van der meyde . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany meets holland for soccer showdown when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland .

german goalkeeper oliver kahn is faced with a difficult choice in the euro 2004 game against latvia tonight : he can either help his team stay in the championships or take up an offer of honorary latvian citizenship . family ties might already make it possible for kahn to obtain a passport from the baltic country : after all , his paternal grandmother was latvian and his father was born there . but latvia 's ambassador to germany thought he might at least try to convince kahn to help the latvian team score at least one goal . " actually , we do n't have a chance in the match , " martin virsis told german tabloid bild .
" but if kahn makes mistakes and we advance , we 'll make him an honorary citizen . " virsis also tried to encourage kahn with another statement : " in latvia , the women are more attractive than in germany . " kahn recently split up with his girlfriend , saying that he wanted to concentrate more on his career .

the countries intend to promote tolerance and mutual understanding in the area of conflict . officials from germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , which partners in the ramallah project , believe that because of the last century of german history , the country is particularly well-qualified to be a moderator between european and palestinian culture . " this is something that is accepted everywhere , that germany has come to terms with its past and has acknowledged the mistakes that it made , " said klaus krischkok , a spokesman for the institute .
" a country that has 50 years of democracy , and 50 years of coming to terms with its own history comes across as more credible . " ramallah is at the center of the palestinian crisis .
palestinian leader yassir arafat has been kept there under virtual house arrest by the israeli army for two and a half years , and the city has been the scene of major israeli military operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , and jutta limbach , who serves as the goethe institute 's president the goethe institute has centers all over the world dedicated to spreading german culture - most recently it opened up a branch in north korea , the nation whose borders are most closed to the outside world . both the west bank and north korea are places of poverty and oppression , with more pressing problems than a lack of european culture . helping to avoid future conflicts but krischkok said that precisely in such regions , it 's wise to channel resources into a goethe institute . " part of german foreign policy is the position of cultural programs , " he said .
" simply because culture , education , dialogue have a certain function in promoting tolerance , promoting mutual understanding , which will help to eventually avoid future conflicts and that , i think , is a good investment . " along with the goethe institute , the french cultural organization centre culturel francais is helping to open the center , which is funded by the european union and the french-german television station arte . both sides are making it clear that their function is not only to transmit their national cultures , but also " european culture " - a problematic task , because europe is full of various cultures , languages , and political points of view . radical differences between europe and places like north korea or the west bank further complicate the exchange . " in the special case of germany and korea , there have been relatively strong links between north korea and the german democratic republic , " he said .
" these links have been pretty much cut for the last 15 years , since the gdr ceased to exist , but there are people who speak german , read german . in the case of the palestinian territories , there 's a sizeable community of palestinian immigrants in germany . " the west bank facility will be heavily guarded , as are most western installations in the middle east . however , goethe institute officials stressed that it will be open to the public . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens center in north korea with the opening of its reading room in pyongyang , germany ’ s goethe institute has become the first western cultural organization to open shop in north korea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2004 european leaders agree on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the document can take effect in 2006 at the earliest after more than a year of back and forth , european leaders approved the constitution that will serve as the blueprint for the future direction of the eu . european leaders managed to find enough common ground to approve the text of europe 's first-ever constitution late on friday night .
the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
a second failure would have made it difficult for further european unity and legislation , since the constitution was drafted with enlargement in mind , and it would have further alienated brussels from europe 's citizens . dw staff -lrb- dsl and dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans back eu constitution compromise eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 19.06.2004 human rights groups target sportswear giants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made in a sweatshop ?
as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .

thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .

" according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory .

in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .

albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2004 european leaders agree on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the document can take effect in 2006 at the earliest after more than a year of back and forth , european leaders approved the constitution that will serve as the blueprint for the future direction of the eu . european leaders managed to find enough common ground to approve the text of europe 's first-ever constitution late on friday night .
the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .

the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .

britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .

but the author of a new book argues that the relationship has some fundamental flaws . katinka barysch is a critic of eu-russian relations : she says they wo n't get much better until the political and economic direction of russia becomes clearer . " as long as russia is unsure about whether it is going to the direction of a democracy and a liberal market economy or not , it will be very difficult for the eu to have a much better relationship with the russians , " barysch , who recently presented her book on eu-russia relations . but optimists point to proven progress in eu-russian relations , despite the lack of democracy and a market economy .
for example , at the end of may , the two sides agreed to russia 's entry into the world trade organization . richard wright , the head of the eu delegation in moscow , is one of those optimists . " i think the authors underestimate what has been achieved , and the starting point , which was after all very different , " he said . will eu constitution help ? only fifteen years ago , russia and the european union were bitter political enemies with radically different economic systems .
but the critic barysch looks at the problems of today : for example , russians need a visa to enter the eu . and russia just recently agreed to lift a ban on meat imports from eu countries .
barysch thinks an eu constitution would make it all much easier . " we 'd have a foreign minister that would probably bring more cohesion to foreign policy , and we would get rid of the rotating presidency and get rid of this activism and inertia cycle and all the initiatives which get started every six months , " said barysch , who works as chief economist at the center for european reform in london and runs the organization 's russia program . she added that because individual eu countries like france and germany do n't always tow the eu line , russia views europe as divided . wright on the other hand points to the 1997 eu-russian partnership and co-operation agreement : europe and russia are trying , however imperfectly , to build common space where they work together on justice , security , and education . " step by step we are building more confidence and trust which i think is the key to partnership , " he said . both the critics and the optimists agree that there are at least some problems in the relationship , but no all out crisis . and both agree that it should never come to that , because the two sides are too important for each other . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu assesses ties with russia the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .

" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
a second failure would have made it difficult for further european unity and legislation , since the constitution was drafted with enlargement in mind , and it would have further alienated brussels from europe 's citizens . dw staff -lrb- dsl and dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans back eu constitution compromise eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings .

german goalkeeper oliver kahn is faced with a difficult choice in the euro 2004 game against latvia tonight : he can either help his team stay in the championships or take up an offer of honorary latvian citizenship . family ties might already make it possible for kahn to obtain a passport from the baltic country : after all , his paternal grandmother was latvian and his father was born there . but latvia 's ambassador to germany thought he might at least try to convince kahn to help the latvian team score at least one goal . " actually , we do n't have a chance in the match , " martin virsis told german tabloid bild .
" but if kahn makes mistakes and we advance , we 'll make him an honorary citizen . " virsis also tried to encourage kahn with another statement : " in latvia , the women are more attractive than in germany . " kahn recently split up with his girlfriend , saying that he wanted to concentrate more on his career .

german goalkeeper oliver kahn is faced with a difficult choice in the euro 2004 game against latvia tonight : he can either help his team stay in the championships or take up an offer of honorary latvian citizenship . family ties might already make it possible for kahn to obtain a passport from the baltic country : after all , his paternal grandmother was latvian and his father was born there . but latvia 's ambassador to germany thought he might at least try to convince kahn to help the latvian team score at least one goal . " actually , we do n't have a chance in the match , " martin virsis told german tabloid bild .
" but if kahn makes mistakes and we advance , we 'll make him an honorary citizen . " virsis also tried to encourage kahn with another statement : " in latvia , the women are more attractive than in germany . " kahn recently split up with his girlfriend , saying that he wanted to concentrate more on his career .

the countries intend to promote tolerance and mutual understanding in the area of conflict . officials from germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , which partners in the ramallah project , believe that because of the last century of german history , the country is particularly well-qualified to be a moderator between european and palestinian culture . " this is something that is accepted everywhere , that germany has come to terms with its past and has acknowledged the mistakes that it made , " said klaus krischkok , a spokesman for the institute .
" a country that has 50 years of democracy , and 50 years of coming to terms with its own history comes across as more credible . " ramallah is at the center of the palestinian crisis .
palestinian leader yassir arafat has been kept there under virtual house arrest by the israeli army for two and a half years , and the city has been the scene of major israeli military operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , and jutta limbach , who serves as the goethe institute 's president the goethe institute has centers all over the world dedicated to spreading german culture - most recently it opened up a branch in north korea , the nation whose borders are most closed to the outside world . both the west bank and north korea are places of poverty and oppression , with more pressing problems than a lack of european culture . helping to avoid future conflicts but krischkok said that precisely in such regions , it 's wise to channel resources into a goethe institute . " part of german foreign policy is the position of cultural programs , " he said .
" simply because culture , education , dialogue have a certain function in promoting tolerance , promoting mutual understanding , which will help to eventually avoid future conflicts and that , i think , is a good investment . " along with the goethe institute , the french cultural organization centre culturel francais is helping to open the center , which is funded by the european union and the french-german television station arte . both sides are making it clear that their function is not only to transmit their national cultures , but also " european culture " - a problematic task , because europe is full of various cultures , languages , and political points of view . radical differences between europe and places like north korea or the west bank further complicate the exchange . " in the special case of germany and korea , there have been relatively strong links between north korea and the german democratic republic , " he said .
" these links have been pretty much cut for the last 15 years , since the gdr ceased to exist , but there are people who speak german , read german . in the case of the palestinian territories , there 's a sizeable community of palestinian immigrants in germany . " the west bank facility will be heavily guarded , as are most western installations in the middle east . however , goethe institute officials stressed that it will be open to the public . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens center in north korea with the opening of its reading room in pyongyang , germany ’ s goethe institute has become the first western cultural organization to open shop in north korea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2004 european leaders agree on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the document can take effect in 2006 at the earliest after more than a year of back and forth , european leaders approved the constitution that will serve as the blueprint for the future direction of the eu . european leaders managed to find enough common ground to approve the text of europe 's first-ever constitution late on friday night .
the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
a second failure would have made it difficult for further european unity and legislation , since the constitution was drafted with enlargement in mind , and it would have further alienated brussels from europe 's citizens . dw staff -lrb- dsl and dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans back eu constitution compromise eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .
the atmosphere in the team is good . " latvia -lrb- probable -rrb- : kolinko , isakovs , zemlinskis , stepanovs , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , astafjevs , laizans , rubins , verpakovskis , pahars .

" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of .

the countries intend to promote tolerance and mutual understanding in the area of conflict . officials from germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , which partners in the ramallah project , believe that because of the last century of german history , the country is particularly well-qualified to be a moderator between european and palestinian culture . " this is something that is accepted everywhere , that germany has come to terms with its past and has acknowledged the mistakes that it made , " said klaus krischkok , a spokesman for the institute .
" a country that has 50 years of democracy , and 50 years of coming to terms with its own history comes across as more credible . " ramallah is at the center of the palestinian crisis .
palestinian leader yassir arafat has been kept there under virtual house arrest by the israeli army for two and a half years , and the city has been the scene of major israeli military operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , and jutta limbach , who serves as the goethe institute 's president the goethe institute has centers all over the world dedicated to spreading german culture - most recently it opened up a branch in north korea , the nation whose borders are most closed to the outside world . both the west bank and north korea are places of poverty and oppression , with more pressing problems than a lack of european culture . helping to avoid future conflicts but krischkok said that precisely in such regions , it 's wise to channel resources into a goethe institute . " part of german foreign policy is the position of cultural programs , " he said .
" simply because culture , education , dialogue have a certain function in promoting tolerance , promoting mutual understanding , which will help to eventually avoid future conflicts and that , i think , is a good investment . " along with the goethe institute , the french cultural organization centre culturel francais is helping to open the center , which is funded by the european union and the french-german television station arte . both sides are making it clear that their function is not only to transmit their national cultures , but also " european culture " - a problematic task , because europe is full of various cultures , languages , and political points of view . radical differences between europe and places like north korea or the west bank further complicate the exchange . " in the special case of germany and korea , there have been relatively strong links between north korea and the german democratic republic , " he said .
" these links have been pretty much cut for the last 15 years , since the gdr ceased to exist , but there are people who speak german , read german . in the case of the palestinian territories , there 's a sizeable community of palestinian immigrants in germany . " the west bank facility will be heavily guarded , as are most western installations in the middle east . however , goethe institute officials stressed that it will be open to the public . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens center in north korea with the opening of its reading room in pyongyang , germany ’ s goethe institute has become the first western cultural organization to open shop in north korea .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .

german goalkeeper oliver kahn is faced with a difficult choice in the euro 2004 game against latvia tonight : he can either help his team stay in the championships or take up an offer of honorary latvian citizenship . family ties might already make it possible for kahn to obtain a passport from the baltic country : after all , his paternal grandmother was latvian and his father was born there . but latvia 's ambassador to germany thought he might at least try to convince kahn to help the latvian team score at least one goal . " actually , we do n't have a chance in the match , " martin virsis told german tabloid bild .
" but if kahn makes mistakes and we advance , we 'll make him an honorary citizen . " virsis also tried to encourage kahn with another statement : " in latvia , the women are more attractive than in germany . " kahn recently split up with his girlfriend , saying that he wanted to concentrate more on his career .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2004 european leaders agree on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the document can take effect in 2006 at the earliest after more than a year of back and forth , european leaders approved the constitution that will serve as the blueprint for the future direction of the eu . european leaders managed to find enough common ground to approve the text of europe 's first-ever constitution late on friday night .
the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
a second failure would have made it difficult for further european unity and legislation , since the constitution was drafted with enlargement in mind , and it would have further alienated brussels from europe 's citizens . dw staff -lrb- dsl and dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans back eu constitution compromise eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .
the atmosphere in the team is good . " latvia -lrb- probable -rrb- : kolinko , isakovs , zemlinskis , stepanovs , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , astafjevs , laizans , rubins , verpakovskis , pahars .
germany -lrb- probable -rrb- : kahn , friedrich , worns , nowotny , lahm ; baumann , schneider -lrb- or schweinsteiger -rrb- , ballack , hamann ; frings , kuranyi . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .
-lrb- june 15 , 2004 -rrb- czechs avoid baltic embarrassment group d favorite the czech republic barely managed to avoid a humiliating defeat on tuesday , coming from behind to thwart an early latvian lead to win 2-1 .

the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .

the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .

it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .

the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
a second failure would have made it difficult for further european unity and legislation , since the constitution was drafted with enlargement in mind , and it would have further alienated brussels from europe 's citizens . dw staff -lrb- dsl and dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans back eu constitution compromise eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .

" the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .

" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .

but the author of a new book argues that the relationship has some fundamental flaws . katinka barysch is a critic of eu-russian relations : she says they wo n't get much better until the political and economic direction of russia becomes clearer . " as long as russia is unsure about whether it is going to the direction of a democracy and a liberal market economy or not , it will be very difficult for the eu to have a much better relationship with the russians , " barysch , who recently presented her book on eu-russia relations . but optimists point to proven progress in eu-russian relations , despite the lack of democracy and a market economy .
for example , at the end of may , the two sides agreed to russia 's entry into the world trade organization . richard wright , the head of the eu delegation in moscow , is one of those optimists . " i think the authors underestimate what has been achieved , and the starting point , which was after all very different , " he said . will eu constitution help ? only fifteen years ago , russia and the european union were bitter political enemies with radically different economic systems .
but the critic barysch looks at the problems of today : for example , russians need a visa to enter the eu . and russia just recently agreed to lift a ban on meat imports from eu countries .
barysch thinks an eu constitution would make it all much easier . " we 'd have a foreign minister that would probably bring more cohesion to foreign policy , and we would get rid of the rotating presidency and get rid of this activism and inertia cycle and all the initiatives which get started every six months , " said barysch , who works as chief economist at the center for european reform in london and runs the organization 's russia program . she added that because individual eu countries like france and germany do n't always tow the eu line , russia views europe as divided . wright on the other hand points to the 1997 eu-russian partnership and co-operation agreement : europe and russia are trying , however imperfectly , to build common space where they work together on justice , security , and education . " step by step we are building more confidence and trust which i think is the key to partnership , " he said . both the critics and the optimists agree that there are at least some problems in the relationship , but no all out crisis . and both agree that it should never come to that , because the two sides are too important for each other . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu assesses ties with russia the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .

" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .
that would leave germany and holland scrapping for the last qualifying spot in the group . netherlands -lrb- probable -rrb- : van der sar , heitinga , bouma , stam , van bronckhorst , sneijder , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy .

german goalkeeper oliver kahn is faced with a difficult choice in the euro 2004 game against latvia tonight : he can either help his team stay in the championships or take up an offer of honorary latvian citizenship . family ties might already make it possible for kahn to obtain a passport from the baltic country : after all , his paternal grandmother was latvian and his father was born there . but latvia 's ambassador to germany thought he might at least try to convince kahn to help the latvian team score at least one goal . " actually , we do n't have a chance in the match , " martin virsis told german tabloid bild .
" but if kahn makes mistakes and we advance , we 'll make him an honorary citizen . " virsis also tried to encourage kahn with another statement : " in latvia , the women are more attractive than in germany .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2004 european leaders agree on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the document can take effect in 2006 at the earliest after more than a year of back and forth , european leaders approved the constitution that will serve as the blueprint for the future direction of the eu . european leaders managed to find enough common ground to approve the text of europe 's first-ever constitution late on friday night .
the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .

thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .

" according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .

in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .
but critics insist the concept unreasonably equates the tyranny of the two regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke the plan 's architect , cdu bundestag member günter nooke , a former civil rights activist and dissident in east germany , plays down the political implications .
" it 's ridiculous to say this implies a shift change in the politics of memory , " he insists .
" anyone who says it does , has n't read the motion . " according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .
" anything that suggests we are relativizing our past can only damage germany 's reputation , " she said . angry protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past the infamous " work makes you free " slogan in the gate to a nazi concentration camp in dachau near munich over the years , germany has erected some 3,500 memorials for the victims of national socialism .
in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .
and with public funds for remembrance policies continuing to shrink , it is unlikely berlin will be able to invest in many more memorials - at least not for the time being . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2004 european leaders agree on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the document can take effect in 2006 at the earliest after more than a year of back and forth , european leaders approved the constitution that will serve as the blueprint for the future direction of the eu . european leaders managed to find enough common ground to approve the text of europe 's first-ever constitution late on friday night .
the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .

the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .

" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .

germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .
" that really was a hard game , we had to fight to the end , " van nistelrooy said . after beating latvia 2-1 earlier in the day , the czech republic now top group d. the czechs will next face holland on june 19 , the same day germany will take on latvia . lineups : germany : oliver kahn ; arne friedrich , christian wörns , jens nowotny , philipp lahm , frank baumann , bernd schneider , dietmar hamann , michael ballack , torsten frings , kevin kuranyi . netherlands : edwin van der sar ; johnny heitinga , jaap stam , wilfred bouma , giovanni van bronckhorst , phillip cocu , edgar davids , boudewijn zenden , rafael van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy , andy van der meyde . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany meets holland for soccer showdown when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2004 examining eu-russian relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two presidents : russia 's vladimir putin and the eu 's romano prodi the eu is russia 's number one trading partner , and russia is the bloc 's main supplier of oil .
but the author of a new book argues that the relationship has some fundamental flaws . katinka barysch is a critic of eu-russian relations : she says they wo n't get much better until the political and economic direction of russia becomes clearer . " as long as russia is unsure about whether it is going to the direction of a democracy and a liberal market economy or not , it will be very difficult for the eu to have a much better relationship with the russians , " barysch , who recently presented her book on eu-russia relations . but optimists point to proven progress in eu-russian relations , despite the lack of democracy and a market economy .
for example , at the end of may , the two sides agreed to russia 's entry into the world trade organization . richard wright , the head of the eu delegation in moscow , is one of those optimists . " i think the authors underestimate what has been achieved , and the starting point , which was after all very different , " he said . will eu constitution help ? only fifteen years ago , russia and the european union were bitter political enemies with radically different economic systems .
but the critic barysch looks at the problems of today : for example , russians need a visa to enter the eu . and russia just recently agreed to lift a ban on meat imports from eu countries .

german goalkeeper oliver kahn is faced with a difficult choice in the euro 2004 game against latvia tonight : he can either help his team stay in the championships or take up an offer of honorary latvian citizenship . family ties might already make it possible for kahn to obtain a passport from the baltic country : after all , his paternal grandmother was latvian and his father was born there . but latvia 's ambassador to germany thought he might at least try to convince kahn to help the latvian team score at least one goal . " actually , we do n't have a chance in the match , " martin virsis told german tabloid bild .
" but if kahn makes mistakes and we advance , we 'll make him an honorary citizen . " virsis also tried to encourage kahn with another statement : " in latvia , the women are more attractive than in germany . " kahn recently split up with his girlfriend , saying that he wanted to concentrate more on his career .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .
that would leave germany and holland scrapping for the last qualifying spot in the group . netherlands -lrb- probable -rrb- : van der sar , heitinga , bouma , stam , van bronckhorst , sneijder , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .
but critics insist the concept unreasonably equates the tyranny of the two regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke the plan 's architect , cdu bundestag member günter nooke , a former civil rights activist and dissident in east germany , plays down the political implications .
" it 's ridiculous to say this implies a shift change in the politics of memory , " he insists .
" anyone who says it does , has n't read the motion . " according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .
" anything that suggests we are relativizing our past can only damage germany 's reputation , " she said . angry protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past the infamous " work makes you free " slogan in the gate to a nazi concentration camp in dachau near munich over the years , germany has erected some 3,500 memorials for the victims of national socialism .
in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .
and with public funds for remembrance policies continuing to shrink , it is unlikely berlin will be able to invest in many more memorials - at least not for the time being . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2004 european leaders agree on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the document can take effect in 2006 at the earliest after more than a year of back and forth , european leaders approved the constitution that will serve as the blueprint for the future direction of the eu . european leaders managed to find enough common ground to approve the text of europe 's first-ever constitution late on friday night .
the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
a second failure would have made it difficult for further european unity and legislation , since the constitution was drafted with enlargement in mind , and it would have further alienated brussels from europe 's citizens . dw staff -lrb- dsl and dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans back eu constitution compromise eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.06.2004 germans mull controversial memorial concept großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now a private museum : east germany 's stasi headquarters a recent proposal for a nationwide " memorial concept " to jointly honor victims of the soviet occupation , the east german regime as well as victims of the nazis has unleashed a storm of protest . the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chose the day carefully .
thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .
but critics insist the concept unreasonably equates the tyranny of the two regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke the plan 's architect , cdu bundestag member günter nooke , a former civil rights activist and dissident in east germany , plays down the political implications .
" it 's ridiculous to say this implies a shift change in the politics of memory , " he insists .
" anyone who says it does , has n't read the motion . " according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .
" anything that suggests we are relativizing our past can only damage germany 's reputation , " she said . angry protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past the infamous " work makes you free " slogan in the gate to a nazi concentration camp in dachau near munich over the years , germany has erected some 3,500 memorials for the victims of national socialism .
in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .
and with public funds for remembrance policies continuing to shrink , it is unlikely berlin will be able to invest in many more memorials - at least not for the time being . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .
" that really was a hard game , we had to fight to the end , " van nistelrooy said . after beating latvia 2-1 earlier in the day , the czech republic now top group d. the czechs will next face holland on june 19 , the same day germany will take on latvia . lineups : germany : oliver kahn ; arne friedrich , christian wörns , jens nowotny , philipp lahm , frank baumann , bernd schneider , dietmar hamann , michael ballack , torsten frings , kevin kuranyi . netherlands : edwin van der sar ; johnny heitinga , jaap stam , wilfred bouma , giovanni van bronckhorst , phillip cocu , edgar davids , boudewijn zenden , rafael van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy , andy van der meyde . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany meets holland for soccer showdown when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .
" that really was a hard game , we had to fight to the end , " van nistelrooy said . after beating latvia 2-1 earlier in the day , the czech republic now top group d. the czechs will next face holland on june 19 , the same day germany will take on latvia . lineups : germany : oliver kahn ; arne friedrich , christian wörns , jens nowotny , philipp lahm , frank baumann , bernd schneider , dietmar hamann , michael ballack , torsten frings , kevin kuranyi . netherlands : edwin van der sar ; johnny heitinga , jaap stam , wilfred bouma , giovanni van bronckhorst , phillip cocu , edgar davids , boudewijn zenden , rafael van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy , andy van der meyde . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany meets holland for soccer showdown when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .
but critics insist the concept unreasonably equates the tyranny of the two regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke the plan 's architect , cdu bundestag member günter nooke , a former civil rights activist and dissident in east germany , plays down the political implications .
" it 's ridiculous to say this implies a shift change in the politics of memory , " he insists .
" anyone who says it does , has n't read the motion . " according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .
" anything that suggests we are relativizing our past can only damage germany 's reputation , " she said . angry protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past the infamous " work makes you free " slogan in the gate to a nazi concentration camp in dachau near munich over the years , germany has erected some 3,500 memorials for the victims of national socialism .
in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .
and with public funds for remembrance policies continuing to shrink , it is unlikely berlin will be able to invest in many more memorials - at least not for the time being . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

" when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .
but critics insist the concept unreasonably equates the tyranny of the two regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke the plan 's architect , cdu bundestag member günter nooke , a former civil rights activist and dissident in east germany , plays down the political implications .
" it 's ridiculous to say this implies a shift change in the politics of memory , " he insists .
" anyone who says it does , has n't read the motion . " according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .
" anything that suggests we are relativizing our past can only damage germany 's reputation , " she said . angry protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past the infamous " work makes you free " slogan in the gate to a nazi concentration camp in dachau near munich over the years , germany has erected some 3,500 memorials for the victims of national socialism .
in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .
and with public funds for remembrance policies continuing to shrink , it is unlikely berlin will be able to invest in many more memorials - at least not for the time being . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.06.2004 bringing european culture to ramallah großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramallah is at the center of the middle east conflict germany and france are opening a joint cultural center in the west bank city of ramallah this weekend .
the countries intend to promote tolerance and mutual understanding in the area of conflict . officials from germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , which partners in the ramallah project , believe that because of the last century of german history , the country is particularly well-qualified to be a moderator between european and palestinian culture . " this is something that is accepted everywhere , that germany has come to terms with its past and has acknowledged the mistakes that it made , " said klaus krischkok , a spokesman for the institute .
" a country that has 50 years of democracy , and 50 years of coming to terms with its own history comes across as more credible . " ramallah is at the center of the palestinian crisis .
palestinian leader yassir arafat has been kept there under virtual house arrest by the israeli army for two and a half years , and the city has been the scene of major israeli military operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , and jutta limbach , who serves as the goethe institute 's president the goethe institute has centers all over the world dedicated to spreading german culture - most recently it opened up a branch in north korea , the nation whose borders are most closed to the outside world . both the west bank and north korea are places of poverty and oppression , with more pressing problems than a lack of european culture . helping to avoid future conflicts but krischkok said that precisely in such regions , it 's wise to channel resources into a goethe institute . " part of german foreign policy is the position of cultural programs , " he said .
" simply because culture , education , dialogue have a certain function in promoting tolerance , promoting mutual understanding , which will help to eventually avoid future conflicts and that , i think , is a good investment .

german goalkeeper oliver kahn is faced with a difficult choice in the euro 2004 game against latvia tonight : he can either help his team stay in the championships or take up an offer of honorary latvian citizenship . family ties might already make it possible for kahn to obtain a passport from the baltic country : after all , his paternal grandmother was latvian and his father was born there . but latvia 's ambassador to germany thought he might at least try to convince kahn to help the latvian team score at least one goal . " actually , we do n't have a chance in the match , " martin virsis told german tabloid bild .
" but if kahn makes mistakes and we advance , we 'll make him an honorary citizen . " virsis also tried to encourage kahn with another statement : " in latvia , the women are more attractive than in germany . " kahn recently split up with his girlfriend , saying that he wanted to concentrate more on his career .

but the author of a new book argues that the relationship has some fundamental flaws . katinka barysch is a critic of eu-russian relations : she says they wo n't get much better until the political and economic direction of russia becomes clearer . " as long as russia is unsure about whether it is going to the direction of a democracy and a liberal market economy or not , it will be very difficult for the eu to have a much better relationship with the russians , " barysch , who recently presented her book on eu-russia relations . but optimists point to proven progress in eu-russian relations , despite the lack of democracy and a market economy .
for example , at the end of may , the two sides agreed to russia 's entry into the world trade organization . richard wright , the head of the eu delegation in moscow , is one of those optimists . " i think the authors underestimate what has been achieved , and the starting point , which was after all very different , " he said . will eu constitution help ? only fifteen years ago , russia and the european union were bitter political enemies with radically different economic systems .
but the critic barysch looks at the problems of today : for example , russians need a visa to enter the eu . and russia just recently agreed to lift a ban on meat imports from eu countries .
barysch thinks an eu constitution would make it all much easier . " we 'd have a foreign minister that would probably bring more cohesion to foreign policy , and we would get rid of the rotating presidency and get rid of this activism and inertia cycle and all the initiatives which get started every six months , " said barysch , who works as chief economist at the center for european reform in london and runs the organization 's russia program . she added that because individual eu countries like france and germany do n't always tow the eu line , russia views europe as divided . wright on the other hand points to the 1997 eu-russian partnership and co-operation agreement : europe and russia are trying , however imperfectly , to build common space where they work together on justice , security , and education . " step by step we are building more confidence and trust which i think is the key to partnership , " he said . both the critics and the optimists agree that there are at least some problems in the relationship , but no all out crisis . and both agree that it should never come to that , because the two sides are too important for each other . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu assesses ties with russia the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .

thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .
but critics insist the concept unreasonably equates the tyranny of the two regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke the plan 's architect , cdu bundestag member günter nooke , a former civil rights activist and dissident in east germany , plays down the political implications .
" it 's ridiculous to say this implies a shift change in the politics of memory , " he insists .
" anyone who says it does , has n't read the motion . " according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .
" anything that suggests we are relativizing our past can only damage germany 's reputation , " she said . angry protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past the infamous " work makes you free " slogan in the gate to a nazi concentration camp in dachau near munich over the years , germany has erected some 3,500 memorials for the victims of national socialism .
in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .
and with public funds for remembrance policies continuing to shrink , it is unlikely berlin will be able to invest in many more memorials - at least not for the time being . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .

thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .
but critics insist the concept unreasonably equates the tyranny of the two regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke the plan 's architect , cdu bundestag member günter nooke , a former civil rights activist and dissident in east germany , plays down the political implications .
" it 's ridiculous to say this implies a shift change in the politics of memory , " he insists .
" anyone who says it does , has n't read the motion . " according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .
" anything that suggests we are relativizing our past can only damage germany 's reputation , " she said . angry protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past the infamous " work makes you free " slogan in the gate to a nazi concentration camp in dachau near munich over the years , germany has erected some 3,500 memorials for the victims of national socialism .
in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .
and with public funds for remembrance policies continuing to shrink , it is unlikely berlin will be able to invest in many more memorials - at least not for the time being . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .
" that really was a hard game , we had to fight to the end , " van nistelrooy said . after beating latvia 2-1 earlier in the day , the czech republic now top group d. the czechs will next face holland on june 19 , the same day germany will take on latvia . lineups : germany : oliver kahn ; arne friedrich , christian wörns , jens nowotny , philipp lahm , frank baumann , bernd schneider , dietmar hamann , michael ballack , torsten frings , kevin kuranyi . netherlands : edwin van der sar ; johnny heitinga , jaap stam , wilfred bouma , giovanni van bronckhorst , phillip cocu , edgar davids , boudewijn zenden , rafael van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy , andy van der meyde . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany meets holland for soccer showdown when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland .

thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .
but critics insist the concept unreasonably equates the tyranny of the two regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke the plan 's architect , cdu bundestag member günter nooke , a former civil rights activist and dissident in east germany , plays down the political implications .
" it 's ridiculous to say this implies a shift change in the politics of memory , " he insists .
" anyone who says it does , has n't read the motion . " according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .
" anything that suggests we are relativizing our past can only damage germany 's reputation , " she said . angry protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past the infamous " work makes you free " slogan in the gate to a nazi concentration camp in dachau near munich over the years , germany has erected some 3,500 memorials for the victims of national socialism .
in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .
and with public funds for remembrance policies continuing to shrink , it is unlikely berlin will be able to invest in many more memorials - at least not for the time being . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .

" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .
" that really was a hard game , we had to fight to the end , " van nistelrooy said . after beating latvia 2-1 earlier in the day , the czech republic now top group d. the czechs will next face holland on june 19 , the same day germany will take on latvia . lineups : germany : oliver kahn ; arne friedrich , christian wörns , jens nowotny , philipp lahm , frank baumann , bernd schneider , dietmar hamann , michael ballack , torsten frings , kevin kuranyi . netherlands : edwin van der sar ; johnny heitinga , jaap stam , wilfred bouma , giovanni van bronckhorst , phillip cocu , edgar davids , boudewijn zenden , rafael van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy , andy van der meyde . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany meets holland for soccer showdown when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland .

"
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .

" anyone who says it does , has n't read the motion . " according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .

in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .

the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
a second failure would have made it difficult for further european unity and legislation , since the constitution was drafted with enlargement in mind , and it would have further alienated brussels from europe 's citizens . dw staff -lrb- dsl and dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans back eu constitution compromise eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings .

the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
a second failure would have made it difficult for further european unity and legislation , since the constitution was drafted with enlargement in mind , and it would have further alienated brussels from europe 's citizens . dw staff -lrb- dsl and dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans back eu constitution compromise eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .
" that really was a hard game , we had to fight to the end , " van nistelrooy said . after beating latvia 2-1 earlier in the day , the czech republic now top group d. the czechs will next face holland on june 19 , the same day germany will take on latvia . lineups : germany : oliver kahn ; arne friedrich , christian wörns , jens nowotny , philipp lahm , frank baumann , bernd schneider , dietmar hamann , michael ballack , torsten frings , kevin kuranyi . netherlands : edwin van der sar ; johnny heitinga , jaap stam , wilfred bouma , giovanni van bronckhorst , phillip cocu , edgar davids , boudewijn zenden , rafael van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy , andy van der meyde . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany meets holland for soccer showdown when the whistle blows for kick-off tonight , millions of germans will be transfixed as they watch their national team take on arch rival and match favorite holland .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .
that would leave germany and holland scrapping for the last qualifying spot in the group . netherlands -lrb- probable -rrb- : van der sar , heitinga , bouma , stam , van bronckhorst , sneijder , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .

holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .
that would leave germany and holland scrapping for the last qualifying spot in the group . netherlands -lrb- probable -rrb- : van der sar , heitinga , bouma , stam , van bronckhorst , sneijder , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy .

the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .

the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
a second failure would have made it difficult for further european unity and legislation , since the constitution was drafted with enlargement in mind , and it would have further alienated brussels from europe 's citizens . dw staff -lrb- dsl and dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans back eu constitution compromise eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings .

thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .

" it 's ridiculous to say this implies a shift change in the politics of memory , " he insists .
" anyone who says it does , has n't read the motion . " according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .
" anything that suggests we are relativizing our past can only damage germany 's reputation , " she said . angry protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past the infamous " work makes you free " slogan in the gate to a nazi concentration camp in dachau near munich over the years , germany has erected some 3,500 memorials for the victims of national socialism .
in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2004 examining eu-russian relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two presidents : russia 's vladimir putin and the eu 's romano prodi the eu is russia 's number one trading partner , and russia is the bloc 's main supplier of oil .
but the author of a new book argues that the relationship has some fundamental flaws . katinka barysch is a critic of eu-russian relations : she says they wo n't get much better until the political and economic direction of russia becomes clearer . " as long as russia is unsure about whether it is going to the direction of a democracy and a liberal market economy or not , it will be very difficult for the eu to have a much better relationship with the russians , " barysch , who recently presented her book on eu-russia relations . but optimists point to proven progress in eu-russian relations , despite the lack of democracy and a market economy .
for example , at the end of may , the two sides agreed to russia 's entry into the world trade organization . richard wright , the head of the eu delegation in moscow , is one of those optimists . " i think the authors underestimate what has been achieved , and the starting point , which was after all very different , " he said . will eu constitution help ? only fifteen years ago , russia and the european union were bitter political enemies with radically different economic systems .

barysch thinks an eu constitution would make it all much easier . " we 'd have a foreign minister that would probably bring more cohesion to foreign policy , and we would get rid of the rotating presidency and get rid of this activism and inertia cycle and all the initiatives which get started every six months , " said barysch , who works as chief economist at the center for european reform in london and runs the organization 's russia program . she added that because individual eu countries like france and germany do n't always tow the eu line , russia views europe as divided . wright on the other hand points to the 1997 eu-russian partnership and co-operation agreement : europe and russia are trying , however imperfectly , to build common space where they work together on justice , security , and education . " step by step we are building more confidence and trust which i think is the key to partnership , " he said . both the critics and the optimists agree that there are at least some problems in the relationship , but no all out crisis . and both agree that it should never come to that , because the two sides are too important for each other . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu assesses ties with russia the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .

"
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .

in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .

the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .
the atmosphere in the team is good . " latvia -lrb- probable -rrb- : kolinko , isakovs , zemlinskis , stepanovs , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , astafjevs , laizans , rubins , verpakovskis , pahars .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .
the atmosphere in the team is good . " latvia -lrb- probable -rrb- : kolinko , isakovs , zemlinskis , stepanovs , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , astafjevs , laizans , rubins , verpakovskis , pahars .

but the author of a new book argues that the relationship has some fundamental flaws . katinka barysch is a critic of eu-russian relations : she says they wo n't get much better until the political and economic direction of russia becomes clearer . " as long as russia is unsure about whether it is going to the direction of a democracy and a liberal market economy or not , it will be very difficult for the eu to have a much better relationship with the russians , " barysch , who recently presented her book on eu-russia relations . but optimists point to proven progress in eu-russian relations , despite the lack of democracy and a market economy .
for example , at the end of may , the two sides agreed to russia 's entry into the world trade organization . richard wright , the head of the eu delegation in moscow , is one of those optimists .

barysch thinks an eu constitution would make it all much easier .

german goalkeeper oliver kahn is faced with a difficult choice in the euro 2004 game against latvia tonight : he can either help his team stay in the championships or take up an offer of honorary latvian citizenship . family ties might already make it possible for kahn to obtain a passport from the baltic country : after all , his paternal grandmother was latvian and his father was born there . but latvia 's ambassador to germany thought he might at least try to convince kahn to help the latvian team score at least one goal . " actually , we do n't have a chance in the match , " martin virsis told german tabloid bild .
" but if kahn makes mistakes and we advance , we 'll make him an honorary citizen . " virsis also tried to encourage kahn with another statement : " in latvia , the women are more attractive than in germany . " kahn recently split up with his girlfriend , saying that he wanted to concentrate more on his career .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

german goalkeeper oliver kahn is faced with a difficult choice in the euro 2004 game against latvia tonight : he can either help his team stay in the championships or take up an offer of honorary latvian citizenship . family ties might already make it possible for kahn to obtain a passport from the baltic country : after all , his paternal grandmother was latvian and his father was born there . but latvia 's ambassador to germany thought he might at least try to convince kahn to help the latvian team score at least one goal . " actually , we do n't have a chance in the match , " martin virsis told german tabloid bild .
" but if kahn makes mistakes and we advance , we 'll make him an honorary citizen . " virsis also tried to encourage kahn with another statement : " in latvia , the women are more attractive than in germany . " kahn recently split up with his girlfriend , saying that he wanted to concentrate more on his career .

the countries intend to promote tolerance and mutual understanding in the area of conflict . officials from germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , which partners in the ramallah project , believe that because of the last century of german history , the country is particularly well-qualified to be a moderator between european and palestinian culture . " this is something that is accepted everywhere , that germany has come to terms with its past and has acknowledged the mistakes that it made , " said klaus krischkok , a spokesman for the institute .
" a country that has 50 years of democracy , and 50 years of coming to terms with its own history comes across as more credible . " ramallah is at the center of the palestinian crisis .
palestinian leader yassir arafat has been kept there under virtual house arrest by the israeli army for two and a half years , and the city has been the scene of major israeli military operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , and jutta limbach , who serves as the goethe institute 's president the goethe institute has centers all over the world dedicated to spreading german culture - most recently it opened up a branch in north korea , the nation whose borders are most closed to the outside world . both the west bank and north korea are places of poverty and oppression , with more pressing problems than a lack of european culture . helping to avoid future conflicts but krischkok said that precisely in such regions , it 's wise to channel resources into a goethe institute . " part of german foreign policy is the position of cultural programs , " he said .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .
the atmosphere in the team is good . " latvia -lrb- probable -rrb- : kolinko , isakovs , zemlinskis , stepanovs , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , astafjevs , laizans , rubins , verpakovskis , pahars .

the countries intend to promote tolerance and mutual understanding in the area of conflict . officials from germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , which partners in the ramallah project , believe that because of the last century of german history , the country is particularly well-qualified to be a moderator between european and palestinian culture . " this is something that is accepted everywhere , that germany has come to terms with its past and has acknowledged the mistakes that it made , " said klaus krischkok , a spokesman for the institute .
" a country that has 50 years of democracy , and 50 years of coming to terms with its own history comes across as more credible . " ramallah is at the center of the palestinian crisis .
palestinian leader yassir arafat has been kept there under virtual house arrest by the israeli army for two and a half years , and the city has been the scene of major israeli military operations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , and jutta limbach , who serves as the goethe institute 's president the goethe institute has centers all over the world dedicated to spreading german culture - most recently it opened up a branch in north korea , the nation whose borders are most closed to the outside world . both the west bank and north korea are places of poverty and oppression , with more pressing problems than a lack of european culture . helping to avoid future conflicts but krischkok said that precisely in such regions , it 's wise to channel resources into a goethe institute . " part of german foreign policy is the position of cultural programs , " he said .
" simply because culture , education , dialogue have a certain function in promoting tolerance , promoting mutual understanding , which will help to eventually avoid future conflicts and that , i think , is a good investment . " along with the goethe institute , the french cultural organization centre culturel francais is helping to open the center , which is funded by the european union and the french-german television station arte . both sides are making it clear that their function is not only to transmit their national cultures , but also " european culture " - a problematic task , because europe is full of various cultures , languages , and political points of view . radical differences between europe and places like north korea or the west bank further complicate the exchange . " in the special case of germany and korea , there have been relatively strong links between north korea and the german democratic republic , " he said .
" these links have been pretty much cut for the last 15 years , since the gdr ceased to exist , but there are people who speak german , read german . in the case of the palestinian territories , there 's a sizeable community of palestinian immigrants in germany . " the west bank facility will be heavily guarded , as are most western installations in the middle east . however , goethe institute officials stressed that it will be open to the public . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goethe institute opens center in north korea with the opening of its reading room in pyongyang , germany ’ s goethe institute has become the first western cultural organization to open shop in north korea .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .
the atmosphere in the team is good . " latvia -lrb- probable -rrb- : kolinko , isakovs , zemlinskis , stepanovs , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , astafjevs , laizans , rubins , verpakovskis , pahars .
germany -lrb- probable -rrb- : kahn , friedrich , worns , nowotny , lahm ; baumann , schneider -lrb- or schweinsteiger -rrb- , ballack , hamann ; frings , kuranyi . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .
as play restarted the pace slowed , but the dutch eventually began to assert more control over the match . as the dutch pushed forward , german keeper oliver kahn was forced to make a few saves .
marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2004 european leaders agree on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the document can take effect in 2006 at the earliest after more than a year of back and forth , european leaders approved the constitution that will serve as the blueprint for the future direction of the eu . european leaders managed to find enough common ground to approve the text of europe 's first-ever constitution late on friday night .
the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .
a second failure would have made it difficult for further european unity and legislation , since the constitution was drafted with enlargement in mind , and it would have further alienated brussels from europe 's citizens . dw staff -lrb- dsl and dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans back eu constitution compromise eu leaders meeting at a summit in brussels inch closer to an agreement on europe 's first constitution , but disagreements over the future president of the european commission have clouded the meetings .

the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.06.2004 examining eu-russian relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two presidents : russia 's vladimir putin and the eu 's romano prodi the eu is russia 's number one trading partner , and russia is the bloc 's main supplier of oil .
but the author of a new book argues that the relationship has some fundamental flaws . katinka barysch is a critic of eu-russian relations : she says they wo n't get much better until the political and economic direction of russia becomes clearer . " as long as russia is unsure about whether it is going to the direction of a democracy and a liberal market economy or not , it will be very difficult for the eu to have a much better relationship with the russians , " barysch , who recently presented her book on eu-russia relations . but optimists point to proven progress in eu-russian relations , despite the lack of democracy and a market economy .
for example , at the end of may , the two sides agreed to russia 's entry into the world trade organization . richard wright , the head of the eu delegation in moscow , is one of those optimists . " i think the authors underestimate what has been achieved , and the starting point , which was after all very different , " he said . will eu constitution help ? only fifteen years ago , russia and the european union were bitter political enemies with radically different economic systems .
but the critic barysch looks at the problems of today : for example , russians need a visa to enter the eu . and russia just recently agreed to lift a ban on meat imports from eu countries .
barysch thinks an eu constitution would make it all much easier . " we 'd have a foreign minister that would probably bring more cohesion to foreign policy , and we would get rid of the rotating presidency and get rid of this activism and inertia cycle and all the initiatives which get started every six months , " said barysch , who works as chief economist at the center for european reform in london and runs the organization 's russia program . she added that because individual eu countries like france and germany do n't always tow the eu line , russia views europe as divided . wright on the other hand points to the 1997 eu-russian partnership and co-operation agreement : europe and russia are trying , however imperfectly , to build common space where they work together on justice , security , and education . " step by step we are building more confidence and trust which i think is the key to partnership , " he said . both the critics and the optimists agree that there are at least some problems in the relationship , but no all out crisis . and both agree that it should never come to that , because the two sides are too important for each other . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu assesses ties with russia the european commission has called for frank discussions between the eu and russia on " all issues of concern , " including human rights and chechnya .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .
although the czech 's lead the group with the only win , their goal difference is meagre .
germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .
the score in porto on saturday will be all important in both instances . völler knows germany must claim the victory but he is not considering the margin .
" we accept we are the favourites but talking about goal difference would be foolish , " he said .
" first of all we have to win the game and that will not be easy .
latvia is not here by accident . " latvia identifies german weakness the latvians scared the czechs by going a goal in front on june 15 in aviero by combating the threat of nedved , koller and baros with marauding and maverick counter-attacking moves .
now latvia coach aleksandrs starkovs says he has studied his next opponents in much the same way as he prepared for the czech republic and has apparently pinpointed germany 's weaknesses . " every team has some minuses , " the latvia coach said .
" we tried to exploit them against the czech republic and we will also do so against germany .
they are very strong and their style of play is quite different from the czechs .
it will be a tough game . " we have to come up with something to neutralise bobic and kevin kuranyi - they are very dangerous forwards , " starkovs told reporters .
" we will change our tactics but i am not going to tell you how . " " we have already proved that we can make life difficult for the favourites . " czech loss is incentive , says coach the latvian coach echoed the words of his german counterpart by warning germany that his players were fired up by their disappointing loss against the czech and were ready to show what they were made of . " of course we were disappointed because the players did n't come to portugal just to make up the numbers , " said starkovs .
" however , the negative feelings are going away with every day .
the atmosphere in the team is good . " latvia -lrb- probable -rrb- : kolinko , isakovs , zemlinskis , stepanovs , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , astafjevs , laizans , rubins , verpakovskis , pahars .
germany -lrb- probable -rrb- : kahn , friedrich , worns , nowotny , lahm ; baumann , schneider -lrb- or schweinsteiger -rrb- , ballack , hamann ; frings , kuranyi . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

germany could leap-frog them into first place , at least for a couple of hours , with a win but the amount of goals scored could be the deciding factor when it comes to the final day of the group stage .

germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over . germany faces a potential pitfall in the group d clash with latvia on saturday in porto .
the germans , who stuttered against so-called lesser opposition in the qualifying rounds before eventually limping their way to portugal , face a stern test against the latvians who proved against the czech republic that they neither fear nor respect big reputations . coach rudi völler knows exactly what his charges are capable of against international minnows and has urged germany to eclipse their draw against holland in the first game with an attacking display which destroys the challenge of latvia .
" we 'll have more possession and we need to take more initiative , to be more dangerous in front of goal , " he said . optimism to be kept under control despite failing to win the opening game after leading 1-0 , germany has received good support from home and the fans seem satisfied after the shaky pre-tournament results against lesser teams .
" i know everybody back home is satisfied and it 's good that people believe we can do well , but so far we have not won anything , " völler told a press conference with a cautious tone to his voice . the group of death is currently in a tight state with few points and few goals to spare between the four teams involved .

the leaders did put off naming a new president of the executive commission to replace outgoing european commission president romano prodi .
the differences on the decision underscored tensions between britain , france and germany that remain on the future course of the eu .
" no candidate has emerged yet , but last night there were about 10 names around , so it 's not so unusual when there are so many candidates around that none of them has sufficient support , " said irish premier bertie ahern , who holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of the month .
he added that he hoped to convene a special meeting within the next two weeks to resolve the question of who would become the next eu commission president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker belgian premier guy verhofstadt , who had been france and germany 's candidate for the position , wirthdrew himself as a candidate on friday .
eu 's external affairs commissioner , chris patten , a conservative brit who is supported by the european people 's party , the largest political bloc in the european parliament , also dropped out .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is considered to be a candidate that could be accepted by everyone , continues to say that he 's not interested in the position .
" historic decision " common ground was finally found on the constitution , however .
the group of 25 eu member state leaders reached a consensus on the stickiest issue : the amount of votes member states would get in the council of ministers .
under the new proposal , submitted by the irish presidency , at least 15 member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population will have to support decision for them to take effect .
in order to block proposals , at least four states representing 35 percent of the population will have to come join forces .
bildunterschrift : european familiy picture : heads of state and government say " cheese " after agreeing on an eu constitution spain , who together with poland put up vehement opposition to the previous voting system , said it was satisfied with the final text .
poland apparently pulled back a last-minute protest over the fact that god was not mentioned in the constitution 's preamble .
germany satisfied with outcome german chancellor gerhard schröder was very satisfied with the outcome , calling it " a historic decision " for europe .
" i believe one can say that , all in all , it is legitimate to be pleased , " he added .
german negotiators were able to get a line in the constitution that allowed the eu only to take over decisions that they can decide on better than member states .
it was part of their push to get eu decision-making in the areas of domestic and justice policies , foreign policy , economic policy and finance policy , to be simplified .
britain initially protested those suggestions , demanding that it retain its so-called " red line " veto .
germany also succeeded in pushing through its demands vis-a-vis the stability and growth pact , the accord that ensures the security of the euro .
under the compromise , eu finance ministers would have the ability to stop the european commission from taking legal action against countries that violate the pact 's 3 percent deficit spending ceiling by a qualified majority vote .
the irish presidency set the cooperative tone earlier this week with the battle cry : failure is not an option .
the constitution has been held in a state of purgatory since it was outright rejected by spain and poland in december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.06.2004 germans mull controversial memorial concept großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now a private museum : east germany 's stasi headquarters a recent proposal for a nationwide " memorial concept " to jointly honor victims of the soviet occupation , the east german regime as well as victims of the nazis has unleashed a storm of protest . the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- chose the day carefully .
thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .
but critics insist the concept unreasonably equates the tyranny of the two regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter nooke the plan 's architect , cdu bundestag member günter nooke , a former civil rights activist and dissident in east germany , plays down the political implications .
" it 's ridiculous to say this implies a shift change in the politics of memory , " he insists .
" anyone who says it does , has n't read the motion . " according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .
" anything that suggests we are relativizing our past can only damage germany 's reputation , " she said . angry protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man walks past the infamous " work makes you free " slogan in the gate to a nazi concentration camp in dachau near munich over the years , germany has erected some 3,500 memorials for the victims of national socialism .
in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .
and with public funds for remembrance policies continuing to shrink , it is unlikely berlin will be able to invest in many more memorials - at least not for the time being . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the cold war 's forgotten heroes june 17 , 1953 ?

neither has half of germany .
but on the 50th anniversary of the massive uprising against a communist regime , a reunited germany is seeking to refresh the collective memory .

thursday was the 51st anniversary of the worker 's uprising in east berlin on june 17 , 1953 .
it seemed like a fitting date to introduce what has proven to be a highly inflammatory plan . the controversial motion outlined in the bundestag , germany 's parliament , foresees the government combining funding of memorials for victims of the nazis and east germany 's communist dictatorship , and managing and funding the sites as " memorials of exceptional national significance . "
these could include former nazi concentration camps as well as sites such as the former east german state security , or stasi , headquarters in berlin . a bad comparison ? given germany 's deeply troubled relationship with its past , a debate was inevitable . the opposition dismissed the subsequent claims that their plan puts the post-world war ii communist regime on equal footing with the third reich .

" according to associated press , nooke maintains that " remembering the victims of the 20th century 's two totalitarian regimes , nazism and communism , is one of the elements of a reunited germany . " a " singular crime " after withdrawing his first motion outlining a " broad concept based on a dignified remembrance of all victims of germany 's two dictatorships " in early january , nooke reworded the proposal to include a clause stating that the nazi 's murder of millions of jews " was a singular crime which will always occupy a unique place in our memory . " salomon korn , vice-chairman of the jewish central committee , told the berlin daily tageszeitung that " the added sentence is not enough , " and he objected to what he described as an inadmissible obfuscation and parallel-drawing . chancellor gerhard schröder 's state secretary for media and culture , christina weiss , demanded that the cdu recall the application .

in contrast , the victims of the 44-year history of political persecution in the soviet occupation zone and the german democratic republic are commemorated with just 350 monuments .
but nooke 's request that the government overhaul its distribution of funds has triggered an international outcry .
albert meyer , head of berlin 's jewish community , told the berliner zeitung that " the concept must be thrown out , " while avner shalev , chairman of the central israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem , called the proposal " an affront to historical truth " and wrote an open letter to cdu leader angela merkel urging her to reconsider the motion .
but nooke and his supporters say that more attention needs to be paid to the dark chapter of german history that followed world war ii .
in an interview with german daily die welt , nooke stressed it was unacceptable that " nazi memorials are granted funding while soviet occupation zone and german democratic republic memorials are not . " for the time being , the bundestag has deferred a vote on the opposition 's motion .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .
that would leave germany and holland scrapping for the last qualifying spot in the group . netherlands -lrb- probable -rrb- : van der sar , heitinga , bouma , stam , van bronckhorst , sneijder , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van der vaart , ruud van nistelrooy .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .

marc overmars came in for boudewijn zenden and placed his first shot so that kahn , who celebrated his 35th birthday on tuesday , had to leap athletically to punch it away . then just as the germans were daring to believe they could wait out the 90 minutes , andy van der meyde won the ball near the right corner and sent a beautiful cross into the box . van nistelrooy managed to horizontally connect to put the ball behind kahn in the 81st minute . " when you are up for so long , a draw is frustrating , especially since we played very well in the first half and had the dutch under control , " said germany coach rudi völler . though the result was likely bitter for the germans , at least they managed to earn the respect of their traditional rivals .

the czech republic can qualify for the quarter-finals on saturday if they beat the dutch in aviero .
holland will need to show more quality if they wish to remain in euro 2004 . far from being the epitome of total football and a performance that drew sharp criticism from some of holland 's biggest soccer names , the draw against germany on june 15 taught the oranje one thing : more quality is required if this current dutch team is to add to the legacy of their country 's soccer heritage . one player who will feel the barbs from the likes of johann cruyff and louis van gaal more than most will be the man who carried the dutch attack and the man who saved their first game with his late equalizer : ruud van nistlerooy .
the manchester united forward cut a frustrated and lonely figure as the spearhead of a lacklustre dutch team who rarely showed any of the magic that the team has conjured in previous incarnations . dutch look to improve " we need to build on our performance against germany which was not very good , " said van nistlerooy ahead of the all-important clash with fellow fancied contenders the czech republic in aviero on saturday .
" the czechs are well organised and will not leave much space to be creative . " defender jaap stam , who was among the dutch rearguard against germany , admitted that his was relishing his potential contest with giant striker jan koller , saying : " he is always a tough opponent , controlling and holding the ball well . " the two " man mountains " will be key in the fortunes of their teams when they come head-to-head .
the czech attacker will look to exploit the milan defender 's penchant for losing concentration while stam will know that the snuffing out the danger posed by the dortmund striker will rid the czech 's of their target man . advocaat changes tack and defends players coach dick advocaat , another of the dutch voice who offered far from complementary words for his players even though they came from behind against germany , changed his tune when faced with questions from the floor at the team 's recent press conference .
" i do not understand why we were judged to have played badly , " he said .
" it was germany 's best performance in two years , so i think it was a good result . " we were nervous against the germans , but i hope that nervousness will lessen as the tournament progresses . "
" i can not say whether i 'll select the side that played well in the second half against germany because i have to take the whole match into account , " the dutch coach told the euro 2004 official web site . " the team did n't get better because of the substitutions but because they showed more guts .
they also showed more aggression when they were 1-0 down . " he added : " we may not have the best team in the championship , but we always enter a tournament with intentions of winning it .
we 've only played one game , one draw , so everything is still open for us . " czechs wary of van nistlerooy the czechs have highlighted the threat of van nistlerooy as the main danger and believe that if the striker is once more isolated in saturday 's game then they stand a good chance of winning the match .
" he 's lethal inside the area as he showed with that strike against germany , " said liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer who has regularly faced the manchester united icon in the english premiership . " it was barely a half chance - just the kind of goal he specializes in . " baros to inflict more damage , says smicer however , smicer warned the dutch not to underestimate the talents of his anfield team-mate milan baros .
" he is our best striker at the moment .
milan has scored four goals in his last three internationals so he is in very good form . " the czechs lead the group with three points after coming from behind to beat latvia 2-1 and can reach the quarter-finals with victory over the dutch .

german goalkeeper oliver kahn is faced with a difficult choice in the euro 2004 game against latvia tonight : he can either help his team stay in the championships or take up an offer of honorary latvian citizenship . family ties might already make it possible for kahn to obtain a passport from the baltic country : after all , his paternal grandmother was latvian and his father was born there . but latvia 's ambassador to germany thought he might at least try to convince kahn to help the latvian team score at least one goal . " actually , we do n't have a chance in the match , " martin virsis told german tabloid bild .
" but if kahn makes mistakes and we advance , we 'll make him an honorary citizen . " virsis also tried to encourage kahn with another statement : " in latvia , the women are more attractive than in germany . " kahn recently split up with his girlfriend , saying that he wanted to concentrate more on his career .

as the world looks to portugal and euro 2004 , organizations campaigning against sweatshop conditions for workers making sportswear in developing countries are stepping up the pressure . it 's warming up to be the biggest clash of the european championships but it wo n't be contested on the field of play but in the marketplace and it wo n't be the soccer skills of those involved that will win the game but the moral standards of those who watch it .
the giants of the sportswear world are going head-to-head with charities and human rights organisations in a battle for the hearts and minds of consumers .
on one side are the mega-money galacticos of adidas , nike , reebok and puma who have pulled out all their marketing stops to persuade shoppers to snap up euro 2004-branded merchandise without them worrying about the ethical problems surrounding the lives of the factory workers who made it .
in opposition are the shoestring players of non-governmental organisations such as oxfam , the clean clothes campaign and global unions who are accusing the labels of violating the rights of millions of workers in favour of huge profits during the soccer showpiece in portugal and the upcoming olympic games in athens later this summer .
the global market for sportswear goods is estimated to generate at least -lrb- $ 58 billion -rrb- per year . with the european championships already underway , the charities are stepping up their campaigns as the world 's eyes turn to these international sporting events .
“ problems are endemic in this industry .
we 've been shocked by very low wages and long working hours , ” adrie papma , who heads the workers rights project , recently told reporters .
" workers are being pushed to the limit so that firms can get their goods on the shelves in time . "
eighteen hours a day the organizations have compiled a report on the state of working conditions which cites examples such as an indonesian factory where workers took home $ 99 per month , covering only half of basic living costs , and where employees worked 16 to 18 hours a day , six days in a row . the publication of the report comes as nearly half a million people flood into portugal for euro 2004 , many looking for branded souvenirs to commemorate their involvement in europe 's largest soccer event .
as a result , the sports companies have gone on the defensive in a bid to protect the huge amounts of business they expect to garner from a bumper period of sporting activity .
the firms , who manufacture in developing countries to keep costs down , now face an embarrassing resurrection of a long-running debate which regularly generates tough questions and occasional protests at annual shareholders ' meetings . the big guns such as nike , reebok , adidas , puma and umbro all have fixed rules on wages , working conditions and the age of workers .
they insist that they carry out random checks on factory floors to check that codes of conduct are being enforced . " our day-to-day work is going to the factories unannounced and checking standards , " said reiner hengstmann , puma 's global head of social and environmental affairs in response to the claims , adding that puma had seven employees doing the spot checks . “ we do n't have child labor as a problem .
we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record . "
another area where the rules and standards are difficult to enforce is that of under-age workers and the proving of employees ' ages .
nike , the global leader in sports shoes manufacture , has insisted on previous occasions that company officials insist that workers must be 16 in its clothing factories and 18 in footwear factories but says this goal can be hindered by false age records and younger workers already employed by a new supplier . the human rights groups have conceded that since the big companies have introduced their own standards , there has been progress made , albeit very slow progress .
and despite their protests , there is one thing the charities can not dispute : the controversial factories which turn out the merchandise for sporting events like euro 2004 are a lifeline both for the workers and entire countries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shopping in the name of soccer just a few weeks before kick-off , german companies are launching euro 2004-related deals designed to lure customers into spending some cash in the name of the beautiful game .

we deal with hours of work , overtime and wages . ” umbro , which provides playing and training equipment for the england and sweden teams and a number of domestic league sides across the continent , also moved to smother human rights concerns by issuing its own statement : “ the factory in china which makes the england replica kit is of an incredibly high standard and is the envy of many in the industry , ” the statement read .
reality gap the two sides , however , agree on one thing : there can be a big gap between written codes and the reality of factory life . frank henke , adidas 's director of social and environmental affairs , told reporters earlier this month that more than half of its suppliers did not meet what he called “ best practice ” . he added : " we will not work with such firms unless they show they are improving their record .

the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw . the stadium in porto was covered in a sea of orange-wearing dutch supporters , who outnumbered german fans three to one .
but that and the star-packed dutch squad did n't intimidate the german players , as they immediately took the fight to their opponents . in the first opening minutes both sides pushed forward , but the germans quickly managed to get the upper hand and increase the pressure on the dutch defenders .
it was a surprisingly strong performance for a german side that was considered average at best by many observers . then philipp lahm was fouled by the dutch captain philip cocu on the left flank resulting in a yellow card for the dutchman and a free kick for the germans .
that set up the german goal in the 30th minute as torsten frings put the ball past teammate bernd schneider , a number of dutch defenders and the keeper edwin van der sar . bildunterschrift : the dutch began to fade somewhat after the germans took the lead and dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy had few chances as halftime came .

the gem is selling well in the us and europe the gem comes in either a two or four-seater version and has a range of about 40 miles between charges .
the uk importer , zev ltd , is confident of selling about 350 gems in the next 18 months .
" the main advantage of this vehicle is that the whole-life cost is incredibly low , " zev 's managing director , alex bamberg told bbc news online .
" you 're talking about 0.25p a mile to run it , while a petrol vehicle costs around 30p a mile . "
after paying a one-off registration fee of £ 38 , the gem will be exempt from road tax .
the car will also be free of london 's congestion charge and , according to zev , many boroughs will allow free parking in meter bays .
flexible design it has the ability to carry a wheelchair on the back and it 's pretty flexible alex bamberg , zev more highlights from the mobility roadshow zev is keen to highlight the car 's accessibility features , hence its debut at the mobility roadshow at donnington park - an exhibition of various transport-related products aimed at disabled people , which ends on saturday .
" the gem has a 1.5m door opening , it 's quite low to the ground , has great headroom and space to move around , " said mr bamberg .
" it has the ability to carry a wheelchair on the back and it 's pretty flexible . "
the company says that the car can be made more accessible by adding features like hand controls .
the two seater version will retail for just under £ 7000 while the four seater will cost £ 1000 more .
the gem is low to the ground and has ample head room there are also short and long pick-ups available at a similar cost to the saloon .
the car can be supplied with a range of coloured body panels , and the doors can easily be removed in a matter of minutes - features that are likely to appeal to image conscious city dwellers .
although a right-hand drive option is available , left-hand drive is standard which will mean that disabled drivers will be able to get behind the wheel from the kerb-side .
with a top speed of about 30mph and a charge time of seven hours , it lacks the flexibility of a fuel-burning vehicle .
but if the majority of journeys are short and predictable it may well find a market among environmentally conscious motorists .

the 31-year-old saudi national took up the extremist cause as a teenager and is believed to have trained with fellow saudi osama bin laden .
driven by hatred of saudi arabia 's pro-us monarchy , he led a series of recent attacks to destabilise the country .
his group claimed responsibility for killing us hostage paul johnson .
muqrin , saudi arabia 's most wanted man , is believed to have earned his credentials as a fighter in soviet-occupied afghanistan .
much later , he was involved in the taleban 's battle against us-led forces there .
reward muqrin also fought in algeria , bosnia , and the horn of africa .
he was captured in ethiopia in the late 1990s while fighting alongside somali separatists and extradited to saudi arabia where he was sentenced to four years in prison .
but this was cut in half as a reward for memorising the koran .
muqrin is believed to have been the mastermind behind a suicide bombing at a housing compound in riyadh in november last year , which killed 17 people .
his fighters have also been blamed for a series of increasingly bloody attacks in saudi arabia , including a siege in khobar last month that left 22 people dead .
muqrin 's group , calling itself the " al-qaeda organisation in the arabian peninsula " posted a video on an islamist website last tuesday , threatening to kill american paul johnson if al-qaeda prisoners were not released from saudi jails .
three days later , the same group posted another video , showing that their threat had been carried out .
mr johnson was the third american killed in riyadh in the past 10 days .
described as a smart and brutal tactician , muqrin was said to have lived in the riyadh district of al-suwaydi , home to many of saudi arabia 's most-wanted militants .
bbc cameraman simon cumbers was killed and security correspondent frank gardner seriously injured in a drive-by shooting while working there on 6 june .

this follows news that group 4 had sold its firm , global solutions ltd -lrb- gsl -rrb- , which runs the bedfordshire centre for the home office .
liberal democrat lord avebury said the home office had little say on the deal .
he wants to make sure recommendations made in a recent report on the centre are implemented by the new firm .
lord avebury , a former liberal spokesman on immigration who has an interest in prison issues , is concerned about the 29 recommendations put forward in a report by prison ombudsman stephen shaw . "
the home office should have some say in the process , or evaluate it or impose conditions " lord avebury he told bbc news online new rules should be brought in to allow the home office to put forward conditions that new companies would have to meet if they wanted to take over running detention centres or prisons .
in this case the conditions would be imposed on englefield capital and electra partners europe who bought gsl from group 4 .
" the home office should have some say in the process , or evaluate it or impose conditions , " he said .
lord avebury said regulation may be required because although private finance deals may bring in good management experts , there had been " some cutting of corners " in the past , with thing being done " cheaply " .
control and restraint a spokesman for the home office said : " immigration officials are working with gsl to implement all the recommendations of the prison ombudsman 's report . "
he added : " the change of ownership of the contractor does not affect our contract with them or the way we monitor their obligations . "
a spokesman for gsl said the implementation of the report was a home office issue and englefield capital was unavailable for comment on friday .
a prison ombudsman 's inquiry in may this year found allegations of racism and abusive language by some staff at yarl 's wood detention centre in bedfordshire were substantiated .
control and restraint techniques were more commonly used than at other centres , mr shaw said .
but he found no evidence that there was a culture of abuse , racism or violence at the facility .

in this case the conditions would be imposed on englefield capital and electra partners europe who bought gsl from group 4 .
" the home office should have some say in the process , or evaluate it or impose conditions , " he said .
lord avebury said regulation may be required because although private finance deals may bring in good management experts , there had been " some cutting of corners " in the past , with thing being done " cheaply " .
control and restraint a spokesman for the home office said : " immigration officials are working with gsl to implement all the recommendations of the prison ombudsman 's report . "
he added : " the change of ownership of the contractor does not affect our contract with them or the way we monitor their obligations . "
a spokesman for gsl said the implementation of the report was a home office issue and englefield capital was unavailable for comment on friday .
a prison ombudsman 's inquiry in may this year found allegations of racism and abusive language by some staff at yarl 's wood detention centre in bedfordshire were substantiated .
control and restraint techniques were more commonly used than at other centres , mr shaw said .
but he found no evidence that there was a culture of abuse , racism or violence at the facility .

bbc news online examines how a small gathering of hippies celebrating the summer solstice at stonehenge evolved into the high point of the british counter-cultural calendar .
last year , more than 30,000 people gathered at stonehenge to mark the summer solstice .
but police in wiltshire and neighbouring hampshire warned they would not tolerate any unlicensed " mass gatherings " after the midsummer event .
and officers were out in force to thwart any attempts to hold parties .
andover divisional commander superintendent mark chatterton said : " we are not being killjoys .
the first stonehenge free festival was in 1974 -lrb- c -rrb- austin underwood " we are all in favour of people having a good time , provided the event is properly licensed to ensure that it is safe for everyone . "
stonehenge free festival was never licensed .
and in 1985 - after being banned by english heritage - it became so unsafe that no-one actually reached the ancient stone circle .
phil russell , the orphaned son of a wealthy landowner , and jeremy ratter , who later co-founded the anarcho-punk band crass , staged the first stonehenge free festival during the summer solstice of 1974 .
five hundred hippies climbed a barbed wire fence erected by the ministry of works .
and after the solstice , a hardcore of 30 defied a court injunction to stay - for another six months .
the publicity surrounding their court case ensured the attendance doubled for the solstice the following year .
the battle of the beanfield was seven miles from the stones mr ratter later recalled the 1975 festival : " wood fires , tents and tipis , free food stalls , stages and bands , music and magic ... old friends met new , hands touched , bodies entwined , minds expanded and , in one tiny spot on our earth , love and peace had become a reality . "
but the festival 's co-founder was not there .
arrested for possession of lsd the previous month , mr russell had been committed to a psychiatric hospital .
released immediately after the 10-day festival , he committed suicide weeks later .
mr russell 's ashes were scattered over the stones during the summer solstice of 1976 - by which time , the festival 's attendance had again doubled .
and , fuelled by the myth of martyrdom , the numbers continued to grow at the same rate until 70,000 people attended the 10th annual stonehenge free festival on 21 june 1984 .
it remains the biggest free festival in british history .
but the following year , the annual event 's colourful history came to an abrupt end .
stonehenge was closed to the public at the summer solstice for 15 years and stonehenge remained closed to the public during the summer solstice for the following 15 years .
on 1 june 1985 , 300 would-be festival-goers were arrested - and 12 put in hospital - following a violent confrontation with the police .
five hundred officers from six different forces dropped 15 tons -lrb- 15,041kg -rrb- of gravel onto a road seven miles -lrb- 11.27km -rrb- from the stones , and used council vehicles to block the path of a 140-vehicle convoy travelling to stonehenge .
what happened next is hotly disputed .
the police say they were attacked with lumps of wood , stones and petrol bombs .
but those in the convoy say police " ambushed " their peaceful procession of vehicles - methodically smashing windows , beating people on the head with truncheons as they tried to surrender , dragging women along by their hair , and using sledgehammers to damage the interiors of their coaches .
the 1986 public order act made trespass a criminal offence english heritage had secured a court injunction to prevent 83 named individuals from travelling within a few miles of stonehenge .
but the battle of the beanfield - as it quickly became known - happened outside the jurisdiction of the injunction , and was indicative of a harder line being adopted at the highest level of government against the growing number of hippies spending their summers on the free festival circuit .
every year since margaret thatcher had become prime minister in 1979 , the number of " new-age travellers " had doubled - partly because of the growing number of evictions of squatters in london , historian andy worthington , the author of stonehenge : celebration and subversion , told bbc news online .
and in 1982 , 135 vehicles had left stonehenge free festival and driven to join the women 's peace camp outside the airbase at greenham common , where us cruise missiles were housed .
the self-styled peace convoy had evaded 2,000 police officers to stage their own cosmic counter-cruise carnival behind the base , during which sections of the fence were pulled down , mr worthington told bbc news online .
and from that day on the writing was on the wall .
" thatcher decided to take on the travellers . "
more than 30,000 people gathered to mark last year 's summer solstice mrs thatcher would later tell the commons she was " only too delighted to do anything we can to make life difficult for hippy convoys " , adding that " if the present law is inadequate we will have to introduce fresh law " .
true to her word , the 1986 public order act made trespass a criminal offence and stated : " two people proceeding in a given direction can constitute a procession and can be arrested as a threat to civil order " .
this was the final nail in the coffin of the british free festival movement - effectively stopping the " new-age travellers " and festival-goers in their tracks .
" people split all over the place , " festival photographer alan lodge told bbc news online .
" large numbers went to europe . "
but rather than putting an end to the politicisation of the peace convoy , the battle of the beanfield pushed a significant number of free festival veterans further towards the activism of the emerging anti-globalisation and road protest movements .
at least 30,000 people are expected for this summer 's solstice as mr lodge , who was there , succinctly puts it : " if you have been hit around the head with a truncheon , you do n't feel the same as you did before . "
and by driving the free festival scene underground , the public order act inadvertently paved the way for the numerous illegal rave parties that sprung up in increasingly remote locations during the late 1980s .
today , stonehenge is again at the centre of a bitterly contested conflict .
a plan to build a 1.3 mile -lrb- 2.1km -rrb- tunnel under the world heritage site to reduce traffic congestion has divided opinion .
and with at least 30,000 people expected to converge on stonehenge again for this summer 's solstice - on monday 21 june - the stones seem set to continue to arouse passions on both sides of the cultural divide for at least another 30 years .

bbc news online examines how a small gathering of hippies celebrating the summer solstice at stonehenge evolved into the high point of the british counter-cultural calendar .
last year , more than 30,000 people gathered at stonehenge to mark the summer solstice .
but police in wiltshire and neighbouring hampshire warned they would not tolerate any unlicensed " mass gatherings " after the midsummer event .
and officers were out in force to thwart any attempts to hold parties .
andover divisional commander superintendent mark chatterton said : " we are not being killjoys .
the first stonehenge free festival was in 1974 -lrb- c -rrb- austin underwood " we are all in favour of people having a good time , provided the event is properly licensed to ensure that it is safe for everyone . "
stonehenge free festival was never licensed .
and in 1985 - after being banned by english heritage - it became so unsafe that no-one actually reached the ancient stone circle .
phil russell , the orphaned son of a wealthy landowner , and jeremy ratter , who later co-founded the anarcho-punk band crass , staged the first stonehenge free festival during the summer solstice of 1974 .
five hundred hippies climbed a barbed wire fence erected by the ministry of works .
and after the solstice , a hardcore of 30 defied a court injunction to stay - for another six months .
the publicity surrounding their court case ensured the attendance doubled for the solstice the following year .
the battle of the beanfield was seven miles from the stones mr ratter later recalled the 1975 festival : " wood fires , tents and tipis , free food stalls , stages and bands , music and magic ... old friends met new , hands touched , bodies entwined , minds expanded and , in one tiny spot on our earth , love and peace had become a reality . "
but the festival 's co-founder was not there .
arrested for possession of lsd the previous month , mr russell had been committed to a psychiatric hospital .
released immediately after the 10-day festival , he committed suicide weeks later .
mr russell 's ashes were scattered over the stones during the summer solstice of 1976 - by which time , the festival 's attendance had again doubled .
and , fuelled by the myth of martyrdom , the numbers continued to grow at the same rate until 70,000 people attended the 10th annual stonehenge free festival on 21 june 1984 .
it remains the biggest free festival in british history .
but the following year , the annual event 's colourful history came to an abrupt end .
stonehenge was closed to the public at the summer solstice for 15 years and stonehenge remained closed to the public during the summer solstice for the following 15 years .
on 1 june 1985 , 300 would-be festival-goers were arrested - and 12 put in hospital - following a violent confrontation with the police .
five hundred officers from six different forces dropped 15 tons -lrb- 15,041kg -rrb- of gravel onto a road seven miles -lrb- 11.27km -rrb- from the stones , and used council vehicles to block the path of a 140-vehicle convoy travelling to stonehenge .
what happened next is hotly disputed .
the police say they were attacked with lumps of wood , stones and petrol bombs .
but those in the convoy say police " ambushed " their peaceful procession of vehicles - methodically smashing windows , beating people on the head with truncheons as they tried to surrender , dragging women along by their hair , and using sledgehammers to damage the interiors of their coaches .
the 1986 public order act made trespass a criminal offence english heritage had secured a court injunction to prevent 83 named individuals from travelling within a few miles of stonehenge .
but the battle of the beanfield - as it quickly became known - happened outside the jurisdiction of the injunction , and was indicative of a harder line being adopted at the highest level of government against the growing number of hippies spending their summers on the free festival circuit .
every year since margaret thatcher had become prime minister in 1979 , the number of " new-age travellers " had doubled - partly because of the growing number of evictions of squatters in london , historian andy worthington , the author of stonehenge : celebration and subversion , told bbc news online .
and in 1982 , 135 vehicles had left stonehenge free festival and driven to join the women 's peace camp outside the airbase at greenham common , where us cruise missiles were housed .
the self-styled peace convoy had evaded 2,000 police officers to stage their own cosmic counter-cruise carnival behind the base , during which sections of the fence were pulled down , mr worthington told bbc news online .
and from that day on the writing was on the wall .
" thatcher decided to take on the travellers . "
more than 30,000 people gathered to mark last year 's summer solstice mrs thatcher would later tell the commons she was " only too delighted to do anything we can to make life difficult for hippy convoys " , adding that " if the present law is inadequate we will have to introduce fresh law " .
true to her word , the 1986 public order act made trespass a criminal offence and stated : " two people proceeding in a given direction can constitute a procession and can be arrested as a threat to civil order " .
this was the final nail in the coffin of the british free festival movement - effectively stopping the " new-age travellers " and festival-goers in their tracks .
" people split all over the place , " festival photographer alan lodge told bbc news online .
" large numbers went to europe . "
but rather than putting an end to the politicisation of the peace convoy , the battle of the beanfield pushed a significant number of free festival veterans further towards the activism of the emerging anti-globalisation and road protest movements .
at least 30,000 people are expected for this summer 's solstice as mr lodge , who was there , succinctly puts it : " if you have been hit around the head with a truncheon , you do n't feel the same as you did before . "
and by driving the free festival scene underground , the public order act inadvertently paved the way for the numerous illegal rave parties that sprung up in increasingly remote locations during the late 1980s .
today , stonehenge is again at the centre of a bitterly contested conflict .

it 's a tradition imported from northern ireland which has found a home on the streets of the west of scotland .
this is marching season where the men , women and children of the orange order exercise their " civil and religious rights " .
saturday was juvenile parade day and thousands of followers took to the streets of glasgow and bellshill .
the march came after a sensitive week with calls for the tradition to be banned , or at least restricted .
many communities on the routes of parades claim they feel intimidated , but orangemen say they are misunderstood .
clark fulston is an orangeman in hamilton .
he denies the order provides a home for religious intolerance .
mr fulston said : " i personally have n't come up against anyone in the 15 or 16 years i 've been in the organisation that i could classify as a bigot . "
we think of the 12th of july as a celebration of our civil liberties " clark fulston " as with every organisation there are bad apples in the cart .
we 're not perfect , we do n't claim to be perfect , but we 're trying to move in the right direction , so that we can make our membership more touchy , feely , friendly . "
but that 's not how it seems to some .
the priest at st mary 's roman catholic church in glasgow , peter smith , has called for a ban .
writing in the herald , he described an attempted attack on him and hisses of abuse aimed at his parishioners .
monsignor smith told the newspaper : " if we are truly to incorporate tolerance , respect and diversity into the fabric of our society then we will first of all have to strip out the threads of bile , bigotry and boorishness .
" if that means hanging up the bowler hats and sashes for good , then it is a price worth paying . "
but those wearing the bowler hats feel they are being unfairly labelled .
king william they believe that they are exercising historic rights and are not practitioners of protestant tribalism , but simply celebrating their heritage .
" we think of 12 july as a celebration of our civil liberties , " said clark fulston .
" we are not out there to be triumphalist ... we are out there to celebrate our freedom .
" people see orangeism and they think we do n't like you , people hate you and call you a bigot .
" but it is those people who are intolerant of us - we do n't do the shouting . "
the debate over orange marches is nothing new .
they have been controversial since they started over 200 years ago .
the historical figure of the organisation is king william of orange .
he defeated a catholic uprising in ireland at the battle of the boyne on 12 july 1690 - ironically with the support of the then pope .
but it was a century later before the organisation which takes his name was created .
the orange order has its foundations in another irish rebellion , this time in 1798 .
then , it was formed to defend irish protestants from catholics .
its lodges made their way across the irish sea , courtesy of ulstermen migrating to scotland and ex-servicemen , bringing their new found principles home .
as the years passed the orange order became a popular haven for working class protestant men .
but in recent decades its influence has declined .
the order now estimates its membership to be 50,000 in scotland - almost all in glasgow and lanarkshire .
the scottish executive is now looking at ways of giving more powers to communities which are affected by parades .
an adviser will be appointed in the next month to examine the issue .
many complain that the parades bring with them loutish hangers-on .
modern society this is the biggest problem according to strathclyde police chief superintendent kevin smith .
according to him " the vast majority of marches are well organised and pass off peacefully " .
chief supt smith is in charge of over 120 parades in the east end of glasgow .
he said : " if there is any trouble its from those who accompany the parades who drink and commit public order offences . "
this week on sunday live we discussed if the orange order should have its marches banned and whether it still has any relevance in modern society .
on the programme were the anti-sectarian campaigning msp donald gorrie and ian wilson , the grand master of the orange order in scotland .

orangemen have been marching for centuries it 's a tradition imported from northern ireland which has found a home on the streets of the west of scotland .
this is marching season where the men , women and children of the orange order exercise their " civil and religious rights " .
saturday was juvenile parade day and thousands of followers took to the streets of glasgow and bellshill .
the march came after a sensitive week with calls for the tradition to be banned , or at least restricted .
many communities on the routes of parades claim they feel intimidated , but orangemen say they are misunderstood .
clark fulston is an orangeman in hamilton .
he denies the order provides a home for religious intolerance .
mr fulston said : " i personally have n't come up against anyone in the 15 or 16 years i 've been in the organisation that i could classify as a bigot .

writing in the herald , he described an attempted attack on him and hisses of abuse aimed at his parishioners .
monsignor smith told the newspaper : " if we are truly to incorporate tolerance , respect and diversity into the fabric of our society then we will first of all have to strip out the threads of bile , bigotry and boorishness .

" we are not out there to be triumphalist ... we are out there to celebrate our freedom .

orangemen have been marching for centuries it 's a tradition imported from northern ireland which has found a home on the streets of the west of scotland .
this is marching season where the men , women and children of the orange order exercise their " civil and religious rights " .
saturday was juvenile parade day and thousands of followers took to the streets of glasgow and bellshill .
the march came after a sensitive week with calls for the tradition to be banned , or at least restricted .
many communities on the routes of parades claim they feel intimidated , but orangemen say they are misunderstood .
clark fulston is an orangeman in hamilton .
he denies the order provides a home for religious intolerance .
mr fulston said : " i personally have n't come up against anyone in the 15 or 16 years i 've been in the organisation that i could classify as a bigot .
we think of the 12th of july as a celebration of our civil liberties clark fulston " as with every organisation there are bad apples in the cart .

but that 's not how it seems to some .
the priest at st mary 's roman catholic church in glasgow , peter smith , has called for a ban .
writing in the herald , he described an attempted attack on him and hisses of abuse aimed at his parishioners .
monsignor smith told the newspaper : " if we are truly to incorporate tolerance , respect and diversity into the fabric of our society then we will first of all have to strip out the threads of bile , bigotry and boorishness .
" if that means hanging up the bowler hats and sashes for good , then it is a price worth paying . "
but those wearing the bowler hats feel they are being unfairly labelled .
king william they believe that they are exercising historic rights and are not practitioners of protestant tribalism , but simply celebrating their heritage .
" we think of 12 july as a celebration of our civil liberties , " said clark fulston .
" we are not out there to be triumphalist ... we are out there to celebrate our freedom .
" people see orangeism and they think we do n't like you , people hate you and call you a bigot .
" but it is those people who are intolerant of us - we do n't do the shouting . "
the debate over orange marches is nothing new .
they have been controversial since they started over 200 years ago .
the historical figure of the organisation is king william of orange .
he defeated a catholic uprising in ireland at the battle of the boyne on 12 july 1690 - ironically with the support of the then pope .
but it was a century later before the organisation which takes his name was created .
there are about 50,000 orangemen in scotland the orange order has its foundations in another irish rebellion , this time in 1798 .
then , it was formed to defend irish protestants from catholics .
its lodges made their way across the irish sea , courtesy of ulstermen migrating to scotland and ex-servicemen , bringing their new found principles home .
as the years passed the orange order became a popular haven for working class protestant men .
but in recent decades its influence has declined .
