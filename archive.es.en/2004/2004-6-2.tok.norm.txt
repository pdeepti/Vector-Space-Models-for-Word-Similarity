with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2004 germans struggle with online addiction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it should n't be man 's best friend about 30 million germans use the internet .
experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .
" you do n't realize it , " she said .
" you think that you still have a lot of friends around you . " invisible friends , that is .
friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer . " relatives often become co-dependants , " farke said , adding that it 's a harmful response that 's often recognized too late . miriam beiseler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kids go to camp for internet addiction most people do n't realize that hours spent surfing online could be a symptom of internet addiction disorder .
now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.06.2004 france plans for its energy future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plays an important role in france 's future energy plan nuclear energy still provides france with most of its energy , but the country is looking at alternative sources for the future .
the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2004 germans struggle with online addiction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it should n't be man 's best friend about 30 million germans use the internet .
experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .
" you do n't realize it , " she said .
" you think that you still have a lot of friends around you . " invisible friends , that is .
friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer . " relatives often become co-dependants , " farke said , adding that it 's a harmful response that 's often recognized too late . miriam beiseler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kids go to camp for internet addiction most people do n't realize that hours spent surfing online could be a symptom of internet addiction disorder .
now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2004 eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crude oil rose to $ 42.33 per barrel on tuesday european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .
they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi police close the way to al-khobar petroleum center in khobar , where six people were killed in a terrorist attack this weekend .
opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .

opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .
" you do n't realize it , " she said .
" you think that you still have a lot of friends around you . " invisible friends , that is .
friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer . " relatives often become co-dependants , " farke said , adding that it 's a harmful response that 's often recognized too late . miriam beiseler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kids go to camp for internet addiction most people do n't realize that hours spent surfing online could be a symptom of internet addiction disorder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german carmakers face a bumpy ride german auto industry at risk peter hartz : the father of germany 's labor reforms 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen volkswagen heading for bumpy 2004 ride germany -pipe- 02.06.2004 in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high prices at the pump might soon turn germany into a nation of pedestrians .
with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .
they called on opec to act to calm the market .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .
" you do n't realize it , " she said .
" you think that you still have a lot of friends around you . " invisible friends , that is .
friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .
" you do n't realize it , " she said .
" you think that you still have a lot of friends around you . " invisible friends , that is .
friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer . " relatives often become co-dependants , " farke said , adding that it 's a harmful response that 's often recognized too late . miriam beiseler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kids go to camp for internet addiction most people do n't realize that hours spent surfing online could be a symptom of internet addiction disorder .
now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.06.2004 france plans for its energy future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plays an important role in france 's future energy plan nuclear energy still provides france with most of its energy , but the country is looking at alternative sources for the future .
the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .

the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .

opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .

opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

unless that happens , the mandate " shall expire upon the completion of the political process , " i.e. the election of a permanent government under a new constitution by late 2005 or early 2006 . france not satisfied france , like china a permanent member of the security council with veto powers , also called for greater involvement of iraqis when deciding on future military action in the country .
" we 're not satisfied with the new resolution , " a french diplomat was quoted in news reports . unlike france and china , germany , which currently holds a rotating seat on the council but has no veto power , has not called for a specific withdrawal date .

friedbert pflüger , a foreign affairs expert for the oppositition christian democrats , welcomed the revised draft resolution .
" it 's progress that the americans and the british have set a withdrawal date for the first time , " pflüger said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio .
he added that the new resolution " by and large " took into consideration earlier justified concerns by france and germany . will iraqis have a say in military actions ? but karsten voigt , the german government 's commissioner for u.s.-german relations , said the rights of iraqis would still have to be strengthened .
it also remains unclear whether iraqis will have a say in future military actions by coalition troops , voigt added . " it 's obvious that the americans and their allies will not be able to ask the iraqis every time , " voigt told berliner zeitung .
" the question remains whether they will consult them ahead of larger operations and whether coalition troops can only act if the iraqis say ' yes ' . " the new draft resolution states that the security council welcomes iraqi efforts to develop security forces , " which will progressively play a greater role and ultimately assume responsibility for the maintenance of security and stability in iraq . " voigt also acknowledged that a complete withdrawal by coalition forces would not be possible any time soon .
" the presence of u.s. forces will be required for the time being , " he said , adding that the united states bore responsibility to bring political stability , democracy and human rights to iraq after starting the war . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de washington wants german support for iraq un resolution in an effort to win support for his u.n. iraq resolution , president george w. bush called up the german chancellor on monday , asking for his help in the security council .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .

the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

they said the new resolution still does n't address the question of complete sovereignty of the new interim iraqi government that is scheduled to take over on june 30 . china 's un ambassador , wang guangya , also said his country expected the mandate for u.s.-led coalition troops to expire when a new iraqi transitional government is elected in january 2005 . the new resolution states that the mandate would be terminated " if requested by the elected transitional government of iraq . "
unless that happens , the mandate " shall expire upon the completion of the political process , " i.e. the election of a permanent government under a new constitution by late 2005 or early 2006 . france not satisfied france , like china a permanent member of the security council with veto powers , also called for greater involvement of iraqis when deciding on future military action in the country .
" we 're not satisfied with the new resolution , " a french diplomat was quoted in news reports . unlike france and china , germany , which currently holds a rotating seat on the council but has no veto power , has not called for a specific withdrawal date .
in a telephone interview with u.s. president george w. bush on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was hopeful a compromise could be reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers have already left , but when will the others follow suit ?
friedbert pflüger , a foreign affairs expert for the oppositition christian democrats , welcomed the revised draft resolution .
" it 's progress that the americans and the british have set a withdrawal date for the first time , " pflüger said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio .
he added that the new resolution " by and large " took into consideration earlier justified concerns by france and germany . will iraqis have a say in military actions ? but karsten voigt , the german government 's commissioner for u.s.-german relations , said the rights of iraqis would still have to be strengthened .
it also remains unclear whether iraqis will have a say in future military actions by coalition troops , voigt added . " it 's obvious that the americans and their allies will not be able to ask the iraqis every time , " voigt told berliner zeitung .
" the question remains whether they will consult them ahead of larger operations and whether coalition troops can only act if the iraqis say ' yes ' . " the new draft resolution states that the security council welcomes iraqi efforts to develop security forces , " which will progressively play a greater role and ultimately assume responsibility for the maintenance of security and stability in iraq . " voigt also acknowledged that a complete withdrawal by coalition forces would not be possible any time soon .
" the presence of u.s. forces will be required for the time being , " he said , adding that the united states bore responsibility to bring political stability , democracy and human rights to iraq after starting the war . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de washington wants german support for iraq un resolution in an effort to win support for his u.n. iraq resolution , president george w. bush called up the german chancellor on monday , asking for his help in the security council .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .

" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi police close the way to al-khobar petroleum center in khobar , where six people were killed in a terrorist attack this weekend .
opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.06.2004 france plans for its energy future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plays an important role in france 's future energy plan nuclear energy still provides france with most of its energy , but the country is looking at alternative sources for the future .
the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .
-lrb- june 11 , 2002 -rrb- german nuclear industry rejects calls to close plants five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .

they said the new resolution still does n't address the question of complete sovereignty of the new interim iraqi government that is scheduled to take over on june 30 . china 's un ambassador , wang guangya , also said his country expected the mandate for u.s.-led coalition troops to expire when a new iraqi transitional government is elected in january 2005 . the new resolution states that the mandate would be terminated " if requested by the elected transitional government of iraq . "
unless that happens , the mandate " shall expire upon the completion of the political process , " i.e. the election of a permanent government under a new constitution by late 2005 or early 2006 . france not satisfied france , like china a permanent member of the security council with veto powers , also called for greater involvement of iraqis when deciding on future military action in the country .
" we 're not satisfied with the new resolution , " a french diplomat was quoted in news reports . unlike france and china , germany , which currently holds a rotating seat on the council but has no veto power , has not called for a specific withdrawal date .

it also remains unclear whether iraqis will have a say in future military actions by coalition troops , voigt added . " it 's obvious that the americans and their allies will not be able to ask the iraqis every time , " voigt told berliner zeitung .
" the question remains whether they will consult them ahead of larger operations and whether coalition troops can only act if the iraqis say ' yes ' .

" voigt also acknowledged that a complete withdrawal by coalition forces would not be possible any time soon .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

they said the new resolution still does n't address the question of complete sovereignty of the new interim iraqi government that is scheduled to take over on june 30 . china 's un ambassador , wang guangya , also said his country expected the mandate for u.s.-led coalition troops to expire when a new iraqi transitional government is elected in january 2005 . the new resolution states that the mandate would be terminated " if requested by the elected transitional government of iraq . "
unless that happens , the mandate " shall expire upon the completion of the political process , " i.e. the election of a permanent government under a new constitution by late 2005 or early 2006 . france not satisfied france , like china a permanent member of the security council with veto powers , also called for greater involvement of iraqis when deciding on future military action in the country .
" we 're not satisfied with the new resolution , " a french diplomat was quoted in news reports . unlike france and china , germany , which currently holds a rotating seat on the council but has no veto power , has not called for a specific withdrawal date .
in a telephone interview with u.s. president george w. bush on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was hopeful a compromise could be reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers have already left , but when will the others follow suit ?
friedbert pflüger , a foreign affairs expert for the oppositition christian democrats , welcomed the revised draft resolution .
" it 's progress that the americans and the british have set a withdrawal date for the first time , " pflüger said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio .
he added that the new resolution " by and large " took into consideration earlier justified concerns by france and germany . will iraqis have a say in military actions ? but karsten voigt , the german government 's commissioner for u.s.-german relations , said the rights of iraqis would still have to be strengthened .
it also remains unclear whether iraqis will have a say in future military actions by coalition troops , voigt added . " it 's obvious that the americans and their allies will not be able to ask the iraqis every time , " voigt told berliner zeitung .
" the question remains whether they will consult them ahead of larger operations and whether coalition troops can only act if the iraqis say ' yes ' . " the new draft resolution states that the security council welcomes iraqi efforts to develop security forces , " which will progressively play a greater role and ultimately assume responsibility for the maintenance of security and stability in iraq .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .
-lrb- june 11 , 2002 -rrb- german nuclear industry rejects calls to close plants five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2004 eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crude oil rose to $ 42.33 per barrel on tuesday european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .
they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "

economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2004 eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crude oil rose to $ 42.33 per barrel on tuesday european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .
they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi police close the way to al-khobar petroleum center in khobar , where six people were killed in a terrorist attack this weekend .
opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2004 germans struggle with online addiction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it should n't be man 's best friend about 30 million germans use the internet .
experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .
" you do n't realize it , " she said .
" you think that you still have a lot of friends around you . " invisible friends , that is .
friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer . " relatives often become co-dependants , " farke said , adding that it 's a harmful response that 's often recognized too late . miriam beiseler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kids go to camp for internet addiction most people do n't realize that hours spent surfing online could be a symptom of internet addiction disorder .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2004 eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crude oil rose to $ 42.33 per barrel on tuesday european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .
they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi police close the way to al-khobar petroleum center in khobar , where six people were killed in a terrorist attack this weekend .
opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .

it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .

they said the new resolution still does n't address the question of complete sovereignty of the new interim iraqi government that is scheduled to take over on june 30 . china 's un ambassador , wang guangya , also said his country expected the mandate for u.s.-led coalition troops to expire when a new iraqi transitional government is elected in january 2005 . the new resolution states that the mandate would be terminated " if requested by the elected transitional government of iraq . "
unless that happens , the mandate " shall expire upon the completion of the political process , " i.e. the election of a permanent government under a new constitution by late 2005 or early 2006 . france not satisfied france , like china a permanent member of the security council with veto powers , also called for greater involvement of iraqis when deciding on future military action in the country .
" we 're not satisfied with the new resolution , " a french diplomat was quoted in news reports . unlike france and china , germany , which currently holds a rotating seat on the council but has no veto power , has not called for a specific withdrawal date .

he added that the new resolution " by and large " took into consideration earlier justified concerns by france and germany . will iraqis have a say in military actions ? but karsten voigt , the german government 's commissioner for u.s.-german relations , said the rights of iraqis would still have to be strengthened .
it also remains unclear whether iraqis will have a say in future military actions by coalition troops , voigt added . " it 's obvious that the americans and their allies will not be able to ask the iraqis every time , " voigt told berliner zeitung .
" the question remains whether they will consult them ahead of larger operations and whether coalition troops can only act if the iraqis say ' yes ' . " the new draft resolution states that the security council welcomes iraqi efforts to develop security forces , " which will progressively play a greater role and ultimately assume responsibility for the maintenance of security and stability in iraq . " voigt also acknowledged that a complete withdrawal by coalition forces would not be possible any time soon .
" the presence of u.s. forces will be required for the time being , " he said , adding that the united states bore responsibility to bring political stability , democracy and human rights to iraq after starting the war . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de washington wants german support for iraq un resolution in an effort to win support for his u.n. iraq resolution , president george w. bush called up the german chancellor on monday , asking for his help in the security council .

france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .
-lrb- june 11 , 2002 -rrb- german nuclear industry rejects calls to close plants five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment .

" voigt also acknowledged that a complete withdrawal by coalition forces would not be possible any time soon .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi police close the way to al-khobar petroleum center in khobar , where six people were killed in a terrorist attack this weekend .
opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi police close the way to al-khobar petroleum center in khobar , where six people were killed in a terrorist attack this weekend .
opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .

just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .

prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .
" you do n't realize it , " she said .
" you think that you still have a lot of friends around you . " invisible friends , that is .
friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer . " relatives often become co-dependants , " farke said , adding that it 's a harmful response that 's often recognized too late . miriam beiseler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kids go to camp for internet addiction most people do n't realize that hours spent surfing online could be a symptom of internet addiction disorder .

since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .
-lrb- june 11 , 2002 -rrb- german nuclear industry rejects calls to close plants five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2004 germans struggle with online addiction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it should n't be man 's best friend about 30 million germans use the internet .
experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .
" you do n't realize it , " she said .
" you think that you still have a lot of friends around you . " invisible friends , that is .
friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer . " relatives often become co-dependants , " farke said , adding that it 's a harmful response that 's often recognized too late . miriam beiseler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kids go to camp for internet addiction most people do n't realize that hours spent surfing online could be a symptom of internet addiction disorder .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .

it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .

friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .
" you do n't realize it , " she said .
" you think that you still have a lot of friends around you . " invisible friends , that is .
friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi police close the way to al-khobar petroleum center in khobar , where six people were killed in a terrorist attack this weekend .
opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2004 eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crude oil rose to $ 42.33 per barrel on tuesday european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .
they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi police close the way to al-khobar petroleum center in khobar , where six people were killed in a terrorist attack this weekend .
opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

they called on opec to act to calm the market . responding to the recent international surge in oil prices that have made filling the tank a lot more dear for europeans , finance ministers from the european union on tuesday called onthe organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- to take action to cool off the market .
following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .

following the regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in luxembourg , french economics and finance minister nicolas sarkozy said the ministers were unified in their desire for a common strategy to halt soaring oil prices .
the meeting also set the stage for a larger meeting planned with all 25 eu finance ministers to discuss the undesired price hikes , which have accompanied the war in iraq and have been compounded by this week 's terrorist attacks on petroleum companies in saudi arabia .
germany 's eichel expresses concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european central bank president jean-claude trichet , left , walks past germany 's finance minister hans eichel , center , and luxembourg counterpart jean-claude juncker at the start of the eurogroup council in luxembourg .
german finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo , center -rrb- said he was concerned that rising oil costs could have consequences for the economy , and warned that any initiative in response to the danger should be coordinated at the eu level .
despite skitishness about the economy , most of the ministers also expressed optimism .
sarkozy noted that even the european central bank had weighed in optimistically about the effects of higher oil prices on growth and inflation .
as the european commission recently concluded , the ecb said the price hikes would likely have only a moderate impact on growth and rises in prices .
" we have to be a little bit worried about the impact -lrb- of high oil prices -rrb- on the economy , " eichel said .
patting off criticism from the past , eu officials have said they will react in a coordinated manner to oil developments .
just four years ago , in the face of rising oil prices , many european capitals bucked an eu agreement and called for tax cuts and other measures to ease the pain for consumers .
truckers across the continent went on strike , disrupting deliveries , and countries like france , italy and the netherlands began giving rebates to commercial operators .
france 's sarkozy said the " situation in 2000 should not be repeated , " according to the associated press .
the european commission has warned that if the euro exchange rates hold steady , lasting high oil prices could dampen expected economic growth in the euro zone this year by 0.2 percent , reducing the total to 1.5 percent .
german economic experts warn against hysteria but not all shared that view .
the chairman of germany 's influential council of economic advisors , an independent body of five economists that advises the government , disputed the commission 's conclusion and warned against hysteria .
though high oil prices do represent a " certain risk " for the economy , wolfgang wiegard told the berliner zeitung newspaper , proven calculations suggest that continuing high prices would likely only reduce economic growth by a quarter percentage point per year .
" that 's why we should n't just fall into hysteria , " he told the paper .
not too long ago , wiegard noted , the strength of the euro was seen as a threat to the economy .
but the new paper tiger is oil prices .
" in my opinion , it would be wrong to react with hectic measures like sinking the eco tax , " he said .
" rising prices signalize an increasing scarcity of oil that ca n't be remedied through a reduction in the eco tax . "
opec could lower prices german finance minister eichel said he was optimistic that opec would reach a decision to reduce oil prices at its meeting this thursday .
" of course , that could be difficult if we must expect further terrorist attacks , " eichel said .
" but otherwise , i think , opec will be a partner that is concerned about keeping the world economy on track . "
on wednesday , the president of opec said the states must increase their oil production despite current near capacity levels in order to alleviate the crisis .
" what we need is a volume that can give a really significant impact to oil prices , " opec president purnomo yusgiantoro of indonesia said .

opec has been struggling to control oil prices amidst concern about the reliability of oil supplies in the wake of war and terrorist attacks in saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil producer .
on tuesday , the first day of trading on world markets after the attacks in khobar , saudi arabia , light crude prices in the u.s. jumped by $ 2.45 to $ 42.33 per barrel , the highest price in 21 years of oil futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in car-loving germany , oil prices stir passionate debate with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .

it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .

friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer .

experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .
" you do n't realize it , " she said .
" you think that you still have a lot of friends around you . " invisible friends , that is .
friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer . " relatives often become co-dependants , " farke said , adding that it 's a harmful response that 's often recognized too late . miriam beiseler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kids go to camp for internet addiction most people do n't realize that hours spent surfing online could be a symptom of internet addiction disorder .
now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .
however , environmentally sound energy policy is not only limited to the public sphere , according to sarkozy .
part of the energy plan will focus on ways to get the french in the habit of saving on electricity use . daniela junghans -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu proposes tighter rules for nuclear safety the european commission has proposed a set of new rules which will give the eu unprecedented powers in monioring the safety of nuclear reactors across europe .
-lrb- june 11 , 2002 -rrb- german nuclear industry rejects calls to close plants five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .

the national assembly votes this week on a new energy law . the planned law seeks to tackle the stubborn problem of developing stable and dependable energy sources for the future that are also environmentally sound .
france fears , as do many other european countries , that it will become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels that must be imported for its energy production . to avoid over dependency on foreign energy sources , the french government is investing more in its nuclear power program .
the country 's existing nuclear power plants are to be renovated and expanded in line with the wishes of france 's economics minister , nicolas sarkozy .
according to him , nuclear energy makes sense from an environmental protection standpoint . " getting out of nuclear energy would raise our co2 emissions by 30 percent , " said sarkozy , speaking in front of parliamentarians . part of the government 's nuclear strategy is the development of a new power plant technology , a so-called ep reactor , which uses pressurized water and is supposed to be much safer and even less expensive to run than current nuclear plants .
the development project , which the french government wants to test in the near future , is a cooperative effort among several european energy concerns including the state-owned eléctricité de france , edf . france is feeling some pressure to adopt the new technology soon : many of its nuclear plants in operation are beginning to show their years .
in 2011 , one half of all its nuclear facilities will have reached the their age limit of 30 years .
since some 77 percent of france 's energy needs are met through nuclear power , planning for the future of the country 's nuclear plants is a top priority . renewables not forgotten although nuclear power often gets the lion 's share of attention , renewable energy is also getting its time in the spotlight and has been designated the second pillar of france 's energy plan .
the government wants to bring in technologies such as biomass , wind and water energy to stir up the country 's energy mix without doing damage to the environment .
by 2010 , one-fifth of france 's energy is supposed to come from alternative sources , in line with eu guidelines that apply to all of its member states . france is primarily focusing on water and wind energy , since both energy-generating methods have been long in use and are uncontroversial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2004 germans struggle with online addiction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it should n't be man 's best friend about 30 million germans use the internet .
experts believe up to one million people are addicted to surfing online .
reasons vary , but addicts have one thing in common : they 're virtually trying to escape the real world . neglecting real relationships and daily tasks to spend more time in front of the computer are clear signs for a budding online addiction , according to experts .
but it 's still difficult to say at what point internet use becomes obsessive .
" it 's not clearly defined yet , " said rainer gölz , who heads mediarisk international , a german organization that offers help to online addicts and the people around them . gölz recounted the story of a 19-year-old woman as an example : she completely shut herself off from her circle of friends and spent the whole day online .
her mother finally contacted mediarisk for help .
" it 's an addiction that takes over quickly , " gölz said , adding that he sees it as an " escape from the real world . " hiding behind a screen name judging from e-mails received by gölz 's organization , people become addicted for different reasons .
many say that the possibility of hiding behind a screen name and the irrelevance of personal appearance have allowed them to completely immerse themselves in the virtual world . forms of addiction vary as well : some spend hours downloading pornographic images from the web , others play games for several days without interruption .
a third group obsessively bids on items at internet auctions , regardless of whether they actually need the products or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online addiction is common among single people .
while a team of scientists at berlin 's humboldt university has done extensive research on the topic , online addiction is still not recognized as an illness , gölz said .
the university study , headed by psychologist matthias jerusalem , was based on interviews with 10,000 internet users .
it revealed that men under 20 and singles are especially prone to online addiction . some experts are recovering addicts themselves .
gabriele farke doesn ’ t like to talk about her own history of excessive online surfing but knows what she 's talking about when she advises people who come to her for help .
" the allure of constantly staying online is completely subconscious , " farke said .
" they live in a dream world and feel like they can talk about their problems and desires all the time . " invisible friends farke says that reality looks a lot different : people stop making time for their friends , hobbies or even daily chores .
" you do n't realize it , " she said .
" you think that you still have a lot of friends around you . " invisible friends , that is .
friends you ca n't see .
friends you can only communicate with via the keyboard . realizing one 's own addiction takes drastic things to happen , farke said , adding that the loss of a partner can force people to start thinking about their problem .
once online addicts come to her for help , she sets up a plan of action with them to return to a healthier level of internet use .
addicts slowly reduce the amount of time they spend in front of the computer and some even begin therapy to deal with the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : support from friends and relatives is crucial , farke said : " it often helps when people talk about the use of the internet : what are you looking for ?
why do n't you talk to me about your problems ? "
relatives should also make sure that addicts are included in family life .
they should be encouraged to eat their dinner at the table instead of staying in front of the computer . " relatives often become co-dependants , " farke said , adding that it 's a harmful response that 's often recognized too late . miriam beiseler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kids go to camp for internet addiction most people do n't realize that hours spent surfing online could be a symptom of internet addiction disorder .
now german parents whose children show signs of the affliction can send them to a unique camp to get help .

with a barrel of oil now totaling more than $ 40 , german opposition politicians say enough is enough and call on chancellor gerhard schröder to take action to curb the trajectory of skyrocketing oil prices . in the land of bmws , mercedes and unlimited speeds on many highways , a look at the prices at the pump these days gives german motorists a bad case of sticker shock .
prices for gasoline have soared in recent weeks to more than € 1.20 , or almost $ 1.50 , per liter .
lawmakers from the opposition conservatives and neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have now called on german chancellor gerhard schröder to act jointly with the oil industry to bring down gas and fuel prices .
rainer brüderle , economic affairs spokesman for the fdp fears that this year 's nascent economic upswing in germany could be impaired if schröder doesn ’ t move swiftly .
a severe risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car-loving chancellor : gerhard schröder behind the wheel of a porsche carrera gt .
" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

" the situation right now , " he said , " is that modest economic growth in germany is being severely put at risk by rising gas prices .
the chancellor likes to present himself as a motoring enthusiast and a potent broker in all sorts of things .
so he should quickly act now and get german gasoline producers , the cartel office and politicians to sit down and discuss how prices can be reduced . "
the debate over the cost of oil comes at a time when the german economy is slowly climbing out of three years of stagnation and is expected to grow by a meager 1.5 percent this and next year .
economic growth is also being hampered by widespread domestic uncertainty about jobs and incomes , causing germans to save more and spend less .
in addition , experts believe an oil price above $ 40 per barrel could fuel inflation in europe and prompt the european central bank to raise interest rates .
this would mean an almost certain end to economic growth in germany .
and that 's causing german opposition politicians , like the fdp 's brüderle , to demand government action to lower a number of taxes that help jack up fuel prices here .
" we can not influence the market price for oil , " brüderle said , " but we can do something about taxes .
more than 70 percent of the overall gas price is determined by government taxes and levies , including the controversial ecology tax on fuels and energy .
we are demanding that the eco tax be lifted for a certain period of time , so that fuel prices can come down to a tolerable level .
we have to stabilize the economy and the chancellor should be focusing his efforts in this direction . "
schröder , however , is unlikely to heed the opposition 's call , as a huge chunk of the revenues from the eco tax are being used to stabilize the german statutory pensions system in an effort to keep non-wage labor costs in check .
meanwhile , the social democrats ' junior coalition partner in government , the green party , is clamoring for higher fuel prices , not lower ones .
the party believes this will eventually force the auto industry to produce more fuel-efficient cars as well as force consumers to embrace the energy-saving technologies of the future . uwe hessler -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers urge opec to halt soaring oil prices european union finance ministers meeting in luxembourg late tuesday expressed concern that surging oil prices could stifle europe 's fledgling economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.06.2004 criticism continues despite new resolution on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has some convincing to do a revised draft for a un resolution on iraq 's future proposed by the u.s. and britain would set a departure date for foreign troops , but some security council members said more changes are still needed . representatives from germany , france and russia expressed continuing concern about the proposal during a closed meeting late tuesday , according to diplomats .
they said the new resolution still does n't address the question of complete sovereignty of the new interim iraqi government that is scheduled to take over on june 30 . china 's un ambassador , wang guangya , also said his country expected the mandate for u.s.-led coalition troops to expire when a new iraqi transitional government is elected in january 2005 . the new resolution states that the mandate would be terminated " if requested by the elected transitional government of iraq . "
unless that happens , the mandate " shall expire upon the completion of the political process , " i.e. the election of a permanent government under a new constitution by late 2005 or early 2006 . france not satisfied france , like china a permanent member of the security council with veto powers , also called for greater involvement of iraqis when deciding on future military action in the country .
" we 're not satisfied with the new resolution , " a french diplomat was quoted in news reports . unlike france and china , germany , which currently holds a rotating seat on the council but has no veto power , has not called for a specific withdrawal date .
in a telephone interview with u.s. president george w. bush on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was hopeful a compromise could be reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers have already left , but when will the others follow suit ?
friedbert pflüger , a foreign affairs expert for the oppositition christian democrats , welcomed the revised draft resolution .
" it 's progress that the americans and the british have set a withdrawal date for the first time , " pflüger said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio .
he added that the new resolution " by and large " took into consideration earlier justified concerns by france and germany . will iraqis have a say in military actions ? but karsten voigt , the german government 's commissioner for u.s.-german relations , said the rights of iraqis would still have to be strengthened .
it also remains unclear whether iraqis will have a say in future military actions by coalition troops , voigt added . " it 's obvious that the americans and their allies will not be able to ask the iraqis every time , " voigt told berliner zeitung .
" the question remains whether they will consult them ahead of larger operations and whether coalition troops can only act if the iraqis say ' yes ' .

researchers have been carrying out tests on a potential new drug that targets cancer tumours without harming healthy tissue .
however , they have struggled to deliver the drug directly to tumours because the immune system attacks it before it can get to work .
now researchers at cancer research uk believe they may have found a way around the problem .
' smuggled in ' they have managed to disguise key elements of the drug and smuggle it into the body undetected .
the drug , called monoclonal antibodies , is delivered into the body using a technique called antibody directed enzyme pro-drug therapy or adept .
this study has identified a relatively simple method of reducing the body 's reaction against this enzyme professor robert souhami , cancer research uk this technique involves injecting patients with an enzyme or protein that attaches itself to cancer cells .
patients are then injected with monoclonal antibodies .
these drugs are only activated when they encounter the protein .
they lock onto the protein and cause the body 's own immune system to start attacking the cancer cells too .
they can also cause the cancer cells to destroy themselves .
trials of these drugs have so far had limited success because the immune system sees it as a threat .
the scientists hope their discovery will boost efforts to develop these drugs as a possible new treatment .
" minimising the immune response ... will increase the potential of many forms of adept for clinical use , " said lead researcher dr astrid mayer , who is based at the royal free and university college medical school .
professor robert souhami of cancer research uk welcomed the findings .
" this study has identified a relatively simple method of reducing the body 's reaction against this enzyme , " he said .
" finding ways of disguising the molecular features of certain cancer therapies could make them safer and more effective . "
the study is published in the british journal of cancer .

sinn fein assembly member for upper bann , john o 'dowd , wrote to angela smith at the end of march , calling for a ban on smoke in the workplace .
in her response , the minister said the onus was not on the government , but on employers to tackle this issue through health and safety legislation .
in her letter , she said : " existing health and safety legislation may afford protection from exposure to tobacco , although this has not been tested in the criminal courts .
" while there is no specific statutory duty on employers to ban smoking , the legislation does place a duty on employers to ensure the health , safety and welfare of their employees and of others who may be affected . "

a report on the workplace ban , by the office of tobacco control -lrb- otc -rrb- , found one in five smokers now choose not to smoke at all on a night out .
since the ban was imposed on 29 march , 96 % of pubs and restaurants have complied - with 89 % displaying the required no smoking signs .

officially , the ban aims to achieve a smoke-free environment in pubs and restaurants to protect the health of those who work there , but in practice , it is also expected to cut smoking in the country .

it will be based in st austell but will offer a home to families from north cornwall , caradon and restormel district council areas .
figures show 25 % of all violent crimes in the south west are related to domestic violence .
at the moment , cornwall only has two refuges - one in penzance and another in truro .
now the devon and cornwall housing association is opening a new refuge at st austell in august .

around 21 families have been living on land in wolvey road , bulkington , for three years .
nuneaton and bedworth borough council offered to re-house the families in council accommodation after winning an eviction order at the high court .
but the travellers say they do not want to live in bricks and mortar .
legal wrangling although the travellers own the site in bulkington , they were served with an eviction order because they put up fences and driveways on the green belt land without planning permission .
the council postponed an eviction in january after the group dug trenches , formed a human shield and set fire to caravans to prevent bailiffs from evicting them .
but after two years of legal wrangling , which cost the local authority just under £ 100,000 , the high court ruled last month that the council 's eviction order was lawful .
the authority pledged to do all it could to find alternatives for the travellers and offered to re-house them in council accommodation .
but so far the travellers say bricks and mortar do not fit in with their way of life .

a report by the cpre says that green belt land will be destroyed if the current redevelopment plans go ahead .
it also claims that london 's housing shortage problems can be solved by building only on brownfield sites .
the cpre report says it backs the creation of new homes but is concerned about the loss of " fragile habitats " .
the thames gateway is a 40-mile-wide area from east and south-east london to kent and essex .
the london part of the site is already earmarked for 60,000 new homes .
flood fears but mayor of london ken livingstone says it could take at least 91,000 to meet london 's long-term housing needs .
a blueprint shows 55 primary schools , six police stations and 19 health centres are needed for the new population .
mr livingstone said : " nowhere else in the city offers a comparable opportunity to deliver new homes at the same time as delivering major improvements for existing residents . "
but some environmental campaigners are worried about the fate of the green belt , poorer air quality and worse traffic .

mr chalabi broke the news to an iranian intelligence chief in baghdad , the new york times says , quoting us officials .
the officials said the leak was one of washington 's reasons for breaking with mr chalabi , the paper reported .
mr chalabi was once seen by the white house as a possible iraqi leader , but the relationship has soured badly .
last year , mr chalabi was one of the first iraqi exiles to be flown back into iraq following the us-led invasion .
however , he became increasingly distanced from washington over allegations that he was linked to iranian hardliners .
the us has also questioned the quality of intelligence provided by his party , the iraqi national congress , in the run-up to the invasion .
the pentagon had been paying mr chalabi 's party $ 335,000 a month as part of an intelligence-gathering programme , but cut off funding last month .
a few days later , american and iraqi forces raided his home and offices , seizing documents and computers .
' drunken ' revelation the new york times now says that mr chalabi is accused of telling the iranians that the us had broken the secret communications code of tehran 's intelligence service .
the information was discovered , says the paper , when the us intercepted a note from an iranian agent in baghdad detailing his conversation with mr chalabi .
the agent told his masters in tehran that mr chalabi claimed to have obtained the information from a drunken american who gave the game away , the paper said .
it has not been revealed how the us broke the code in the first place .
the new york times says it has known of the allegation for some time , but was asked by the bush administration to withhold publication , in order to avoid compromising a vital intelligence operation .
that request was withdrawn on tuesday and the fbi is now investigating the matter , says the paper .
mr chalabi has strenuously denied passing any classified information to iran .

"
this claim made by ladbrokes chief executive , chris bell to the bbc money programme , has sent shockwaves across the horse racing industry .
the assertion is the latest bout in a long battle between the traditional bookmakers such as ladbrokes and william hill , and betting exchanges such as betfair .
betfair began in 2000 and is an internet site which matches two individuals with differing opinions on the outcome of any sporting event .
when you bet on a horse to win with betfair , you are not betting against betfair , as you would be if you made a bet with ladbrokes or william hill , you are betting against another punter who thinks the horse will lose .
both sides of the bet are put in a separate account run by betfair and when the race is finished , which ever side wins the bet , will win the money .
the claims made by chris bell underline the main criticism of the traditional bookmakers , against betfair .
open door ladbrokes and william hill say that the option of betting on a horse to lose with betfair is opening the door to somebody benefiting if they know a horse wo n't win .
it 's a full audit trail .
it 's an unprecedented audit trail mark davies betfair boss david harding chief executive of william hill expresses his concerns to the money programme : " because the opportunity 's there , because it 's possible to stop horses inevitably people will seek to profit from it . "
but betfair assert that far from corrupting racing , they are helping to prevent cheating by monitoring every account they have .
" we know who you bet with , we know where your money came from , we know where your money is being withdrawn to .
all that information is there , it 's a full audit trail , it 's an unprecedented audit trail , " mark davies , managing director of betfair told the money programme .
in june 2003 , betfair signed an agreement with the jockey club , the racing regulator , to alert them to any suspicious betting patterns on the site and to make their records available to the jockey club for investigations .
the jockey club confirmed to the money programme that the agreement has been extremely important in at least one case investigating allegations of cheating .
happy punters throughout the battle , betfair has continued to emphasise its marketing message of better odds for the punter , more choice and better value .
the money programme tested betfair 's claim of better odds against the traditional bookmakers .
if a punter were to bet £ 2 on each of the winners in an afternoon 's racing at goodwood on may 18th , on both betfair and with the traditional bookmakers , he would have won £ 187 with the traditional bookmakers , but £ 334 with betfair .
and all the signs are that the punters are happy with the service .
betfair 's customer base has grown from 75,000 in 2002 to 200,000 today , with an annual turnover of £ 2bn .
profits squeeze but the traditional bookmakers are fighting back with another argument .
the advent of the exchanges has meant that the bookmakers ca n't control the prices as they could in the past keith elliot horserace betting levy board they claim that when betfair punters bet a horse will lose , like traditional bookmakers , they 're taking bets from people who think it will win .
so the bookies say , these punters are effectively bookmakers and should be licensed .
the government will announce later this month whether it plans to target individual betfair punters who bet on horses to lose - this would open the door to the option of their being taxed .
this development would have far reaching implications for the running of the betfair business .
but behind the pr war , splashed across the headlines of every newspaper in the country , experts argue that it is not the concerns over corruption , but rather the squeeze on the traditional bookmakers ' margins which is the real reason for the battle .
virtual options keith elliot , director of the horserace betting levy board said : " in essence the advent of the exchanges has meant that the bookmakers ca n't control the prices as they could in the past and that has reduced their profits on horse racing and that has affected every one of their betting shops in the country . "

"
this claim made by ladbrokes chief executive , chris bell to the bbc money programme , has sent shockwaves across the horse racing industry .
the assertion is the latest bout in a long battle between the traditional bookmakers such as ladbrokes and william hill , and betting exchanges such as betfair .
betfair began in 2000 and is an internet site which matches two individuals with differing opinions on the outcome of any sporting event .
when you bet on a horse to win with betfair , you are not betting against betfair , as you would be if you made a bet with ladbrokes or william hill , you are betting against another punter who thinks the horse will lose .
both sides of the bet are put in a separate account run by betfair and when the race is finished , which ever side wins the bet , will win the money .
the claims made by chris bell underline the main criticism of the traditional bookmakers , against betfair .
open door ladbrokes and william hill say that the option of betting on a horse to lose with betfair is opening the door to somebody benefiting if they know a horse wo n't win .
it 's a full audit trail .
it 's an unprecedented audit trail mark davies betfair boss david harding chief executive of william hill expresses his concerns to the money programme : " because the opportunity 's there , because it 's possible to stop horses inevitably people will seek to profit from it . "
but betfair assert that far from corrupting racing , they are helping to prevent cheating by monitoring every account they have .
" we know who you bet with , we know where your money came from , we know where your money is being withdrawn to .
all that information is there , it 's a full audit trail , it 's an unprecedented audit trail , " mark davies , managing director of betfair told the money programme .
in june 2003 , betfair signed an agreement with the jockey club , the racing regulator , to alert them to any suspicious betting patterns on the site and to make their records available to the jockey club for investigations .
the jockey club confirmed to the money programme that the agreement has been extremely important in at least one case investigating allegations of cheating .
happy punters throughout the battle , betfair has continued to emphasise its marketing message of better odds for the punter , more choice and better value .
the money programme tested betfair 's claim of better odds against the traditional bookmakers .
if a punter were to bet £ 2 on each of the winners in an afternoon 's racing at goodwood on may 18th , on both betfair and with the traditional bookmakers , he would have won £ 187 with the traditional bookmakers , but £ 334 with betfair .
and all the signs are that the punters are happy with the service .
betfair 's customer base has grown from 75,000 in 2002 to 200,000 today , with an annual turnover of £ 2bn .
profits squeeze but the traditional bookmakers are fighting back with another argument .
the advent of the exchanges has meant that the bookmakers ca n't control the prices as they could in the past keith elliot horserace betting levy board they claim that when betfair punters bet a horse will lose , like traditional bookmakers , they 're taking bets from people who think it will win .
so the bookies say , these punters are effectively bookmakers and should be licensed .
the government will announce later this month whether it plans to target individual betfair punters who bet on horses to lose - this would open the door to the option of their being taxed .
this development would have far reaching implications for the running of the betfair business .
but behind the pr war , splashed across the headlines of every newspaper in the country , experts argue that it is not the concerns over corruption , but rather the squeeze on the traditional bookmakers ' margins which is the real reason for the battle .
virtual options keith elliot , director of the horserace betting levy board said : " in essence the advent of the exchanges has meant that the bookmakers ca n't control the prices as they could in the past and that has reduced their profits on horse racing and that has affected every one of their betting shops in the country . "

the government has signed a deal with netcare to carry out 41,600 cataract operations over the next five years .
the operations are being done in mobile clinics , which will travel around england .
scheme rejected the board of south west oxfordshire primary care trust voted against proposals to sign up to the scheme last november only to change its mind at a meeting in december .
we refute any claims of coercion spokeswoman , department of health the original rejection followed concerns from doctors that any deal would have a serious effect on local nhs services .
hospital consultants had warned that it would starve local hospitals of cash and affect their ability to carry out more difficult operations and to train doctors .
in december , sir nigel crisp , nhs chief executive , told the bbc that primary care trusts would be given the power to decide for themselves what services they need .
but professor martin avis , the former chairman of south west oxfordshire pct , says the trust was ordered to overturn its decision .
" my chief executive was told that the minister required a reversal of the decision on his desk early the following week , " he said .
asked which minister was involved , he replied health secretary john reid .
under pressure professor avis complained to the chairman of the local strategic health authority .
however , it was under pressure from above to ensure pcts signed up to the scheme .
" we were under tremendous pressure to get a ' yes ' vote , " jane bett , its chairman told file on 4 .
she said the health authority was caught in a " tug of war between pcts and the department of health . "
professor avis was recently asked to re-apply for his job as chairman of the pct .
he decided against doing so .
jane hanna , another member of the trust resigned last week .
she backed up claims of government interference .
" there is no room for local autonomy , " she said .
" i am not really willing to be a rubber stamp for government .
the public is sold the message that they are the key to decision making in the nhs today and that is simply not the case . "
sir nigel crisp was questioned about the case in an interview with file on 4 .
however , he walked out of the interview before it had been completed .
liberal democrat mp evan harris , who represents oxford west , accused the government of bullying nhs officials into working with private firms .
" i do n't think the government should claim its a local decision and then bully behind the scenes , " he said .
a spokeswoman for the department of health said : " the department of health makes no apologies for encouraging the nhs to take up innovative and successful schemes .
" thousands of patients have had their cataract operations more quickly , free at the point of need , as a result of this deal " .
she added : " it is for the local nhs to decide how best to meet the health needs of its local people , and we refute any claims of coercion . "

bradley murdoch , 45 , denies shooting peter falconio , 28 , and abducting and assaulting his girlfriend , joanne lees .
his business associate james hepi said he had discussed ways of getting rid of a body , including putting it inside a drain on the side of the road .
the six-week committal hearing will decide if mr murdoch will face a trial .
mr hepi told darwin magistrates court that , around the time of mr falconio 's disappearance , he had seen mr murdoch making handcuffs out of wire cables " very similar " to a replica of those ms lees had said were used to tie her hands behind her back .
mr murdoch had been on one of his regular trips across the central australian outback at the time of mr falconio 's disappearance on a lonely stretch of the stuart highway north of alice springs three years ago , mr hepi added .
the appearance of the vehicle changed dramatically james hepi mr murdoch had often used the stuart highway - but after arriving in the coastal town of broome two days after mr falconio 's disappearance , he had shaved off his moustache , shaved his head , and immediately put his truck in for repairs .
" the appearance of the vehicle changed dramatically , " he said .
" it was heavily modified , " mr hepi added .
he also told the court mr murdoch had had two hand guns - a big , heavy revolver and a smaller one , which he wore in a holster beneath his clothes or kept in his car .
ms lees has said a truck driver pointed a silver western-style , long-barrel revolver at them after flagging down mr falconio 's van and saying sparks were coming from its exhaust .
during the proceedings , mr murdoch stared intently at mr hepi , and shook his head .

the proposals , aimed at restoring public confidence in the sector , will go out to consultation before they are formally examined by msps .
the voluntary sector has welcomed the charities and trustee investment bill .
margaret curran said it would , for the first time , provide a definition of a charity based on the principle of public benefit .
last year the scottish executive admitted that confidence in scotland 's charity laws had been undermined following two high-profile cases .
breast cancer research -lrb- scotland -rrb- had its assets frozen after an investigation found that only £ 1.5m of the £ 13m it raised had actually been donated to charity . "
we 'd like to see a definition of public benefit in the bill and i think that would help guide the regulator in their decisions " martin sime scvo later in the year the court of session moved to have directors of the moonbeams children 's cancer charity permanently removed after they failed to answer allegations that just £ 70,000 of almost £ 3m raised went to sufferers and their families .
under the new proposals , each charity will have to submit its accounts for scrutiny and more information about how they spend the money they raise will be made available .
there will also be increased powers of investigation for the office of the scottish charity regulator -lrb- oscr -rrb- .
' robust regime ' ms curran told bbc radio scotland : " at present it does n't make it clear that organisations who want to be charities must show public benefit .
" i think overall this package will introduce the robust regime that i think people are expecting of charities in scotland but also ensure that we have flexibility and that it is a proportionate regime .
" the majority of charities do not deserve to have their reputations tarnished because of the dishonest activities of a few individuals .
" this draft bill will repeal existing charity law and create one single , modern framework for charity regulation in scotland .
improving accountability martin sime , chief executive of the scottish council for voluntary organisations -lrb- scvo -rrb- said there were many proposals in the new bill which would make life simpler for charities and improve accountability .
but he said a clear definition of public benefit was needed .
he said : " we want msps to lead a debate here and we 're hoping that legislation will make it clear what our government wants in this area .
" we 'd like to see a definition of public benefit in the bill and i think that would help guide the regulator in their decisions .
" the key point is , a charity ought to mean what it says on the tin .
the public understanding of what a charity is should accord with the legal understanding of who can become a charity . "
the scottish national party has called on the scottish executive to state a date on which the bill will be introduced into the parliament .
