after dismal performances in recent years at the eurovision song contest , germany 's steering clear of its kitsch pop crooners this year and instead teaming up with music channel viva to find a cooler act . eurovision , the popular annual europe-wide music event , has become something of a national embarrassment for germany in recent years .
not only has the country come away empty handed from the competition for the past 22 years , but the quality of its kitschy pop-singing candidates too has been in steady decline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou hoffner last year marked an all-time low with shock-haired , botox-injected lou hoffner -lrb- photo -rrb- coming in an agonizing 13th at the finals in latvia with her clap-your-hands ditty " let 's get happy " penned by none other than german veteran producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german eurovision candidates since 1976 - with only one lucky hit -rrb- . thumbs down for " schlagermusik " but things will be different , and many hope better , this year . as the contest to shortlist a german entry for this year 's eurovision in istanbul looms , the country 's competition organizers have decided to depart from decades of german " schlagermusik , " the sentimental , hand-swaying music often produced by siegel and often performed one-time eurovision crooner michelle , and bring in some new blood instead . in a first , public broadcaster ard has joined forces with the music television channel viva to search for slick young acts to fight it out at the preliminaries , which will be broadcast live on friday . eurovision organizer jürgen meier-beer has stressed that the german eurovision bid needed an image makeover . " we have to win back young spectators who we lost in the last preliminary contest .
after all , it 's the younger generation that determines international music trends , " he said . embracing a market-friendly policy the tie-up with viva has also changed the way germany sends candidates to its eurovision selection round . where once closed-door juries in the all-powerful music industry sent their favorites to the preliminaries , now it 's young music fans themselves who decide through their cd purchases which groups get to the selection . the idea is that record labels send videos of their artists to viva .
the channel then broadcasts the clips on a special weekly tv program called " euroclash , " giving the artists exposure . those who make it highest on the german charts go to the preliminaries . the new market-friendly concept has already ensured that " schlagermusik " fare is out of the running .
instead the finalist group features prominent artists and runs the gamut from techno , house , soul and electro pop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german rapper sabrina setlur techno group scooter , berlin-based electropunk band mia , mannheim-born half-iraqi pop singer laith al-deen , rapper sabrina setlur -lrb- photo -rrb- , house and techno dj westbam and afrika islam with his trademark techno à la hip hop style are among the 12 acts that will fight it out for a chance to represent germany in istanbul in may . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wins eurovision song contest turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu .

german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a new internet platform for music by downloading the first song on thursday .
the german music industry hopes " phonoline " can help reverse its sagging fortunes . internet file swapping sites like kazaa and gnutella have become the archfiends of the music industry , blamed for the plummeting sales of pre-recorded cds and said to be driving a global business sector close to collapse .
now the industry in germany is fighting back , or at least offering an alternative to people who want to get their music digitally .
downloading kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german chancellor launched " phonoline " at the cebit computer trade fair in hanover .
phonoline is the german answer to itunes , the successful american pay-per-download site run by apple computer . it offers browsers 250,000 songs from a spectrum of different genres for download .
its operators say they hope to expand the catalog eventually to some 700,000 songs and say all the big industry labels , from universal music to bmg to sony , warner and emi , will have their artists represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britney spears madonna and christina aguilera the cost of a song ranges between € 1.19 to € 1.99 -lrb- $ 1.49 to $ 2.50 -rrb- , more expensive than the itunes price , 99 cents a song .
" the -lsb- phonoline -rsb- download is still more attractive than buying a whole cd , " klaus-peter schulenberg , head of cts eventim , one of phonoline 's partners , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
if the computer user wants the whole cd , he said the service will offer song package deals running between € 9.99 and € 16.99 -lrb- $ 12.50 and $ 21.25 -rrb- .
repeated delays phonoline was presented with great fanfare at last year 's popkomm music trade fair in cologne .
it was touted as a way to bring downloading lawbreakers back into the fold of legality and clip the wings of sites like kazaa .
then , there was much talk of phonoline being the first german site to offer a comprehensive platform including the music from both major and independent labels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popkomm the launch date was initially set for shortly after popkomm closed it doors last summer .
but months passed and the service remained offline .
a new date set for fall also came and went , since it had n't been decided who would be responsible for the technical side of the site .
phonoline missed the crucial christmas season as more details were ironed out .
" now there wo n't be any more delays , " said schulenberg . he hopes , despite the late start , to sell some five million songs online this year .
he admits it 's an ambitious goal .
an industry in trouble that kind of optimism , however , is needed in the german music industry , which had one its worst years ever in 2003 , with sales down 20 percent from the year before .
the ratio of bought cds to those burned on home computers flip-flopped in just two years ' time .
in 2000 , 191 million pre-recorded cds were bought in germany , 133 million were burned by consumers .
by 2002 , the number of pre-recorded cd sales had sunk to 166 million and the number of burned cds had exploded to 259 million - a jump of 94 percent .
worldwide the numbers are similar .
global sales of cds , cassettes and records in 1993 amounted to $ 31.2 billion .
after climbing to a high of $ 39.8 billion in 1996 , the numbers began to plummet in 1999 .
by 2002 , worldwide sales stood at $ 32 billion , just above the 1993 figure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buying cds a study by the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that last year some six million internet surfers swapped more than eight billion songs on file swap sites like kazaa .
but industry officials say they may have turned a corner , and say sites like phonoline play an important role in their survival strategy .
according to them , 66 percent of consumers around the world know that unauthorized file-swapping is illegal .
the music catalog available to those who want to download their music legally is expanding ; it grew 30 percent in the last three months of 2003 .
ifpi says the demand for pay-per-download sites rose sharply last year .
competition from itunes in the u.s. , consumers have had the ability to pay for their music downloads for a year now .
according to apple computer , its " itunes music store " offers 30 million songs .
the company plans on bringing its successful model to europe and rumors have it that apple could be planning a launch date as soon as this spring .
if it does launch soon , and keeps its songs priced at 99 cents a piece , it could prove stiff competition to phonoline . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new copyright law gets tough on music pirates computer addicts nonchalantly offering and downloading music and films on the internet in germany now face legal crackdown as the country ’ s new copyright law comes into effect this weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.03.2004 german eurovision bid gets contemporary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among the competition on friday : berlin-based electropunk band mia .
after dismal performances in recent years at the eurovision song contest , germany 's steering clear of its kitsch pop crooners this year and instead teaming up with music channel viva to find a cooler act . eurovision , the popular annual europe-wide music event , has become something of a national embarrassment for germany in recent years .
not only has the country come away empty handed from the competition for the past 22 years , but the quality of its kitschy pop-singing candidates too has been in steady decline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou hoffner last year marked an all-time low with shock-haired , botox-injected lou hoffner -lrb- photo -rrb- coming in an agonizing 13th at the finals in latvia with her clap-your-hands ditty " let 's get happy " penned by none other than german veteran producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german eurovision candidates since 1976 - with only one lucky hit -rrb- . thumbs down for " schlagermusik " but things will be different , and many hope better , this year . as the contest to shortlist a german entry for this year 's eurovision in istanbul looms , the country 's competition organizers have decided to depart from decades of german " schlagermusik , " the sentimental , hand-swaying music often produced by siegel and often performed one-time eurovision crooner michelle , and bring in some new blood instead . in a first , public broadcaster ard has joined forces with the music television channel viva to search for slick young acts to fight it out at the preliminaries , which will be broadcast live on friday . eurovision organizer jürgen meier-beer has stressed that the german eurovision bid needed an image makeover . " we have to win back young spectators who we lost in the last preliminary contest .
after all , it 's the younger generation that determines international music trends , " he said . embracing a market-friendly policy the tie-up with viva has also changed the way germany sends candidates to its eurovision selection round . where once closed-door juries in the all-powerful music industry sent their favorites to the preliminaries , now it 's young music fans themselves who decide through their cd purchases which groups get to the selection . the idea is that record labels send videos of their artists to viva .
the channel then broadcasts the clips on a special weekly tv program called " euroclash , " giving the artists exposure . those who make it highest on the german charts go to the preliminaries . the new market-friendly concept has already ensured that " schlagermusik " fare is out of the running .
instead the finalist group features prominent artists and runs the gamut from techno , house , soul and electro pop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german rapper sabrina setlur techno group scooter , berlin-based electropunk band mia , mannheim-born half-iraqi pop singer laith al-deen , rapper sabrina setlur -lrb- photo -rrb- , house and techno dj westbam and afrika islam with his trademark techno à la hip hop style are among the 12 acts that will fight it out for a chance to represent germany in istanbul in may . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wins eurovision song contest turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu .

cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years . it might be too soon to speak of a comeback , but as representatives from technology companies all over the world descend on hanover for cebit , there 's a sense that just maybe , the worst is over . the high-tech industry suffered three rough years after the technology stock bubble burst .
that 's reflected in the figures for the world 's largest tech trade fair .
in 2001 , cebit attendance peaked with 8,100 exhibitors .
last year , that number was down to around 6,600 .
and while organizers expect 200 fewer exhibitors this year , they say that 's no reason to panic .
some of the decrease is due to the sluggish german economy , as the number of foreign firms attending has increased from last year . growth ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of consumers and industry representatives check out the latest it and computer trends each year at cebit .

german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a new internet platform for music by downloading the first song on thursday .
the german music industry hopes " phonoline " can help reverse its sagging fortunes . internet file swapping sites like kazaa and gnutella have become the archfiends of the music industry , blamed for the plummeting sales of pre-recorded cds and said to be driving a global business sector close to collapse .
now the industry in germany is fighting back , or at least offering an alternative to people who want to get their music digitally .
downloading kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german chancellor launched " phonoline " at the cebit computer trade fair in hanover .
phonoline is the german answer to itunes , the successful american pay-per-download site run by apple computer . it offers browsers 250,000 songs from a spectrum of different genres for download .
its operators say they hope to expand the catalog eventually to some 700,000 songs and say all the big industry labels , from universal music to bmg to sony , warner and emi , will have their artists represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britney spears madonna and christina aguilera the cost of a song ranges between € 1.19 to € 1.99 -lrb- $ 1.49 to $ 2.50 -rrb- , more expensive than the itunes price , 99 cents a song .
" the -lsb- phonoline -rsb- download is still more attractive than buying a whole cd , " klaus-peter schulenberg , head of cts eventim , one of phonoline 's partners , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
if the computer user wants the whole cd , he said the service will offer song package deals running between € 9.99 and € 16.99 -lrb- $ 12.50 and $ 21.25 -rrb- .
repeated delays phonoline was presented with great fanfare at last year 's popkomm music trade fair in cologne .
it was touted as a way to bring downloading lawbreakers back into the fold of legality and clip the wings of sites like kazaa .
then , there was much talk of phonoline being the first german site to offer a comprehensive platform including the music from both major and independent labels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popkomm the launch date was initially set for shortly after popkomm closed it doors last summer .
but months passed and the service remained offline .
a new date set for fall also came and went , since it had n't been decided who would be responsible for the technical side of the site .
phonoline missed the crucial christmas season as more details were ironed out .
" now there wo n't be any more delays , " said schulenberg . he hopes , despite the late start , to sell some five million songs online this year .
he admits it 's an ambitious goal .
an industry in trouble that kind of optimism , however , is needed in the german music industry , which had one its worst years ever in 2003 , with sales down 20 percent from the year before .
the ratio of bought cds to those burned on home computers flip-flopped in just two years ' time .
in 2000 , 191 million pre-recorded cds were bought in germany , 133 million were burned by consumers .
by 2002 , the number of pre-recorded cd sales had sunk to 166 million and the number of burned cds had exploded to 259 million - a jump of 94 percent .
worldwide the numbers are similar .
global sales of cds , cassettes and records in 1993 amounted to $ 31.2 billion .
after climbing to a high of $ 39.8 billion in 1996 , the numbers began to plummet in 1999 .
by 2002 , worldwide sales stood at $ 32 billion , just above the 1993 figure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buying cds a study by the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that last year some six million internet surfers swapped more than eight billion songs on file swap sites like kazaa .
but industry officials say they may have turned a corner , and say sites like phonoline play an important role in their survival strategy .
according to them , 66 percent of consumers around the world know that unauthorized file-swapping is illegal .
the music catalog available to those who want to download their music legally is expanding ; it grew 30 percent in the last three months of 2003 .
ifpi says the demand for pay-per-download sites rose sharply last year .
competition from itunes in the u.s. , consumers have had the ability to pay for their music downloads for a year now .
according to apple computer , its " itunes music store " offers 30 million songs .
the company plans on bringing its successful model to europe and rumors have it that apple could be planning a launch date as soon as this spring .
if it does launch soon , and keeps its songs priced at 99 cents a piece , it could prove stiff competition to phonoline . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new copyright law gets tough on music pirates computer addicts nonchalantly offering and downloading music and films on the internet in germany now face legal crackdown as the country ’ s new copyright law comes into effect this weekend .

cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years . it might be too soon to speak of a comeback , but as representatives from technology companies all over the world descend on hanover for cebit , there 's a sense that just maybe , the worst is over . the high-tech industry suffered three rough years after the technology stock bubble burst .
that 's reflected in the figures for the world 's largest tech trade fair .
in 2001 , cebit attendance peaked with 8,100 exhibitors .
last year , that number was down to around 6,600 .
and while organizers expect 200 fewer exhibitors this year , they say that 's no reason to panic .

not only has the country come away empty handed from the competition for the past 22 years , but the quality of its kitschy pop-singing candidates too has been in steady decline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou hoffner last year marked an all-time low with shock-haired , botox-injected lou hoffner -lrb- photo -rrb- coming in an agonizing 13th at the finals in latvia with her clap-your-hands ditty " let 's get happy " penned by none other than german veteran producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german eurovision candidates since 1976 - with only one lucky hit -rrb- . thumbs down for " schlagermusik " but things will be different , and many hope better , this year . as the contest to shortlist a german entry for this year 's eurovision in istanbul looms , the country 's competition organizers have decided to depart from decades of german " schlagermusik , " the sentimental , hand-swaying music often produced by siegel and often performed one-time eurovision crooner michelle , and bring in some new blood instead . in a first , public broadcaster ard has joined forces with the music television channel viva to search for slick young acts to fight it out at the preliminaries , which will be broadcast live on friday . eurovision organizer jürgen meier-beer has stressed that the german eurovision bid needed an image makeover . " we have to win back young spectators who we lost in the last preliminary contest .
after all , it 's the younger generation that determines international music trends , " he said . embracing a market-friendly policy the tie-up with viva has also changed the way germany sends candidates to its eurovision selection round . where once closed-door juries in the all-powerful music industry sent their favorites to the preliminaries , now it 's young music fans themselves who decide through their cd purchases which groups get to the selection . the idea is that record labels send videos of their artists to viva .
the channel then broadcasts the clips on a special weekly tv program called " euroclash , " giving the artists exposure . those who make it highest on the german charts go to the preliminaries . the new market-friendly concept has already ensured that " schlagermusik " fare is out of the running .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2004 poland rekindles hopes of eu constitution deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all is not lost yet .
taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved . just three months after the disastrous breakdown of eu constitution talks in brussels , hope is stirring among member states that the treaty might yet see the light of the day . on friday , poland indicated that it was willing to compromise and that warsaw would no longer stand in the way of a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski in an interview with german business daily financial times deutschland , polish president alexander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he found the new weighting of the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency " an important and interesting idea " and one that " should be reflected over . " kwasniewski said that " before the brussels summit -lrb- last december -rrb- , there was no room for compromise " and added " but now there 's a new situation . " while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .
" i think we can reach an agreement which will maintain the balance of power for an enlarged europe , " he said . moving away from entrenched stance the constitution , drafted by the convention chaired by the former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , is designed to give the eu a new president and foreign minister , streamline decision-making in a union of 25 members and attempt to make the eu more democratically accountable and transparent .
both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .
fears of isolation in warsaw there were further signs this week that poland , which joins the eu in may , is serious about reaching a deal on the constitution and wary of being isolated in its refusal to accept plans to change the voting system .
josef oleksy , poland 's deputy prime minister said , " i think the starting point should be an acceptance of the principle of a double majority . "
polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .
" for an individual loneliness is a very unpleasant mental state , " miller said .
" for a country it would be very dangerous . "

taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved . just three months after the disastrous breakdown of eu constitution talks in brussels , hope is stirring among member states that the treaty might yet see the light of the day . on friday , poland indicated that it was willing to compromise and that warsaw would no longer stand in the way of a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski in an interview with german business daily financial times deutschland , polish president alexander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he found the new weighting of the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency " an important and interesting idea " and one that " should be reflected over . " kwasniewski said that " before the brussels summit -lrb- last december -rrb- , there was no room for compromise " and added " but now there 's a new situation . " while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .
" i think we can reach an agreement which will maintain the balance of power for an enlarged europe , " he said . moving away from entrenched stance the constitution , drafted by the convention chaired by the former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , is designed to give the eu a new president and foreign minister , streamline decision-making in a union of 25 members and attempt to make the eu more democratically accountable and transparent .
both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .
fears of isolation in warsaw there were further signs this week that poland , which joins the eu in may , is serious about reaching a deal on the constitution and wary of being isolated in its refusal to accept plans to change the voting system .
josef oleksy , poland 's deputy prime minister said , " i think the starting point should be an acceptance of the principle of a double majority . "
polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .

the five men detained on suspicion of involvement in the madrid bombings appeared in court on friday and were accused of terrorist crimes .
meanwhile , the investigation swept far and wide with arrests made across europe . the five men arrested in connection with the madrid bombings appeared in the spanish capital 's high court on friday where they were accused of terrorist crimes .
the three moroccans and two indians repeatedly denied any involvement with al qaeda throughout the seven-hour hearing which took place overnight and ended at 4 a.m.
-lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- on friday morning . the suspects all maintain that they were asleep at home when bombs exploded on four packed commuter trains in madrid on march 11 , killing 202 people and injuring some 1,816 others .
the attacks were the bloodiest since the bali bombings in 2002 which killed a similar number of people when a series of car bombs went off in the crowded tourist areas on the indonesian island . suspects deny links to al qaeda " the five detainees have denied any involvement ...
they have all said that when the attack took place on march 11 they were sleeping in their respective homes , " a court source said .
" they say they do n't have any link with al qaeda or any terrorist organization . " the moroccans - jamal zougam , his brother mohamed chaoui and mohamed bekkali - were accused of 190 murders and belonging to a terrorist group .
the counts of murder attributed to the group are thought to come from the number of identified victims at this time .

four north africans and a spaniard were arrested in spain on thursday and are expected to appear in court next week .
the spaniard , captured near oviedo in northern spain , is suspected of stealing the locally-made explosives used . elsewhere investigators are pursuing possible links between the madrid attack and the may 2003 suicide bombings in casablanca , morocco , that killed 45 people .
in belgium on friday , anti-terrorist police arrested a suspect wanted in connection with the casablanca bombings after raids across the country . the police raided 20 properties in cities across belgium , including brussels and antwerp , as part of an investigation into north african individuals who had undergone paramilitary training in camps in afghanistan , according to a police statement . casablanca link under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four explosions tore through casablanca killing 20 people .
" one of the people arrested is the subject of an international alert by moroccan authorities following the attack in casablanca on may 15 , 2003 , " the statement read , adding that police had also seized suspicious documents . the investigation into the militant organization , the moroccan islamic combat group -lrb- gmic -rrb- had been stepped up in the wake of the madrid bombings when the identity of some of those detained in connection with the attacks caused alarm .
jamal zougam reportedly left morocco three weeks after the casablanca suicide attacks .

taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved . just three months after the disastrous breakdown of eu constitution talks in brussels , hope is stirring among member states that the treaty might yet see the light of the day . on friday , poland indicated that it was willing to compromise and that warsaw would no longer stand in the way of a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski in an interview with german business daily financial times deutschland , polish president alexander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he found the new weighting of the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency " an important and interesting idea " and one that " should be reflected over . " kwasniewski said that " before the brussels summit -lrb- last december -rrb- , there was no room for compromise " and added " but now there 's a new situation . " while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .
" i think we can reach an agreement which will maintain the balance of power for an enlarged europe , " he said . moving away from entrenched stance the constitution , drafted by the convention chaired by the former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , is designed to give the eu a new president and foreign minister , streamline decision-making in a union of 25 members and attempt to make the eu more democratically accountable and transparent .
both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .
fears of isolation in warsaw there were further signs this week that poland , which joins the eu in may , is serious about reaching a deal on the constitution and wary of being isolated in its refusal to accept plans to change the voting system .
josef oleksy , poland 's deputy prime minister said , " i think the starting point should be an acceptance of the principle of a double majority . "
polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .
" for an individual loneliness is a very unpleasant mental state , " miller said .
" for a country it would be very dangerous . "
miller added he would suggest to bertie ahern , the irish holder of the rotating eu presidency , that talks on the constitution should be renewed at next week 's summit in brussels . compromise could repair frayed eu ties the change of stance in madrid and warsaw is not just expected to be welcomed by brussels , but also help repair relations between eu members , which soured as a result of the iraq war .
both poland and spain supported the u.s. in iraq much to the displeasure of germany and france , both of whom staunchly opposed the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder incoming spanish premier zapatero promised " close and trusty " cooperation with france and germany during a telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- .
even polish president kwasniewski said that a planned visit by schröder to poland next week was " likely to be decisive for a relaunching of negotiations -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- . "
though it 's clear it will be impossible to reach a final deal before may 1 when the eu expands to take in ten new mainly former communist eastern european states , the widespread view is that ireland stands a better chance of forging an agreement than the dutch , who take over the presidency at the end of june .

both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .
fears of isolation in warsaw there were further signs this week that poland , which joins the eu in may , is serious about reaching a deal on the constitution and wary of being isolated in its refusal to accept plans to change the voting system .

polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .
" for an individual loneliness is a very unpleasant mental state , " miller said .
" for a country it would be very dangerous . "
miller added he would suggest to bertie ahern , the irish holder of the rotating eu presidency , that talks on the constitution should be renewed at next week 's summit in brussels . compromise could repair frayed eu ties the change of stance in madrid and warsaw is not just expected to be welcomed by brussels , but also help repair relations between eu members , which soured as a result of the iraq war .

taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved . just three months after the disastrous breakdown of eu constitution talks in brussels , hope is stirring among member states that the treaty might yet see the light of the day . on friday , poland indicated that it was willing to compromise and that warsaw would no longer stand in the way of a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski in an interview with german business daily financial times deutschland , polish president alexander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he found the new weighting of the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency " an important and interesting idea " and one that " should be reflected over . " kwasniewski said that " before the brussels summit -lrb- last december -rrb- , there was no room for compromise " and added " but now there 's a new situation . " while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .

" it 's not a question of reinventing the wheel in relation to how we deal with terrorism … , it 's a question of making the wheel turn a bit faster , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , said on thursday .
increasing cooperation the ministers may call for establishment of an eu coordinator for counter-terrorism , who would be responsible for bringing together security measures taken in transport , justice , foreign affairs and finance in the member states . the action plan drafted by eu justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino suggests increasing cooperation and the exchange of information between national intelligence agencies , police and public prosecutors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol logo but several states are likely to resist austria and belgium 's call for the creation of a european central intelligence agency .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac have already dismissed the suggestion .
instead , the ministers will probably decide to strengthen europol , the european law enforcement organization . vitorino 's list of measures includes freezing terrorists ' bank accounts and establishing a pan-eu database of terrorists ' criminal records .
the ministers are also likely to issue a declaration of solidarity with spain .
sluggish tempo eu interior ministers ' convened for an emergency meeting in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington and agreed on a series of measures to fight terrorism , but most of them have yet to be enacted . the european commission said on thursday that five eu countries had still not passed the european arrest warrant in their national parliaments .
several countries are also dragging their feet when it comes to adopting eu minimum and maximum sentences for terrorists and a common definition of terrorism .
and 11 of the 15 eu members have not yet passed laws to allow police to make cross-border requests to eavesdrop on communications and monitor bank accounts . it 's also questionable whether the meeting will actually result in changes on the ground .
intelligence agencies are notoriously secretive and reluctant to cooperate with each other . spanish interior minister angel acebes is set to brief his eu counterparts on friday on the ongoing investigation into the madrid bombings .
the spanish authorities have been accused of withholding or even providing misleading information to the german intelligence agency bka suggesting that the basque separatist organization eta was responsible for the attacks .
german officials were thus unable to assess the security situation or aid in the investigation . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to revamp domestic intelligence service federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week .

cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years . it might be too soon to speak of a comeback , but as representatives from technology companies all over the world descend on hanover for cebit , there 's a sense that just maybe , the worst is over . the high-tech industry suffered three rough years after the technology stock bubble burst .

" it 's not a question of reinventing the wheel in relation to how we deal with terrorism … , it 's a question of making the wheel turn a bit faster , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , said on thursday .
increasing cooperation the ministers may call for establishment of an eu coordinator for counter-terrorism , who would be responsible for bringing together security measures taken in transport , justice , foreign affairs and finance in the member states . the action plan drafted by eu justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino suggests increasing cooperation and the exchange of information between national intelligence agencies , police and public prosecutors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol logo but several states are likely to resist austria and belgium 's call for the creation of a european central intelligence agency .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac have already dismissed the suggestion .
instead , the ministers will probably decide to strengthen europol , the european law enforcement organization . vitorino 's list of measures includes freezing terrorists ' bank accounts and establishing a pan-eu database of terrorists ' criminal records .
the ministers are also likely to issue a declaration of solidarity with spain .
sluggish tempo eu interior ministers ' convened for an emergency meeting in the aftermath of the sept .

and 11 of the 15 eu members have not yet passed laws to allow police to make cross-border requests to eavesdrop on communications and monitor bank accounts . it 's also questionable whether the meeting will actually result in changes on the ground .
intelligence agencies are notoriously secretive and reluctant to cooperate with each other . spanish interior minister angel acebes is set to brief his eu counterparts on friday on the ongoing investigation into the madrid bombings .
the spanish authorities have been accused of withholding or even providing misleading information to the german intelligence agency bka suggesting that the basque separatist organization eta was responsible for the attacks .

taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved . just three months after the disastrous breakdown of eu constitution talks in brussels , hope is stirring among member states that the treaty might yet see the light of the day . on friday , poland indicated that it was willing to compromise and that warsaw would no longer stand in the way of a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski in an interview with german business daily financial times deutschland , polish president alexander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he found the new weighting of the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency " an important and interesting idea " and one that " should be reflected over .

both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .

polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .
" for an individual loneliness is a very unpleasant mental state , " miller said .
" for a country it would be very dangerous . "
miller added he would suggest to bertie ahern , the irish holder of the rotating eu presidency , that talks on the constitution should be renewed at next week 's summit in brussels . compromise could repair frayed eu ties the change of stance in madrid and warsaw is not just expected to be welcomed by brussels , but also help repair relations between eu members , which soured as a result of the iraq war .

" it 's not a question of reinventing the wheel in relation to how we deal with terrorism … , it 's a question of making the wheel turn a bit faster , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , said on thursday .
increasing cooperation the ministers may call for establishment of an eu coordinator for counter-terrorism , who would be responsible for bringing together security measures taken in transport , justice , foreign affairs and finance in the member states . the action plan drafted by eu justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino suggests increasing cooperation and the exchange of information between national intelligence agencies , police and public prosecutors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol logo but several states are likely to resist austria and belgium 's call for the creation of a european central intelligence agency .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac have already dismissed the suggestion .
instead , the ministers will probably decide to strengthen europol , the european law enforcement organization . vitorino 's list of measures includes freezing terrorists ' bank accounts and establishing a pan-eu database of terrorists ' criminal records .
the ministers are also likely to issue a declaration of solidarity with spain .

and 11 of the 15 eu members have not yet passed laws to allow police to make cross-border requests to eavesdrop on communications and monitor bank accounts . it 's also questionable whether the meeting will actually result in changes on the ground .
intelligence agencies are notoriously secretive and reluctant to cooperate with each other . spanish interior minister angel acebes is set to brief his eu counterparts on friday on the ongoing investigation into the madrid bombings .
the spanish authorities have been accused of withholding or even providing misleading information to the german intelligence agency bka suggesting that the basque separatist organization eta was responsible for the attacks .

taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved . just three months after the disastrous breakdown of eu constitution talks in brussels , hope is stirring among member states that the treaty might yet see the light of the day . on friday , poland indicated that it was willing to compromise and that warsaw would no longer stand in the way of a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski in an interview with german business daily financial times deutschland , polish president alexander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he found the new weighting of the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency " an important and interesting idea " and one that " should be reflected over . " kwasniewski said that " before the brussels summit -lrb- last december -rrb- , there was no room for compromise " and added " but now there 's a new situation . " while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .
" i think we can reach an agreement which will maintain the balance of power for an enlarged europe , " he said . moving away from entrenched stance the constitution , drafted by the convention chaired by the former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , is designed to give the eu a new president and foreign minister , streamline decision-making in a union of 25 members and attempt to make the eu more democratically accountable and transparent .
both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .
fears of isolation in warsaw there were further signs this week that poland , which joins the eu in may , is serious about reaching a deal on the constitution and wary of being isolated in its refusal to accept plans to change the voting system .
josef oleksy , poland 's deputy prime minister said , " i think the starting point should be an acceptance of the principle of a double majority . "
polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .

the five men detained on suspicion of involvement in the madrid bombings appeared in court on friday and were accused of terrorist crimes .
meanwhile , the investigation swept far and wide with arrests made across europe . the five men arrested in connection with the madrid bombings appeared in the spanish capital 's high court on friday where they were accused of terrorist crimes .
the three moroccans and two indians repeatedly denied any involvement with al qaeda throughout the seven-hour hearing which took place overnight and ended at 4 a.m.
-lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- on friday morning . the suspects all maintain that they were asleep at home when bombs exploded on four packed commuter trains in madrid on march 11 , killing 202 people and injuring some 1,816 others .
the attacks were the bloodiest since the bali bombings in 2002 which killed a similar number of people when a series of car bombs went off in the crowded tourist areas on the indonesian island . suspects deny links to al qaeda " the five detainees have denied any involvement ...
they have all said that when the attack took place on march 11 they were sleeping in their respective homes , " a court source said .
" they say they do n't have any link with al qaeda or any terrorist organization . " the moroccans - jamal zougam , his brother mohamed chaoui and mohamed bekkali - were accused of 190 murders and belonging to a terrorist group .
the counts of murder attributed to the group are thought to come from the number of identified victims at this time .
that figure could increase in the coming days .
they were also accused of 1,400 attempted murders , a figure which approaches the number of wounded , four " terrorist acts " , presumably one for each train bombed , and stealing a vehicle . zougam , considered to be one of the main suspects in the bombings , wept in court before being returned to his cell where he reportedly prayed . the indians , suresh kumar and vinay khohy , were accused of cooperating with a terrorist group and forging documents .
the court ordered that all five would be held in custody and were taken to soto de real jail , just north of madrid where it is believed they were being held in solitary confinement . formal charges to follow initial hearing under the spanish legal system , the accusations leveled at the suspects points to the fact that the court considers there is a case to answer , providing grounds to keep them in custody .

the men were detained after investigators followed up leads associated with the discovery of a stolen mobile phone in a bag along with a bomb that failed to go off on the morning of the bombings . raids on moroccan group across europe meanwhile , the investigation into the bombings continues .
four north africans and a spaniard were arrested in spain on thursday and are expected to appear in court next week .
the spaniard , captured near oviedo in northern spain , is suspected of stealing the locally-made explosives used . elsewhere investigators are pursuing possible links between the madrid attack and the may 2003 suicide bombings in casablanca , morocco , that killed 45 people .
in belgium on friday , anti-terrorist police arrested a suspect wanted in connection with the casablanca bombings after raids across the country . the police raided 20 properties in cities across belgium , including brussels and antwerp , as part of an investigation into north african individuals who had undergone paramilitary training in camps in afghanistan , according to a police statement . casablanca link under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four explosions tore through casablanca killing 20 people .
" one of the people arrested is the subject of an international alert by moroccan authorities following the attack in casablanca on may 15 , 2003 , " the statement read , adding that police had also seized suspicious documents . the investigation into the militant organization , the moroccan islamic combat group -lrb- gmic -rrb- had been stepped up in the wake of the madrid bombings when the identity of some of those detained in connection with the attacks caused alarm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2004 eu ministers debate counter-terrorism measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for change : national police forces have been poor at sharing information in the past european union interior ministers are meeting in brussels on friday to discuss how to deal with terror in the wake of last week 's madrid terrorist attacks . during the emergency talks called by german interior minister otto schily after the spanish attacks that killed over 200 people , eu member countries will examine ways to fight terrorism . no real shake-ups are expected from the meeting , nor are many new ideas likely to surface . " it 's not a question of reinventing the wheel in relation to how we deal with terrorism … , it 's a question of making the wheel turn a bit faster , " irish foreign minister brian cowen , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , said on thursday .
increasing cooperation the ministers may call for establishment of an eu coordinator for counter-terrorism , who would be responsible for bringing together security measures taken in transport , justice , foreign affairs and finance in the member states . the action plan drafted by eu justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino suggests increasing cooperation and the exchange of information between national intelligence agencies , police and public prosecutors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol logo but several states are likely to resist austria and belgium 's call for the creation of a european central intelligence agency .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac have already dismissed the suggestion .
instead , the ministers will probably decide to strengthen europol , the european law enforcement organization . vitorino 's list of measures includes freezing terrorists ' bank accounts and establishing a pan-eu database of terrorists ' criminal records .
the ministers are also likely to issue a declaration of solidarity with spain .
sluggish tempo eu interior ministers ' convened for an emergency meeting in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington and agreed on a series of measures to fight terrorism , but most of them have yet to be enacted . the european commission said on thursday that five eu countries had still not passed the european arrest warrant in their national parliaments .
several countries are also dragging their feet when it comes to adopting eu minimum and maximum sentences for terrorists and a common definition of terrorism .
and 11 of the 15 eu members have not yet passed laws to allow police to make cross-border requests to eavesdrop on communications and monitor bank accounts . it 's also questionable whether the meeting will actually result in changes on the ground .
intelligence agencies are notoriously secretive and reluctant to cooperate with each other . spanish interior minister angel acebes is set to brief his eu counterparts on friday on the ongoing investigation into the madrid bombings .
the spanish authorities have been accused of withholding or even providing misleading information to the german intelligence agency bka suggesting that the basque separatist organization eta was responsible for the attacks .
german officials were thus unable to assess the security situation or aid in the investigation . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to revamp domestic intelligence service federal and regional german politicians are working on plans to overhaul the country 's domestic intelligence service to be better able to combat terrorism and avoid attacks similar to the madrid bombings last week .

taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved . just three months after the disastrous breakdown of eu constitution talks in brussels , hope is stirring among member states that the treaty might yet see the light of the day . on friday , poland indicated that it was willing to compromise and that warsaw would no longer stand in the way of a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski in an interview with german business daily financial times deutschland , polish president alexander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he found the new weighting of the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency " an important and interesting idea " and one that " should be reflected over . " kwasniewski said that " before the brussels summit -lrb- last december -rrb- , there was no room for compromise " and added " but now there 's a new situation . " while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .
" i think we can reach an agreement which will maintain the balance of power for an enlarged europe , " he said . moving away from entrenched stance the constitution , drafted by the convention chaired by the former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , is designed to give the eu a new president and foreign minister , streamline decision-making in a union of 25 members and attempt to make the eu more democratically accountable and transparent .
both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .
fears of isolation in warsaw there were further signs this week that poland , which joins the eu in may , is serious about reaching a deal on the constitution and wary of being isolated in its refusal to accept plans to change the voting system .
josef oleksy , poland 's deputy prime minister said , " i think the starting point should be an acceptance of the principle of a double majority . "
polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .
" for an individual loneliness is a very unpleasant mental state , " miller said .
" for a country it would be very dangerous . "
miller added he would suggest to bertie ahern , the irish holder of the rotating eu presidency , that talks on the constitution should be renewed at next week 's summit in brussels . compromise could repair frayed eu ties the change of stance in madrid and warsaw is not just expected to be welcomed by brussels , but also help repair relations between eu members , which soured as a result of the iraq war .

even polish president kwasniewski said that a planned visit by schröder to poland next week was " likely to be decisive for a relaunching of negotiations -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- . "
though it 's clear it will be impossible to reach a final deal before may 1 when the eu expands to take in ten new mainly former communist eastern european states , the widespread view is that ireland stands a better chance of forging an agreement than the dutch , who take over the presidency at the end of june .

" kwasniewski said that " before the brussels summit -lrb- last december -rrb- , there was no room for compromise " and added " but now there 's a new situation . " while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .
" i think we can reach an agreement which will maintain the balance of power for an enlarged europe , " he said . moving away from entrenched stance the constitution , drafted by the convention chaired by the former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , is designed to give the eu a new president and foreign minister , streamline decision-making in a union of 25 members and attempt to make the eu more democratically accountable and transparent .
both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .
fears of isolation in warsaw there were further signs this week that poland , which joins the eu in may , is serious about reaching a deal on the constitution and wary of being isolated in its refusal to accept plans to change the voting system .
josef oleksy , poland 's deputy prime minister said , " i think the starting point should be an acceptance of the principle of a double majority . "
polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .
" for an individual loneliness is a very unpleasant mental state , " miller said .
" for a country it would be very dangerous . "
miller added he would suggest to bertie ahern , the irish holder of the rotating eu presidency , that talks on the constitution should be renewed at next week 's summit in brussels . compromise could repair frayed eu ties the change of stance in madrid and warsaw is not just expected to be welcomed by brussels , but also help repair relations between eu members , which soured as a result of the iraq war .
both poland and spain supported the u.s. in iraq much to the displeasure of germany and france , both of whom staunchly opposed the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder incoming spanish premier zapatero promised " close and trusty " cooperation with france and germany during a telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- .
even polish president kwasniewski said that a planned visit by schröder to poland next week was " likely to be decisive for a relaunching of negotiations -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- . "
though it 's clear it will be impossible to reach a final deal before may 1 when the eu expands to take in ten new mainly former communist eastern european states , the widespread view is that ireland stands a better chance of forging an agreement than the dutch , who take over the presidency at the end of june .
irish officials say they are " hopeful " of a positive outcome . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape dw-world 's special on the eu constitution debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.03.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc schröder pushes for permanent german seat on un security council german chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that his country should be allotted a permanent seat on the un security council .
african , asian and latin american states that play a central role should be accorded a seat on the body along with the industrial countries that " render a significant contribution to protect world peace and international security , " schröder said in a speech in berlin on friday .
he added that germany thus sees itself as a candidate for a permanent position on the un 's exclusive top body .

in their first public appearance , the initiators of the " work and social justice " alliance criticized the spd on friday , saying it had turned its back on the concept of solidarity and justice with its " agenda 2010 " package of social and economic reforms .
if the policies are n't changed , the group might found a new political party , the initiators said .
they would decide over the course of the year whether to do so , hamburg economics professor herbert shui , one of the seven initiators , said .
all of the initiators are members of the ig metall trade union , except shui .
six of the seven are spd members , who now face a ban from the spd for their actions . more briefs 19.03.2004 -pipe- schröder pushes for permanent german seat on un security council 19.03.2004 -pipe- court evicts woman for wearing headscarf 19.03.2004 -pipe- bavaria pays off angry lederhosen fans 18.03.2004 -pipe- muslim body criticizes growing discrimination 18.03.2004 -pipe- liberals reject new anti-terror law 18.03.2004 -pipe- minister blames industry for emissions dispute 17.03.2004 -pipe- clement puts brakes on emissions compromise 17.03.2004 -pipe- german conservatives in disarray over köhler nomination radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

african , asian and latin american states that play a central role should be accorded a seat on the body along with the industrial countries that " render a significant contribution to protect world peace and international security , " schröder said in a speech in berlin on friday .
he added that germany thus sees itself as a candidate for a permanent position on the un 's exclusive top body .
schröder said france , russia and japan , among others supported such a move and that the united states was sure to do so as well in light of germany 's efforts in the fight against international terrorism .
only the britain , china , france , russia and the united states have permanent seats on the security council , while ten seats rotate every two years between the remaining un members .
germany has held a temporary seat since 2003 . more briefs 19.03.2004 -pipe- court evicts woman for wearing headscarf 19.03.2004 -pipe- bavaria pays off angry lederhosen fans 18.03.2004 -pipe- muslim body criticizes growing discrimination 18.03.2004 -pipe- liberals reject new anti-terror law 18.03.2004 -pipe- minister blames industry for emissions dispute 17.03.2004 -pipe- clement puts brakes on emissions compromise 17.03.2004 -pipe- german conservatives in disarray over köhler nomination 17.03.2004 -pipe- " florida rolf " to draw pension instead of dole radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the turks could then enter the eu around ten years later .
this would rule out starting negotiations next year , as turkey expects .
bolkestein stressed that a rejection of turkish membership at this stage would be unjust .
" you can not tell a country which has applied for membership 40 years ago , ' sorry , we 're closed , " ' he said .
" that would be an unseemly policy . "
turkey has had an association treaty with the eu since 1963 .
the treaty was meant to " facilitate the accession of turkey to the -lsb- european -rsb- community at a later date . "
bolkestein appears to have changed his views on the subject .
in his recently published book " the limits of europe " , the dutch commissioner still suggested that turkey should stay out of the eu by writing that turkey should act as a " buffer " protecting europe from syria , iran and iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc solana slams eu 's anti-terror measures eu 's chief diplomat javier solana listed a whole host of inadequacies on the part of member states in the battle against terrorism , french daily le monde reported : decisions adopted at eu level are not implemented in the member states , there is a lack of co-ordination between eu institutions and member states , intelligence services do not co-operate , member states prefer to act bilaterally than collectively .
furthermore , political dialogue between the eu and third parties such as the us " produce few concrete results " , according to the document and " the objectives pursued by the eu are often imprecise and unclear . "

furthermore , political dialogue between the eu and third parties such as the us " produce few concrete results " , according to the document and " the objectives pursued by the eu are often imprecise and unclear . "
but solana stressed that the fight against terrorism is the responsibility of the member states and that the eu should only play a part when it can bring " added value " and " tangible results . "
the document will be used as the backdrop for discussions between ministers at the summit of european leaders and ministers on march 25 and 26 .

taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved . just three months after the disastrous breakdown of eu constitution talks in brussels , hope is stirring among member states that the treaty might yet see the light of the day . on friday , poland indicated that it was willing to compromise and that warsaw would no longer stand in the way of a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski in an interview with german business daily financial times deutschland , polish president alexander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he found the new weighting of the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency " an important and interesting idea " and one that " should be reflected over . " kwasniewski said that " before the brussels summit -lrb- last december -rrb- , there was no room for compromise " and added " but now there 's a new situation . " while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .
" i think we can reach an agreement which will maintain the balance of power for an enlarged europe , " he said . moving away from entrenched stance the constitution , drafted by the convention chaired by the former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , is designed to give the eu a new president and foreign minister , streamline decision-making in a union of 25 members and attempt to make the eu more democratically accountable and transparent .
both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .
fears of isolation in warsaw there were further signs this week that poland , which joins the eu in may , is serious about reaching a deal on the constitution and wary of being isolated in its refusal to accept plans to change the voting system .
josef oleksy , poland 's deputy prime minister said , " i think the starting point should be an acceptance of the principle of a double majority . "
polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .
" for an individual loneliness is a very unpleasant mental state , " miller said .
" for a country it would be very dangerous . "
miller added he would suggest to bertie ahern , the irish holder of the rotating eu presidency , that talks on the constitution should be renewed at next week 's summit in brussels . compromise could repair frayed eu ties the change of stance in madrid and warsaw is not just expected to be welcomed by brussels , but also help repair relations between eu members , which soured as a result of the iraq war .
both poland and spain supported the u.s. in iraq much to the displeasure of germany and france , both of whom staunchly opposed the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder incoming spanish premier zapatero promised " close and trusty " cooperation with france and germany during a telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- .
even polish president kwasniewski said that a planned visit by schröder to poland next week was " likely to be decisive for a relaunching of negotiations -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- . "
though it 's clear it will be impossible to reach a final deal before may 1 when the eu expands to take in ten new mainly former communist eastern european states , the widespread view is that ireland stands a better chance of forging an agreement than the dutch , who take over the presidency at the end of june .

" '
a literary-stimulating diversion has arrived for german smokers weary of staring at death warnings on their cigarette packs -a thin cardboard jacket inscribed with a brief story .
hail the advent of the " cigarette novel . " so you 've bought your pack of marlboro at the corner shop , lit up , and you 're now waiting for the bus .
it 's late , you 're impatient and bored .
you ca n't read the paper tucked under your arm because your hands are full .
and you 're read the billboards around a million times .
your eyes invariably stray to the " smoking leads to impotence " warning blazing on your marlboro pack .
you hastily avert them and instead take another drag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarette warnings in germany the next time you 're in a situation like that , you might consider shelling out an extra € 2 and buying a thin cardboard cover inscribed with , yes , a whole story !
ten lines on the front and another ten on the back . slip that on your pack and voila , there 's entertainment for you .
you can immerse yourself in a quick good fictitious read by popular german writers like russian-born wladimir kaminer and doris dörrie as you take a leisurely smoke and wait for the tube . the brainchild of munich-based publishing house blumenbar , the so-called " cigarette novel " introduced this month promises to deal with the inexhaustible grand themes of literature like love and death .
for instance famous german columnist and author maxim biller 's episode called " melody " opens with the dramatically sweeping statement , " when thomas and melody fell in love , eva had been dead for just two months . " the publishers are talking of breaking ground with a whole new untapped literary genre and are hoping that the compact pocket-sized stories might eventually becoming collectors ' items and take place of pride on bookshelves . but for most german smokers , the idea is more likely to come in handy for camouflaging those nasty " smokers die earlier " and " smoking causes fatal lung cancer " signs issued by the health ministry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the five men detained on suspicion of involvement in the madrid bombings appeared in court on friday and were accused of terrorist crimes .
meanwhile , the investigation swept far and wide with arrests made across europe . the five men arrested in connection with the madrid bombings appeared in the spanish capital 's high court on friday where they were accused of terrorist crimes .
the three moroccans and two indians repeatedly denied any involvement with al qaeda throughout the seven-hour hearing which took place overnight and ended at 4 a.m.
-lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- on friday morning . the suspects all maintain that they were asleep at home when bombs exploded on four packed commuter trains in madrid on march 11 , killing 202 people and injuring some 1,816 others .
the attacks were the bloodiest since the bali bombings in 2002 which killed a similar number of people when a series of car bombs went off in the crowded tourist areas on the indonesian island . suspects deny links to al qaeda " the five detainees have denied any involvement ...
they have all said that when the attack took place on march 11 they were sleeping in their respective homes , " a court source said .
" they say they do n't have any link with al qaeda or any terrorist organization . " the moroccans - jamal zougam , his brother mohamed chaoui and mohamed bekkali - were accused of 190 murders and belonging to a terrorist group .
the counts of murder attributed to the group are thought to come from the number of identified victims at this time .
that figure could increase in the coming days .
they were also accused of 1,400 attempted murders , a figure which approaches the number of wounded , four " terrorist acts " , presumably one for each train bombed , and stealing a vehicle . zougam , considered to be one of the main suspects in the bombings , wept in court before being returned to his cell where he reportedly prayed . the indians , suresh kumar and vinay khohy , were accused of cooperating with a terrorist group and forging documents .
the court ordered that all five would be held in custody and were taken to soto de real jail , just north of madrid where it is believed they were being held in solitary confinement . formal charges to follow initial hearing under the spanish legal system , the accusations leveled at the suspects points to the fact that the court considers there is a case to answer , providing grounds to keep them in custody .
a decision on formal charges will be taken at a later date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy walks past the nuevo siglo telephone calling center in madrid .
the three moroccans were all arrested in a telephone shop run by zougam in madrid .
the men were detained after investigators followed up leads associated with the discovery of a stolen mobile phone in a bag along with a bomb that failed to go off on the morning of the bombings . raids on moroccan group across europe meanwhile , the investigation into the bombings continues .
four north africans and a spaniard were arrested in spain on thursday and are expected to appear in court next week .
the spaniard , captured near oviedo in northern spain , is suspected of stealing the locally-made explosives used . elsewhere investigators are pursuing possible links between the madrid attack and the may 2003 suicide bombings in casablanca , morocco , that killed 45 people .
in belgium on friday , anti-terrorist police arrested a suspect wanted in connection with the casablanca bombings after raids across the country . the police raided 20 properties in cities across belgium , including brussels and antwerp , as part of an investigation into north african individuals who had undergone paramilitary training in camps in afghanistan , according to a police statement . casablanca link under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four explosions tore through casablanca killing 20 people .
" one of the people arrested is the subject of an international alert by moroccan authorities following the attack in casablanca on may 15 , 2003 , " the statement read , adding that police had also seized suspicious documents . the investigation into the militant organization , the moroccan islamic combat group -lrb- gmic -rrb- had been stepped up in the wake of the madrid bombings when the identity of some of those detained in connection with the attacks caused alarm .
jamal zougam reportedly left morocco three weeks after the casablanca suicide attacks .
morocco has investigators in spain helping in the madrid investigation , according to officials in rabat , suggesting that links with the gmic were being taken very seriously . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda terror comes to europe ?

african , asian and latin american states that play a central role should be accorded a seat on the body along with the industrial countries that " render a significant contribution to protect world peace and international security , " schröder said in a speech in berlin on friday .
he added that germany thus sees itself as a candidate for a permanent position on the un 's exclusive top body .
schröder said france , russia and japan , among others supported such a move and that the united states was sure to do so as well in light of germany 's efforts in the fight against international terrorism .
only the britain , china , france , russia and the united states have permanent seats on the security council , while ten seats rotate every two years between the remaining un members .
germany has held a temporary seat since 2003 . more briefs 19.03.2004 -pipe- court evicts woman for wearing headscarf 19.03.2004 -pipe- bavaria pays off angry lederhosen fans 18.03.2004 -pipe- muslim body criticizes growing discrimination 18.03.2004 -pipe- liberals reject new anti-terror law 18.03.2004 -pipe- minister blames industry for emissions dispute 17.03.2004 -pipe- clement puts brakes on emissions compromise 17.03.2004 -pipe- german conservatives in disarray over köhler nomination 17.03.2004 -pipe- " florida rolf " to draw pension instead of dole radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years . it might be too soon to speak of a comeback , but as representatives from technology companies all over the world descend on hanover for cebit , there 's a sense that just maybe , the worst is over . the high-tech industry suffered three rough years after the technology stock bubble burst .
that 's reflected in the figures for the world 's largest tech trade fair .
in 2001 , cebit attendance peaked with 8,100 exhibitors .
last year , that number was down to around 6,600 .
and while organizers expect 200 fewer exhibitors this year , they say that 's no reason to panic .
some of the decrease is due to the sluggish german economy , as the number of foreign firms attending has increased from last year . growth ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of consumers and industry representatives check out the latest it and computer trends each year at cebit .
the mood should be buoyant during the fair , which runs from march 18 - 24 . industry analysts say tech companies can look forward to a year of slow but steady growth .
" it would be nonsense to assume it 's back to double digit growth , " said charles homs , a senior analyst with the amsterdam-based research firm forrester .
" it 's not a high growth market anymore . "
in particular , he predicts that firms selling a range of products from servers and routers to mobile phones can be pleased with the prospects of the year ahead . forrester anticipates a 2.6 percent rise in overall spending on information and communication technology in four major european markets this year : germany , france , the uk , and the netherlands .
that compares with a mere 0.8 percent growth last year across the hardware , software , services and telecommunications sectors . consumer products a draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags flutter outside the cebit 2004 .
cebit itself has undergone an image-change in recent years .
traditionally , the fair has been a showcase for industry insiders .
but while most of the exhibitors still display products and services directed at corporate clients , the fair has developed a sexier side with emergence of the private consumer market - more pc 's and technical gadgets in the home , and an insatiable interest in mobile phones . accordingly , two of the hot topics at this year 's cebit are the coming start of umts or third generation mobile phone services - set to accelerate following several years of delay - and advances in convergence as computer technology and home entertainment system components become more intertwined . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de slight growth forecast for germany 's it sector despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving .

cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years . it might be too soon to speak of a comeback , but as representatives from technology companies all over the world descend on hanover for cebit , there 's a sense that just maybe , the worst is over . the high-tech industry suffered three rough years after the technology stock bubble burst .
that 's reflected in the figures for the world 's largest tech trade fair .
in 2001 , cebit attendance peaked with 8,100 exhibitors .
last year , that number was down to around 6,600 .

cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years . it might be too soon to speak of a comeback , but as representatives from technology companies all over the world descend on hanover for cebit , there 's a sense that just maybe , the worst is over . the high-tech industry suffered three rough years after the technology stock bubble burst .

after dismal performances in recent years at the eurovision song contest , germany 's steering clear of its kitsch pop crooners this year and instead teaming up with music channel viva to find a cooler act . eurovision , the popular annual europe-wide music event , has become something of a national embarrassment for germany in recent years .
not only has the country come away empty handed from the competition for the past 22 years , but the quality of its kitschy pop-singing candidates too has been in steady decline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lou hoffner last year marked an all-time low with shock-haired , botox-injected lou hoffner -lrb- photo -rrb- coming in an agonizing 13th at the finals in latvia with her clap-your-hands ditty " let 's get happy " penned by none other than german veteran producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german eurovision candidates since 1976 - with only one lucky hit -rrb- . thumbs down for " schlagermusik " but things will be different , and many hope better , this year . as the contest to shortlist a german entry for this year 's eurovision in istanbul looms , the country 's competition organizers have decided to depart from decades of german " schlagermusik , " the sentimental , hand-swaying music often produced by siegel and often performed one-time eurovision crooner michelle , and bring in some new blood instead . in a first , public broadcaster ard has joined forces with the music television channel viva to search for slick young acts to fight it out at the preliminaries , which will be broadcast live on friday . eurovision organizer jürgen meier-beer has stressed that the german eurovision bid needed an image makeover . " we have to win back young spectators who we lost in the last preliminary contest .
after all , it 's the younger generation that determines international music trends , " he said . embracing a market-friendly policy the tie-up with viva has also changed the way germany sends candidates to its eurovision selection round . where once closed-door juries in the all-powerful music industry sent their favorites to the preliminaries , now it 's young music fans themselves who decide through their cd purchases which groups get to the selection . the idea is that record labels send videos of their artists to viva .
the channel then broadcasts the clips on a special weekly tv program called " euroclash , " giving the artists exposure . those who make it highest on the german charts go to the preliminaries . the new market-friendly concept has already ensured that " schlagermusik " fare is out of the running .
instead the finalist group features prominent artists and runs the gamut from techno , house , soul and electro pop . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german rapper sabrina setlur techno group scooter , berlin-based electropunk band mia , mannheim-born half-iraqi pop singer laith al-deen , rapper sabrina setlur -lrb- photo -rrb- , house and techno dj westbam and afrika islam with his trademark techno à la hip hop style are among the 12 acts that will fight it out for a chance to represent germany in istanbul in may . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wins eurovision song contest turkey took top honors at this year ’ s eurovision song contest for the first time , beating out a folk-inspired act from belgium and the controversial russian girl group tatu .

german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a new internet platform for music by downloading the first song on thursday .
the german music industry hopes " phonoline " can help reverse its sagging fortunes . internet file swapping sites like kazaa and gnutella have become the archfiends of the music industry , blamed for the plummeting sales of pre-recorded cds and said to be driving a global business sector close to collapse .
now the industry in germany is fighting back , or at least offering an alternative to people who want to get their music digitally .
downloading kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german chancellor launched " phonoline " at the cebit computer trade fair in hanover .
phonoline is the german answer to itunes , the successful american pay-per-download site run by apple computer . it offers browsers 250,000 songs from a spectrum of different genres for download .
its operators say they hope to expand the catalog eventually to some 700,000 songs and say all the big industry labels , from universal music to bmg to sony , warner and emi , will have their artists represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britney spears madonna and christina aguilera the cost of a song ranges between € 1.19 to € 1.99 -lrb- $ 1.49 to $ 2.50 -rrb- , more expensive than the itunes price , 99 cents a song .
" the -lsb- phonoline -rsb- download is still more attractive than buying a whole cd , " klaus-peter schulenberg , head of cts eventim , one of phonoline 's partners , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
if the computer user wants the whole cd , he said the service will offer song package deals running between € 9.99 and € 16.99 -lrb- $ 12.50 and $ 21.25 -rrb- .
repeated delays phonoline was presented with great fanfare at last year 's popkomm music trade fair in cologne .
it was touted as a way to bring downloading lawbreakers back into the fold of legality and clip the wings of sites like kazaa .
then , there was much talk of phonoline being the first german site to offer a comprehensive platform including the music from both major and independent labels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popkomm the launch date was initially set for shortly after popkomm closed it doors last summer .
but months passed and the service remained offline .
a new date set for fall also came and went , since it had n't been decided who would be responsible for the technical side of the site .
phonoline missed the crucial christmas season as more details were ironed out .
" now there wo n't be any more delays , " said schulenberg . he hopes , despite the late start , to sell some five million songs online this year .
he admits it 's an ambitious goal .
an industry in trouble that kind of optimism , however , is needed in the german music industry , which had one its worst years ever in 2003 , with sales down 20 percent from the year before .
the ratio of bought cds to those burned on home computers flip-flopped in just two years ' time .
in 2000 , 191 million pre-recorded cds were bought in germany , 133 million were burned by consumers .
by 2002 , the number of pre-recorded cd sales had sunk to 166 million and the number of burned cds had exploded to 259 million - a jump of 94 percent .
worldwide the numbers are similar .
global sales of cds , cassettes and records in 1993 amounted to $ 31.2 billion .
after climbing to a high of $ 39.8 billion in 1996 , the numbers began to plummet in 1999 .
by 2002 , worldwide sales stood at $ 32 billion , just above the 1993 figure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buying cds a study by the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that last year some six million internet surfers swapped more than eight billion songs on file swap sites like kazaa .
but industry officials say they may have turned a corner , and say sites like phonoline play an important role in their survival strategy .
according to them , 66 percent of consumers around the world know that unauthorized file-swapping is illegal .
the music catalog available to those who want to download their music legally is expanding ; it grew 30 percent in the last three months of 2003 .
ifpi says the demand for pay-per-download sites rose sharply last year .
competition from itunes in the u.s. , consumers have had the ability to pay for their music downloads for a year now .
according to apple computer , its " itunes music store " offers 30 million songs .
the company plans on bringing its successful model to europe and rumors have it that apple could be planning a launch date as soon as this spring .
if it does launch soon , and keeps its songs priced at 99 cents a piece , it could prove stiff competition to phonoline . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new copyright law gets tough on music pirates computer addicts nonchalantly offering and downloading music and films on the internet in germany now face legal crackdown as the country ’ s new copyright law comes into effect this weekend .

german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a new internet platform for music by downloading the first song on thursday .
the german music industry hopes " phonoline " can help reverse its sagging fortunes . internet file swapping sites like kazaa and gnutella have become the archfiends of the music industry , blamed for the plummeting sales of pre-recorded cds and said to be driving a global business sector close to collapse .
now the industry in germany is fighting back , or at least offering an alternative to people who want to get their music digitally .
downloading kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german chancellor launched " phonoline " at the cebit computer trade fair in hanover .
phonoline is the german answer to itunes , the successful american pay-per-download site run by apple computer . it offers browsers 250,000 songs from a spectrum of different genres for download .
its operators say they hope to expand the catalog eventually to some 700,000 songs and say all the big industry labels , from universal music to bmg to sony , warner and emi , will have their artists represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britney spears madonna and christina aguilera the cost of a song ranges between € 1.19 to € 1.99 -lrb- $ 1.49 to $ 2.50 -rrb- , more expensive than the itunes price , 99 cents a song .
" the -lsb- phonoline -rsb- download is still more attractive than buying a whole cd , " klaus-peter schulenberg , head of cts eventim , one of phonoline 's partners , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
if the computer user wants the whole cd , he said the service will offer song package deals running between € 9.99 and € 16.99 -lrb- $ 12.50 and $ 21.25 -rrb- .
repeated delays phonoline was presented with great fanfare at last year 's popkomm music trade fair in cologne .
it was touted as a way to bring downloading lawbreakers back into the fold of legality and clip the wings of sites like kazaa .
then , there was much talk of phonoline being the first german site to offer a comprehensive platform including the music from both major and independent labels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popkomm the launch date was initially set for shortly after popkomm closed it doors last summer .
but months passed and the service remained offline .
a new date set for fall also came and went , since it had n't been decided who would be responsible for the technical side of the site .
phonoline missed the crucial christmas season as more details were ironed out .
" now there wo n't be any more delays , " said schulenberg . he hopes , despite the late start , to sell some five million songs online this year .
he admits it 's an ambitious goal .
an industry in trouble that kind of optimism , however , is needed in the german music industry , which had one its worst years ever in 2003 , with sales down 20 percent from the year before .
the ratio of bought cds to those burned on home computers flip-flopped in just two years ' time .
in 2000 , 191 million pre-recorded cds were bought in germany , 133 million were burned by consumers .
by 2002 , the number of pre-recorded cd sales had sunk to 166 million and the number of burned cds had exploded to 259 million - a jump of 94 percent .
worldwide the numbers are similar .
global sales of cds , cassettes and records in 1993 amounted to $ 31.2 billion .
after climbing to a high of $ 39.8 billion in 1996 , the numbers began to plummet in 1999 .
by 2002 , worldwide sales stood at $ 32 billion , just above the 1993 figure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buying cds a study by the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that last year some six million internet surfers swapped more than eight billion songs on file swap sites like kazaa .
but industry officials say they may have turned a corner , and say sites like phonoline play an important role in their survival strategy .
according to them , 66 percent of consumers around the world know that unauthorized file-swapping is illegal .
the music catalog available to those who want to download their music legally is expanding ; it grew 30 percent in the last three months of 2003 .
ifpi says the demand for pay-per-download sites rose sharply last year .
competition from itunes in the u.s. , consumers have had the ability to pay for their music downloads for a year now .
according to apple computer , its " itunes music store " offers 30 million songs .
the company plans on bringing its successful model to europe and rumors have it that apple could be planning a launch date as soon as this spring .
if it does launch soon , and keeps its songs priced at 99 cents a piece , it could prove stiff competition to phonoline . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new copyright law gets tough on music pirates computer addicts nonchalantly offering and downloading music and films on the internet in germany now face legal crackdown as the country ’ s new copyright law comes into effect this weekend .

a literary-stimulating diversion has arrived for german smokers weary of staring at death warnings on their cigarette packs -a thin cardboard jacket inscribed with a brief story .
hail the advent of the " cigarette novel . " so you 've bought your pack of marlboro at the corner shop , lit up , and you 're now waiting for the bus .
it 's late , you 're impatient and bored .
you ca n't read the paper tucked under your arm because your hands are full .
and you 're read the billboards around a million times .
your eyes invariably stray to the " smoking leads to impotence " warning blazing on your marlboro pack .
you hastily avert them and instead take another drag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarette warnings in germany the next time you 're in a situation like that , you might consider shelling out an extra € 2 and buying a thin cardboard cover inscribed with , yes , a whole story !
ten lines on the front and another ten on the back . slip that on your pack and voila , there 's entertainment for you .
you can immerse yourself in a quick good fictitious read by popular german writers like russian-born wladimir kaminer and doris dörrie as you take a leisurely smoke and wait for the tube . the brainchild of munich-based publishing house blumenbar , the so-called " cigarette novel " introduced this month promises to deal with the inexhaustible grand themes of literature like love and death .
for instance famous german columnist and author maxim biller 's episode called " melody " opens with the dramatically sweeping statement , " when thomas and melody fell in love , eva had been dead for just two months . " the publishers are talking of breaking ground with a whole new untapped literary genre and are hoping that the compact pocket-sized stories might eventually becoming collectors ' items and take place of pride on bookshelves . but for most german smokers , the idea is more likely to come in handy for camouflaging those nasty " smokers die earlier " and " smoking causes fatal lung cancer " signs issued by the health ministry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2004 poland rekindles hopes of eu constitution deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all is not lost yet .
taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved . just three months after the disastrous breakdown of eu constitution talks in brussels , hope is stirring among member states that the treaty might yet see the light of the day . on friday , poland indicated that it was willing to compromise and that warsaw would no longer stand in the way of a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski in an interview with german business daily financial times deutschland , polish president alexander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he found the new weighting of the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency " an important and interesting idea " and one that " should be reflected over . " kwasniewski said that " before the brussels summit -lrb- last december -rrb- , there was no room for compromise " and added " but now there 's a new situation . " while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .

both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .

polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .

" '
a literary-stimulating diversion has arrived for german smokers weary of staring at death warnings on their cigarette packs -a thin cardboard jacket inscribed with a brief story .
hail the advent of the " cigarette novel . " so you 've bought your pack of marlboro at the corner shop , lit up , and you 're now waiting for the bus .
it 's late , you 're impatient and bored .
you ca n't read the paper tucked under your arm because your hands are full .
and you 're read the billboards around a million times .
your eyes invariably stray to the " smoking leads to impotence " warning blazing on your marlboro pack .
you hastily avert them and instead take another drag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarette warnings in germany the next time you 're in a situation like that , you might consider shelling out an extra € 2 and buying a thin cardboard cover inscribed with , yes , a whole story !
ten lines on the front and another ten on the back . slip that on your pack and voila , there 's entertainment for you .
you can immerse yourself in a quick good fictitious read by popular german writers like russian-born wladimir kaminer and doris dörrie as you take a leisurely smoke and wait for the tube . the brainchild of munich-based publishing house blumenbar , the so-called " cigarette novel " introduced this month promises to deal with the inexhaustible grand themes of literature like love and death .
for instance famous german columnist and author maxim biller 's episode called " melody " opens with the dramatically sweeping statement , " when thomas and melody fell in love , eva had been dead for just two months . " the publishers are talking of breaking ground with a whole new untapped literary genre and are hoping that the compact pocket-sized stories might eventually becoming collectors ' items and take place of pride on bookshelves . but for most german smokers , the idea is more likely to come in handy for camouflaging those nasty " smokers die earlier " and " smoking causes fatal lung cancer " signs issued by the health ministry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the united states gave the files to germany in july 2003 after years of wrangling and over a decade after the fall of the berlin wall .
since then the stasi archive has been assessing and cataloguing the thousands of secret documents .
the head of the archive , marianne birthler said she expected the files to provide few surprising revelations .
it remains unclear how the cia got its hands on the rosewood files . dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies the cia recently handed over sensitive files that name thousands of former east german secret service agents to germany .
the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies .

increasing cooperation the ministers may call for establishment of an eu coordinator for counter-terrorism , who would be responsible for bringing together security measures taken in transport , justice , foreign affairs and finance in the member states . the action plan drafted by eu justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino suggests increasing cooperation and the exchange of information between national intelligence agencies , police and public prosecutors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol logo but several states are likely to resist austria and belgium 's call for the creation of a european central intelligence agency .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac have already dismissed the suggestion .
instead , the ministers will probably decide to strengthen europol , the european law enforcement organization . vitorino 's list of measures includes freezing terrorists ' bank accounts and establishing a pan-eu database of terrorists ' criminal records .
the ministers are also likely to issue a declaration of solidarity with spain .
sluggish tempo eu interior ministers ' convened for an emergency meeting in the aftermath of the sept .

several countries are also dragging their feet when it comes to adopting eu minimum and maximum sentences for terrorists and a common definition of terrorism .
and 11 of the 15 eu members have not yet passed laws to allow police to make cross-border requests to eavesdrop on communications and monitor bank accounts . it 's also questionable whether the meeting will actually result in changes on the ground .
intelligence agencies are notoriously secretive and reluctant to cooperate with each other . spanish interior minister angel acebes is set to brief his eu counterparts on friday on the ongoing investigation into the madrid bombings .
the spanish authorities have been accused of withholding or even providing misleading information to the german intelligence agency bka suggesting that the basque separatist organization eta was responsible for the attacks .

taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved . just three months after the disastrous breakdown of eu constitution talks in brussels , hope is stirring among member states that the treaty might yet see the light of the day . on friday , poland indicated that it was willing to compromise and that warsaw would no longer stand in the way of a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski in an interview with german business daily financial times deutschland , polish president alexander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he found the new weighting of the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency " an important and interesting idea " and one that " should be reflected over . " kwasniewski said that " before the brussels summit -lrb- last december -rrb- , there was no room for compromise " and added " but now there 's a new situation . " while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .
" i think we can reach an agreement which will maintain the balance of power for an enlarged europe , " he said . moving away from entrenched stance the constitution , drafted by the convention chaired by the former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , is designed to give the eu a new president and foreign minister , streamline decision-making in a union of 25 members and attempt to make the eu more democratically accountable and transparent .
both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .
fears of isolation in warsaw there were further signs this week that poland , which joins the eu in may , is serious about reaching a deal on the constitution and wary of being isolated in its refusal to accept plans to change the voting system .
josef oleksy , poland 's deputy prime minister said , " i think the starting point should be an acceptance of the principle of a double majority . "
polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .
" for an individual loneliness is a very unpleasant mental state , " miller said .
" for a country it would be very dangerous . "
miller added he would suggest to bertie ahern , the irish holder of the rotating eu presidency , that talks on the constitution should be renewed at next week 's summit in brussels . compromise could repair frayed eu ties the change of stance in madrid and warsaw is not just expected to be welcomed by brussels , but also help repair relations between eu members , which soured as a result of the iraq war .
both poland and spain supported the u.s. in iraq much to the displeasure of germany and france , both of whom staunchly opposed the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder incoming spanish premier zapatero promised " close and trusty " cooperation with france and germany during a telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- .
even polish president kwasniewski said that a planned visit by schröder to poland next week was " likely to be decisive for a relaunching of negotiations -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- . "
though it 's clear it will be impossible to reach a final deal before may 1 when the eu expands to take in ten new mainly former communist eastern european states , the widespread view is that ireland stands a better chance of forging an agreement than the dutch , who take over the presidency at the end of june .
irish officials say they are " hopeful " of a positive outcome . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape dw-world 's special on the eu constitution debate .

the five men detained on suspicion of involvement in the madrid bombings appeared in court on friday and were accused of terrorist crimes .
meanwhile , the investigation swept far and wide with arrests made across europe . the five men arrested in connection with the madrid bombings appeared in the spanish capital 's high court on friday where they were accused of terrorist crimes .
the three moroccans and two indians repeatedly denied any involvement with al qaeda throughout the seven-hour hearing which took place overnight and ended at 4 a.m.
-lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- on friday morning . the suspects all maintain that they were asleep at home when bombs exploded on four packed commuter trains in madrid on march 11 , killing 202 people and injuring some 1,816 others .
the attacks were the bloodiest since the bali bombings in 2002 which killed a similar number of people when a series of car bombs went off in the crowded tourist areas on the indonesian island . suspects deny links to al qaeda " the five detainees have denied any involvement ...
they have all said that when the attack took place on march 11 they were sleeping in their respective homes , " a court source said .
" they say they do n't have any link with al qaeda or any terrorist organization . " the moroccans - jamal zougam , his brother mohamed chaoui and mohamed bekkali - were accused of 190 murders and belonging to a terrorist group .
the counts of murder attributed to the group are thought to come from the number of identified victims at this time .
that figure could increase in the coming days .
they were also accused of 1,400 attempted murders , a figure which approaches the number of wounded , four " terrorist acts " , presumably one for each train bombed , and stealing a vehicle . zougam , considered to be one of the main suspects in the bombings , wept in court before being returned to his cell where he reportedly prayed . the indians , suresh kumar and vinay khohy , were accused of cooperating with a terrorist group and forging documents .
the court ordered that all five would be held in custody and were taken to soto de real jail , just north of madrid where it is believed they were being held in solitary confinement . formal charges to follow initial hearing under the spanish legal system , the accusations leveled at the suspects points to the fact that the court considers there is a case to answer , providing grounds to keep them in custody .
a decision on formal charges will be taken at a later date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boy walks past the nuevo siglo telephone calling center in madrid .
the three moroccans were all arrested in a telephone shop run by zougam in madrid .
the men were detained after investigators followed up leads associated with the discovery of a stolen mobile phone in a bag along with a bomb that failed to go off on the morning of the bombings . raids on moroccan group across europe meanwhile , the investigation into the bombings continues .
four north africans and a spaniard were arrested in spain on thursday and are expected to appear in court next week .
the spaniard , captured near oviedo in northern spain , is suspected of stealing the locally-made explosives used . elsewhere investigators are pursuing possible links between the madrid attack and the may 2003 suicide bombings in casablanca , morocco , that killed 45 people .
in belgium on friday , anti-terrorist police arrested a suspect wanted in connection with the casablanca bombings after raids across the country . the police raided 20 properties in cities across belgium , including brussels and antwerp , as part of an investigation into north african individuals who had undergone paramilitary training in camps in afghanistan , according to a police statement . casablanca link under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four explosions tore through casablanca killing 20 people .
" one of the people arrested is the subject of an international alert by moroccan authorities following the attack in casablanca on may 15 , 2003 , " the statement read , adding that police had also seized suspicious documents . the investigation into the militant organization , the moroccan islamic combat group -lrb- gmic -rrb- had been stepped up in the wake of the madrid bombings when the identity of some of those detained in connection with the attacks caused alarm .
jamal zougam reportedly left morocco three weeks after the casablanca suicide attacks .
morocco has investigators in spain helping in the madrid investigation , according to officials in rabat , suggesting that links with the gmic were being taken very seriously . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda terror comes to europe ?

" '
a literary-stimulating diversion has arrived for german smokers weary of staring at death warnings on their cigarette packs -a thin cardboard jacket inscribed with a brief story .
hail the advent of the " cigarette novel . " so you 've bought your pack of marlboro at the corner shop , lit up , and you 're now waiting for the bus .
it 's late , you 're impatient and bored .
you ca n't read the paper tucked under your arm because your hands are full .
and you 're read the billboards around a million times .
your eyes invariably stray to the " smoking leads to impotence " warning blazing on your marlboro pack .
you hastily avert them and instead take another drag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarette warnings in germany the next time you 're in a situation like that , you might consider shelling out an extra € 2 and buying a thin cardboard cover inscribed with , yes , a whole story !
ten lines on the front and another ten on the back . slip that on your pack and voila , there 's entertainment for you .
you can immerse yourself in a quick good fictitious read by popular german writers like russian-born wladimir kaminer and doris dörrie as you take a leisurely smoke and wait for the tube . the brainchild of munich-based publishing house blumenbar , the so-called " cigarette novel " introduced this month promises to deal with the inexhaustible grand themes of literature like love and death .
for instance famous german columnist and author maxim biller 's episode called " melody " opens with the dramatically sweeping statement , " when thomas and melody fell in love , eva had been dead for just two months . " the publishers are talking of breaking ground with a whole new untapped literary genre and are hoping that the compact pocket-sized stories might eventually becoming collectors ' items and take place of pride on bookshelves . but for most german smokers , the idea is more likely to come in handy for camouflaging those nasty " smokers die earlier " and " smoking causes fatal lung cancer " signs issued by the health ministry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

that 's reflected in the figures for the world 's largest tech trade fair .
in 2001 , cebit attendance peaked with 8,100 exhibitors .
last year , that number was down to around 6,600 .

" it would be nonsense to assume it 's back to double digit growth , " said charles homs , a senior analyst with the amsterdam-based research firm forrester .
" it 's not a high growth market anymore . "
in particular , he predicts that firms selling a range of products from servers and routers to mobile phones can be pleased with the prospects of the year ahead . forrester anticipates a 2.6 percent rise in overall spending on information and communication technology in four major european markets this year : germany , france , the uk , and the netherlands .

cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years . it might be too soon to speak of a comeback , but as representatives from technology companies all over the world descend on hanover for cebit , there 's a sense that just maybe , the worst is over . the high-tech industry suffered three rough years after the technology stock bubble burst .
that 's reflected in the figures for the world 's largest tech trade fair .
in 2001 , cebit attendance peaked with 8,100 exhibitors .
last year , that number was down to around 6,600 .
and while organizers expect 200 fewer exhibitors this year , they say that 's no reason to panic .
some of the decrease is due to the sluggish german economy , as the number of foreign firms attending has increased from last year . growth ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of consumers and industry representatives check out the latest it and computer trends each year at cebit .
the mood should be buoyant during the fair , which runs from march 18 - 24 . industry analysts say tech companies can look forward to a year of slow but steady growth .
" it would be nonsense to assume it 's back to double digit growth , " said charles homs , a senior analyst with the amsterdam-based research firm forrester .
" it 's not a high growth market anymore . "
in particular , he predicts that firms selling a range of products from servers and routers to mobile phones can be pleased with the prospects of the year ahead . forrester anticipates a 2.6 percent rise in overall spending on information and communication technology in four major european markets this year : germany , france , the uk , and the netherlands .
that compares with a mere 0.8 percent growth last year across the hardware , software , services and telecommunications sectors . consumer products a draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags flutter outside the cebit 2004 .
cebit itself has undergone an image-change in recent years .
traditionally , the fair has been a showcase for industry insiders .

german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a new internet platform for music by downloading the first song on thursday .
the german music industry hopes " phonoline " can help reverse its sagging fortunes . internet file swapping sites like kazaa and gnutella have become the archfiends of the music industry , blamed for the plummeting sales of pre-recorded cds and said to be driving a global business sector close to collapse .
now the industry in germany is fighting back , or at least offering an alternative to people who want to get their music digitally .
downloading kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german chancellor launched " phonoline " at the cebit computer trade fair in hanover .
phonoline is the german answer to itunes , the successful american pay-per-download site run by apple computer . it offers browsers 250,000 songs from a spectrum of different genres for download .
its operators say they hope to expand the catalog eventually to some 700,000 songs and say all the big industry labels , from universal music to bmg to sony , warner and emi , will have their artists represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britney spears madonna and christina aguilera the cost of a song ranges between € 1.19 to € 1.99 -lrb- $ 1.49 to $ 2.50 -rrb- , more expensive than the itunes price , 99 cents a song .
" the -lsb- phonoline -rsb- download is still more attractive than buying a whole cd , " klaus-peter schulenberg , head of cts eventim , one of phonoline 's partners , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
if the computer user wants the whole cd , he said the service will offer song package deals running between € 9.99 and € 16.99 -lrb- $ 12.50 and $ 21.25 -rrb- .
repeated delays phonoline was presented with great fanfare at last year 's popkomm music trade fair in cologne .
it was touted as a way to bring downloading lawbreakers back into the fold of legality and clip the wings of sites like kazaa .
then , there was much talk of phonoline being the first german site to offer a comprehensive platform including the music from both major and independent labels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popkomm the launch date was initially set for shortly after popkomm closed it doors last summer .
but months passed and the service remained offline .
a new date set for fall also came and went , since it had n't been decided who would be responsible for the technical side of the site .
phonoline missed the crucial christmas season as more details were ironed out .
" now there wo n't be any more delays , " said schulenberg . he hopes , despite the late start , to sell some five million songs online this year .
he admits it 's an ambitious goal .
an industry in trouble that kind of optimism , however , is needed in the german music industry , which had one its worst years ever in 2003 , with sales down 20 percent from the year before .
the ratio of bought cds to those burned on home computers flip-flopped in just two years ' time .
in 2000 , 191 million pre-recorded cds were bought in germany , 133 million were burned by consumers .
by 2002 , the number of pre-recorded cd sales had sunk to 166 million and the number of burned cds had exploded to 259 million - a jump of 94 percent .
worldwide the numbers are similar .
global sales of cds , cassettes and records in 1993 amounted to $ 31.2 billion .
after climbing to a high of $ 39.8 billion in 1996 , the numbers began to plummet in 1999 .
by 2002 , worldwide sales stood at $ 32 billion , just above the 1993 figure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buying cds a study by the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that last year some six million internet surfers swapped more than eight billion songs on file swap sites like kazaa .
but industry officials say they may have turned a corner , and say sites like phonoline play an important role in their survival strategy .
according to them , 66 percent of consumers around the world know that unauthorized file-swapping is illegal .
the music catalog available to those who want to download their music legally is expanding ; it grew 30 percent in the last three months of 2003 .
ifpi says the demand for pay-per-download sites rose sharply last year .
competition from itunes in the u.s. , consumers have had the ability to pay for their music downloads for a year now .
according to apple computer , its " itunes music store " offers 30 million songs .
the company plans on bringing its successful model to europe and rumors have it that apple could be planning a launch date as soon as this spring .

german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a new internet platform for music by downloading the first song on thursday .
the german music industry hopes " phonoline " can help reverse its sagging fortunes . internet file swapping sites like kazaa and gnutella have become the archfiends of the music industry , blamed for the plummeting sales of pre-recorded cds and said to be driving a global business sector close to collapse .
now the industry in germany is fighting back , or at least offering an alternative to people who want to get their music digitally .
downloading kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german chancellor launched " phonoline " at the cebit computer trade fair in hanover .
phonoline is the german answer to itunes , the successful american pay-per-download site run by apple computer . it offers browsers 250,000 songs from a spectrum of different genres for download .
its operators say they hope to expand the catalog eventually to some 700,000 songs and say all the big industry labels , from universal music to bmg to sony , warner and emi , will have their artists represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britney spears madonna and christina aguilera the cost of a song ranges between € 1.19 to € 1.99 -lrb- $ 1.49 to $ 2.50 -rrb- , more expensive than the itunes price , 99 cents a song .
" the -lsb- phonoline -rsb- download is still more attractive than buying a whole cd , " klaus-peter schulenberg , head of cts eventim , one of phonoline 's partners , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
if the computer user wants the whole cd , he said the service will offer song package deals running between € 9.99 and € 16.99 -lrb- $ 12.50 and $ 21.25 -rrb- .
repeated delays phonoline was presented with great fanfare at last year 's popkomm music trade fair in cologne .
it was touted as a way to bring downloading lawbreakers back into the fold of legality and clip the wings of sites like kazaa .
then , there was much talk of phonoline being the first german site to offer a comprehensive platform including the music from both major and independent labels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popkomm the launch date was initially set for shortly after popkomm closed it doors last summer .
but months passed and the service remained offline .
a new date set for fall also came and went , since it had n't been decided who would be responsible for the technical side of the site .
phonoline missed the crucial christmas season as more details were ironed out .
" now there wo n't be any more delays , " said schulenberg . he hopes , despite the late start , to sell some five million songs online this year .
he admits it 's an ambitious goal .
an industry in trouble that kind of optimism , however , is needed in the german music industry , which had one its worst years ever in 2003 , with sales down 20 percent from the year before .
the ratio of bought cds to those burned on home computers flip-flopped in just two years ' time .
in 2000 , 191 million pre-recorded cds were bought in germany , 133 million were burned by consumers .
by 2002 , the number of pre-recorded cd sales had sunk to 166 million and the number of burned cds had exploded to 259 million - a jump of 94 percent .
worldwide the numbers are similar .
global sales of cds , cassettes and records in 1993 amounted to $ 31.2 billion .
after climbing to a high of $ 39.8 billion in 1996 , the numbers began to plummet in 1999 .
by 2002 , worldwide sales stood at $ 32 billion , just above the 1993 figure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buying cds a study by the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that last year some six million internet surfers swapped more than eight billion songs on file swap sites like kazaa .
but industry officials say they may have turned a corner , and say sites like phonoline play an important role in their survival strategy .
according to them , 66 percent of consumers around the world know that unauthorized file-swapping is illegal .
the music catalog available to those who want to download their music legally is expanding ; it grew 30 percent in the last three months of 2003 .
ifpi says the demand for pay-per-download sites rose sharply last year .
competition from itunes in the u.s. , consumers have had the ability to pay for their music downloads for a year now .
according to apple computer , its " itunes music store " offers 30 million songs .
the company plans on bringing its successful model to europe and rumors have it that apple could be planning a launch date as soon as this spring .
if it does launch soon , and keeps its songs priced at 99 cents a piece , it could prove stiff competition to phonoline . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new copyright law gets tough on music pirates computer addicts nonchalantly offering and downloading music and films on the internet in germany now face legal crackdown as the country ’ s new copyright law comes into effect this weekend .

taking its cue from spain , poland has now signaled it is willing to compromise on deadlocked eu constitution talks , thus raising prospects of the row finally being resolved . just three months after the disastrous breakdown of eu constitution talks in brussels , hope is stirring among member states that the treaty might yet see the light of the day . on friday , poland indicated that it was willing to compromise and that warsaw would no longer stand in the way of a deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski in an interview with german business daily financial times deutschland , polish president alexander kwasniewski -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he found the new weighting of the " double majority " voting system as proposed by the eu 's irish presidency " an important and interesting idea " and one that " should be reflected over . " kwasniewski said that " before the brussels summit -lrb- last december -rrb- , there was no room for compromise " and added " but now there 's a new situation . " while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .
" i think we can reach an agreement which will maintain the balance of power for an enlarged europe , " he said . moving away from entrenched stance the constitution , drafted by the convention chaired by the former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , is designed to give the eu a new president and foreign minister , streamline decision-making in a union of 25 members and attempt to make the eu more democratically accountable and transparent .
both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .
fears of isolation in warsaw there were further signs this week that poland , which joins the eu in may , is serious about reaching a deal on the constitution and wary of being isolated in its refusal to accept plans to change the voting system .
josef oleksy , poland 's deputy prime minister said , " i think the starting point should be an acceptance of the principle of a double majority . "
polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .
" for an individual loneliness is a very unpleasant mental state , " miller said .
" for a country it would be very dangerous . "
miller added he would suggest to bertie ahern , the irish holder of the rotating eu presidency , that talks on the constitution should be renewed at next week 's summit in brussels . compromise could repair frayed eu ties the change of stance in madrid and warsaw is not just expected to be welcomed by brussels , but also help repair relations between eu members , which soured as a result of the iraq war .

even polish president kwasniewski said that a planned visit by schröder to poland next week was " likely to be decisive for a relaunching of negotiations -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- . "
though it 's clear it will be impossible to reach a final deal before may 1 when the eu expands to take in ten new mainly former communist eastern european states , the widespread view is that ireland stands a better chance of forging an agreement than the dutch , who take over the presidency at the end of june .

" while the under the proposed constitution 50 percent of states and 60 percent of the eu 's population would have to agree , an irish proposal would change that to 55 percent in both cases , hence preventing germany , france and britain from being able to block decisions . warsaw swayed by spain 's change of tack the softening of warsaw 's stance on the issue of voting rights , a major sticking point in the constitution debate , is believed to be prompted by a similar change of track in spain after a shock win for the socialists in national elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero incoming spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- said he wants to see an " accelerated " adoption of an eu constitution to " define a new europe " after his socialist 's party upset election victory .
" i think we can reach an agreement which will maintain the balance of power for an enlarged europe , " he said . moving away from entrenched stance the constitution , drafted by the convention chaired by the former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , is designed to give the eu a new president and foreign minister , streamline decision-making in a union of 25 members and attempt to make the eu more democratically accountable and transparent .
both poland and spain vehemently opposed a compromise deal over voting power at last year 's brussels summit , placing them on a collision course with france and germany .
both warsaw and madrid objected to how the proposed new constitution would curtail smaller countries ' voting rights in the eu council of ministers and insisted instead on sticking to the preferential voting weights agreed at the nice summit in 2000 .
under nice , spain and poland would enjoy disproportionately large influence within the bloc with the same voting rights as eu heavyweights such as germany , whose population is twice as large .
now however madrid and warsaw have changed tack and say they are prepared to negotiate a deal based on a simpler " double majority " system .
fears of isolation in warsaw there were further signs this week that poland , which joins the eu in may , is serious about reaching a deal on the constitution and wary of being isolated in its refusal to accept plans to change the voting system .
josef oleksy , poland 's deputy prime minister said , " i think the starting point should be an acceptance of the principle of a double majority . "
polish prime minister leszek miller told journalists in brussels on thursday that he did not want his country isolated after the new socialist government in spain signaled it would no longer fight alongside poland in a battle over eu voting weights .
" for an individual loneliness is a very unpleasant mental state , " miller said .
" for a country it would be very dangerous . "
miller added he would suggest to bertie ahern , the irish holder of the rotating eu presidency , that talks on the constitution should be renewed at next week 's summit in brussels . compromise could repair frayed eu ties the change of stance in madrid and warsaw is not just expected to be welcomed by brussels , but also help repair relations between eu members , which soured as a result of the iraq war .
both poland and spain supported the u.s. in iraq much to the displeasure of germany and france , both of whom staunchly opposed the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder incoming spanish premier zapatero promised " close and trusty " cooperation with france and germany during a telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- .
even polish president kwasniewski said that a planned visit by schröder to poland next week was " likely to be decisive for a relaunching of negotiations -lrb- on the eu constitution -rrb- . "
though it 's clear it will be impossible to reach a final deal before may 1 when the eu expands to take in ten new mainly former communist eastern european states , the widespread view is that ireland stands a better chance of forging an agreement than the dutch , who take over the presidency at the end of june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.03.2004 music downloading goes legit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phonoline will offer up to 700,000 songs for download .
german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a new internet platform for music by downloading the first song on thursday .
the german music industry hopes " phonoline " can help reverse its sagging fortunes . internet file swapping sites like kazaa and gnutella have become the archfiends of the music industry , blamed for the plummeting sales of pre-recorded cds and said to be driving a global business sector close to collapse .
now the industry in germany is fighting back , or at least offering an alternative to people who want to get their music digitally .
downloading kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german chancellor launched " phonoline " at the cebit computer trade fair in hanover .
phonoline is the german answer to itunes , the successful american pay-per-download site run by apple computer . it offers browsers 250,000 songs from a spectrum of different genres for download .
its operators say they hope to expand the catalog eventually to some 700,000 songs and say all the big industry labels , from universal music to bmg to sony , warner and emi , will have their artists represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britney spears madonna and christina aguilera the cost of a song ranges between € 1.19 to € 1.99 -lrb- $ 1.49 to $ 2.50 -rrb- , more expensive than the itunes price , 99 cents a song .
" the -lsb- phonoline -rsb- download is still more attractive than buying a whole cd , " klaus-peter schulenberg , head of cts eventim , one of phonoline 's partners , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
if the computer user wants the whole cd , he said the service will offer song package deals running between € 9.99 and € 16.99 -lrb- $ 12.50 and $ 21.25 -rrb- .
repeated delays phonoline was presented with great fanfare at last year 's popkomm music trade fair in cologne .
it was touted as a way to bring downloading lawbreakers back into the fold of legality and clip the wings of sites like kazaa .
then , there was much talk of phonoline being the first german site to offer a comprehensive platform including the music from both major and independent labels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popkomm the launch date was initially set for shortly after popkomm closed it doors last summer .
but months passed and the service remained offline .
a new date set for fall also came and went , since it had n't been decided who would be responsible for the technical side of the site .
phonoline missed the crucial christmas season as more details were ironed out .
" now there wo n't be any more delays , " said schulenberg . he hopes , despite the late start , to sell some five million songs online this year .
he admits it 's an ambitious goal .
an industry in trouble that kind of optimism , however , is needed in the german music industry , which had one its worst years ever in 2003 , with sales down 20 percent from the year before .
the ratio of bought cds to those burned on home computers flip-flopped in just two years ' time .
in 2000 , 191 million pre-recorded cds were bought in germany , 133 million were burned by consumers .
by 2002 , the number of pre-recorded cd sales had sunk to 166 million and the number of burned cds had exploded to 259 million - a jump of 94 percent .
worldwide the numbers are similar .
global sales of cds , cassettes and records in 1993 amounted to $ 31.2 billion .
after climbing to a high of $ 39.8 billion in 1996 , the numbers began to plummet in 1999 .
by 2002 , worldwide sales stood at $ 32 billion , just above the 1993 figure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buying cds a study by the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- found that last year some six million internet surfers swapped more than eight billion songs on file swap sites like kazaa .
but industry officials say they may have turned a corner , and say sites like phonoline play an important role in their survival strategy .
according to them , 66 percent of consumers around the world know that unauthorized file-swapping is illegal .
the music catalog available to those who want to download their music legally is expanding ; it grew 30 percent in the last three months of 2003 .
ifpi says the demand for pay-per-download sites rose sharply last year .
competition from itunes in the u.s. , consumers have had the ability to pay for their music downloads for a year now .
according to apple computer , its " itunes music store " offers 30 million songs .
the company plans on bringing its successful model to europe and rumors have it that apple could be planning a launch date as soon as this spring .
if it does launch soon , and keeps its songs priced at 99 cents a piece , it could prove stiff competition to phonoline . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new copyright law gets tough on music pirates computer addicts nonchalantly offering and downloading music and films on the internet in germany now face legal crackdown as the country ’ s new copyright law comes into effect this weekend .

cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years . it might be too soon to speak of a comeback , but as representatives from technology companies all over the world descend on hanover for cebit , there 's a sense that just maybe , the worst is over . the high-tech industry suffered three rough years after the technology stock bubble burst .
that 's reflected in the figures for the world 's largest tech trade fair .
in 2001 , cebit attendance peaked with 8,100 exhibitors .
last year , that number was down to around 6,600 .
and while organizers expect 200 fewer exhibitors this year , they say that 's no reason to panic .
some of the decrease is due to the sluggish german economy , as the number of foreign firms attending has increased from last year . growth ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of consumers and industry representatives check out the latest it and computer trends each year at cebit .
the mood should be buoyant during the fair , which runs from march 18 - 24 . industry analysts say tech companies can look forward to a year of slow but steady growth .
" it would be nonsense to assume it 's back to double digit growth , " said charles homs , a senior analyst with the amsterdam-based research firm forrester .
" it 's not a high growth market anymore . "
in particular , he predicts that firms selling a range of products from servers and routers to mobile phones can be pleased with the prospects of the year ahead . forrester anticipates a 2.6 percent rise in overall spending on information and communication technology in four major european markets this year : germany , france , the uk , and the netherlands .
that compares with a mere 0.8 percent growth last year across the hardware , software , services and telecommunications sectors . consumer products a draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags flutter outside the cebit 2004 .
cebit itself has undergone an image-change in recent years .
traditionally , the fair has been a showcase for industry insiders .
but while most of the exhibitors still display products and services directed at corporate clients , the fair has developed a sexier side with emergence of the private consumer market - more pc 's and technical gadgets in the home , and an insatiable interest in mobile phones . accordingly , two of the hot topics at this year 's cebit are the coming start of umts or third generation mobile phone services - set to accelerate following several years of delay - and advances in convergence as computer technology and home entertainment system components become more intertwined . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de slight growth forecast for germany 's it sector despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving .

german chancellor gerhard schröder inaugurated a new internet platform for music by downloading the first song on thursday .
the german music industry hopes " phonoline " can help reverse its sagging fortunes . internet file swapping sites like kazaa and gnutella have become the archfiends of the music industry , blamed for the plummeting sales of pre-recorded cds and said to be driving a global business sector close to collapse .
now the industry in germany is fighting back , or at least offering an alternative to people who want to get their music digitally .
downloading kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german chancellor launched " phonoline " at the cebit computer trade fair in hanover .
phonoline is the german answer to itunes , the successful american pay-per-download site run by apple computer . it offers browsers 250,000 songs from a spectrum of different genres for download .
its operators say they hope to expand the catalog eventually to some 700,000 songs and say all the big industry labels , from universal music to bmg to sony , warner and emi , will have their artists represented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britney spears madonna and christina aguilera the cost of a song ranges between € 1.19 to € 1.99 -lrb- $ 1.49 to $ 2.50 -rrb- , more expensive than the itunes price , 99 cents a song .
" the -lsb- phonoline -rsb- download is still more attractive than buying a whole cd , " klaus-peter schulenberg , head of cts eventim , one of phonoline 's partners , told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
if the computer user wants the whole cd , he said the service will offer song package deals running between € 9.99 and € 16.99 -lrb- $ 12.50 and $ 21.25 -rrb- .
repeated delays phonoline was presented with great fanfare at last year 's popkomm music trade fair in cologne .
it was touted as a way to bring downloading lawbreakers back into the fold of legality and clip the wings of sites like kazaa .

the five men detained on suspicion of involvement in the madrid bombings appeared in court on friday and were accused of terrorist crimes .
meanwhile , the investigation swept far and wide with arrests made across europe . the five men arrested in connection with the madrid bombings appeared in the spanish capital 's high court on friday where they were accused of terrorist crimes .
the three moroccans and two indians repeatedly denied any involvement with al qaeda throughout the seven-hour hearing which took place overnight and ended at 4 a.m.
-lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- on friday morning . the suspects all maintain that they were asleep at home when bombs exploded on four packed commuter trains in madrid on march 11 , killing 202 people and injuring some 1,816 others .
the attacks were the bloodiest since the bali bombings in 2002 which killed a similar number of people when a series of car bombs went off in the crowded tourist areas on the indonesian island . suspects deny links to al qaeda " the five detainees have denied any involvement ...
they have all said that when the attack took place on march 11 they were sleeping in their respective homes , " a court source said .
" they say they do n't have any link with al qaeda or any terrorist organization . " the moroccans - jamal zougam , his brother mohamed chaoui and mohamed bekkali - were accused of 190 murders and belonging to a terrorist group .
the counts of murder attributed to the group are thought to come from the number of identified victims at this time .

the five men detained on suspicion of involvement in the madrid bombings appeared in court on friday and were accused of terrorist crimes .
meanwhile , the investigation swept far and wide with arrests made across europe . the five men arrested in connection with the madrid bombings appeared in the spanish capital 's high court on friday where they were accused of terrorist crimes .
the three moroccans and two indians repeatedly denied any involvement with al qaeda throughout the seven-hour hearing which took place overnight and ended at 4 a.m.
-lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- on friday morning . the suspects all maintain that they were asleep at home when bombs exploded on four packed commuter trains in madrid on march 11 , killing 202 people and injuring some 1,816 others .
the attacks were the bloodiest since the bali bombings in 2002 which killed a similar number of people when a series of car bombs went off in the crowded tourist areas on the indonesian island . suspects deny links to al qaeda " the five detainees have denied any involvement ...
they have all said that when the attack took place on march 11 they were sleeping in their respective homes , " a court source said .
" they say they do n't have any link with al qaeda or any terrorist organization . " the moroccans - jamal zougam , his brother mohamed chaoui and mohamed bekkali - were accused of 190 murders and belonging to a terrorist group .

cebit , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , will be a leaner affair this year , but that is n't stopping industry experts from predicting growth and an end to the downturn of the past three years . it might be too soon to speak of a comeback , but as representatives from technology companies all over the world descend on hanover for cebit , there 's a sense that just maybe , the worst is over . the high-tech industry suffered three rough years after the technology stock bubble burst .

two paris publications look ahead to this weekend 's french regional elections .
and a czech paper notes that some of its countrymen may feature in the athens olympics in biological warfare suits .
too much to expect ?
as kosovo suffers the worst outbreak of violence for five years , the german berliner zeitung argues that the united nations , the european union and nato " have totally failed in the goal of defusing the basic ethnic conflict " .
the new wave of ethnic violence has clearly demonstrated how untenable the numerous protestations by the albanian authorities are that they can independently , without outside assistance , control the situation in the region rossiyskaya gazeta the paper says high unemployment is partly to blame for a revival of " old dreams of a greater serbia , on one side , and of a greater albania , on the other " .
it believes that both sides would like to see the international community gone to enable them to realise their ideals , " including ethnic cleansing " .
" the outbreaks of violence must be dealt with decisively , including , though not exclusively , by the force of arms , " it concludes .
still in germany , die tageszeitung believes an independent kosovo is the only solution .
a clear prospect of independence , it says , would undermine support for kosovo albanian radicals .
" the civil authorities would then find it easier to assert themselves and , in co-operation with the international community , to guarantee the rights of minorities . "
but the russian government daily rossiyskaya gazeta is critical of independence calls .
the bloodshed of civil war is threatening to return not least because the international community has been trying to sit the kosovo conflict out rather than actively resolve it der standard " the new wave of ethnic violence in kosovo , " it says , " has clearly demonstrated how untenable the numerous protestations by the albanian authorities in pristina are that they can independently , without outside assistance , control the situation in the region are , while appealing to the international community to recognise their independence at the earliest opportunity . "
austria 's der standard says ethnic albanians are " deeply frustrated " that a decision about the status of kosovo has been put back until a series of criteria on the return of refugees and a functioning legal and economic system have been met .
" now the bloodshed of civil war is threatening to return , " the paper adds , " not least because the international community has been trying to sit the kosovo conflict out rather than actively resolve it . "
another austrian daily , die presse , wonders whether partition might be the solution .
it says western opposition to such ideas has encouraged " troublemakers " to engage in violence to promote the message that the vision of a multiethnic society is an illusion .
it admits that a partition of kosovo would be a serious setback for the international community 's balkans policy .
" but if belgrade and pristina were to reach agreement on it , " it comments , " then the west must not stand in the way . "
can a multiethnic kosovo ... seriously be envisaged ?
is it ... desirable when it means keeping foreign troops there for so long ?
tribune de geneve france 's le monde says the situation in kosovo " has ... given the impression that everything has to be done all over again , that no lessons have been learnt , and that the international community has been incapable of easing the hatred even to the slightest extent " .
it criticises the international community for having " played a waiting game , hoping for intercommunal tensions to fade - in vain " .
the " political road ahead will remain blocked " , it adds , " until negotiations begin on the final status of the province " .
the swiss tribune de geneve questions the realism of international expectations .
" can a multiethnic kosovo ... seriously be envisaged ?
is it ... desirable when it means keeping foreign troops there for so long ? " it asks .
" the situation , " the paper says , " appears to be not just inextricable , but potentially explosive , with real risks of destabilisation . "
it concludes that " the international community has no choice but to patch up the holes as quickly as possible " .
' two spectres ' with two days to go to the first round of france 's regional elections and the latest opinion poll showing 65 % of voters declaring little or no interest in the event , a commentary in the nouvel observateur magazine fears that turnout may fall below 50 % .
the latest opinion polls not only reflect very little public interest in the elections but also a wish to punish the government 's performance le figaro it sees " two spectres " haunting french politics : voter abstention and the return of the far-right national front .
" everyone knows that low turnouts automatically favour the extremes of the political spectrum , the national front in particular . "
le figaro also warns that a protest vote might benefit the far right .
" the latest opinion polls not only reflect very little public interest in the elections , " the paper notes , " but also a wish to punish the government 's performance . "
with right and left " running neck-and-neck " , it adds , a " protest vote need not necessarily benefit the -lsb- opposition -rsb- socialists " , but might favour " those offering more radical solutions " .
olympics security a commentary in the czech lidove noviny says the country 's military can be proud that nato is considering asking prague to send a specialist army unit to athens this summer to ensure the olympic games are safe from the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .
the paper urges the czech public not to be put off by the cost of the exercise .
the war against terrorism , it warns , " depends on international solidarity , especially among nato members " , whom " the enemy will attempt to divide " .
" no one in the czech republic is against the country being represented by its athletes in athens , " it continues , adding : " a military contribution would also be a way of representing our country and its determination to confront terrorism . "
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

driving demand has been a new package of software that bundles programs such as photoshop and illustrator together .
net income for the quarter topped analysts ' forecasts and more than doubled from a year ago to $ 123m -lrb- £ 67m -rrb- , or 50 cents a share .
sales also surged , jumping to $ 423.3m and prompting adobe to increase its revenue targets for the full year .
digitisation the company is benefiting from the increasing digitisation of documents , images , video and audio both at home and in the office , analysts said .
to meet changes in the marketplace , adobe released its creative suite package that lets companies buy a number of programs rather than have to shell out for each one separately .
the pick up in demand surprised even the company and creative suite accounted for about 15 % of total revenue during the first quarter .
underpinning the new products , meanwhile , is the company 's acrobat software that lets users create and manage documents in the portable data format -lrb- pdf -rrb- .
many large firms , particularly those in the finance and legal sectors , are trying to streamline their operations and are replacing paper with electronic documents .
slow-down adobe 's first quarter is expected to be stronger than its second and analysts are predicting a drop off in sales because of the easter holidays and shorter months .
that should not rein in growth too much , however , with revenue for the full year now forecast to rise to between $ 1.475bn to $ 1.5bn.
that would be an annual growth rate of about 15 % .

just one in every 290 half dozen eggs on sale today has the bacteria , the agency found , compared to one in 100 in a 1995/96 study .
the 2004 survey sampled uk-produced eggs on sale in shops and markets across the country .
it found no difference in levels between free range and other eggs .
" the survey clearly shows that if you buy uk-produced eggs from shops and markets the possibility of any salmonella contamination is very low indeed , " said lydia wilkie , assistant director of science and enforcement , food standards agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- scotland .
vaccination programme " we are obviously delighted levels are significantly lower today than they were in the mid-1990s .
" this demonstrates first rate progress by the egg industry , " she added .
back in 1998 a programme was set up to vaccinate uk laying hens against a common type of salmonella -lrb- salmonella enteritidis -rrb- , leading to a steady decrease in the number of cases of human illness from this type of salmonella .
the number of reported salmonella enteritidis cases is now at its lowest level since the late 1980s .
currently at least 80 % of all laying hens in the uk are vaccinated against salmonella enteritidis .

dr ritchie said : " put simply , we 're pinpointing foods which you can introduce to your diet - or that of your teenage son or daughter - so they can build up cancer protection in later life . "
the database is the result of three years ' work , based on intricate biology , chemistry and maths .
studies in the past have shown that young women who consume relatively high levels -lrb- between 300 and 1500 micrograms per 100g -rrb- of phyto-oestrogens are far less likely to develop aggressive forms of breast cancer when they reach middle age .
protective claims likewise , the compounds , which only exist in plants and vegetables , may also provide young men with protection against prostate cancer .
dr ritchie said : " it appears that they prevent the development of cells in the breast that are likely to become cancerous in later life .
" we have yet to establish the exact mechanism involved , but it seems clear that we are dealing with a very important class of compounds , one which is going to become increasingly important to our diets in coming years . "
dr tim key , of cancer research uk , said there was still work to be done to determine how effective the system is .
he said : " the possibility that high intakes of phyto-oestrogens might reduce the risk for some types of cancer is an interesting hypothesis , but so far the results of studies of this relationship in humans are not consistent , and no protective effect has been established . "

by julian knight bbc news online personal finance reporter property is key to personal wealth the potential for bust in the booming housing market is an ever-present worry for the uk treasury .
two reports it ordered have recently been released , trying to suggest ways of cutting the chances of a painful implosion in property prices .
in fact , the two mammoth reports boil down to few key recommendations .
more affordable homes need to be built , they say , and borrowers ought to be better protected from bank of england interest rate moves .
tackling housing supply and encouraging more long-term fixed rate mortgage deals , it is hoped , could smooth out the peaks and troughs of the housing market , identified by the chancellor as a barrier to successful uk entry into the euro .
what the nimby - " not in my back yard " - lobby is saying is that the 30 % of the population that do n't have their own home should be pushed aside pierre williams , house builders federation but the reports have a long way to go before curbing the housing market - not least because it continues , in some ways at least , to make many britons wealthy .
both reports are going through exhaustive consultation processes and powerful interests are ranged against them .
teeth on edge the first report , by kate barker , recommended that there should be a relaxation of planning rules to allow the building more affordable homes .
that is bound to set middle britain 's teeth on edge .
" such an increase certainly risks consuming huge areas of valued countryside in a country which is already the most built up in europe - spreading urban sprawl and neglecting the huge need and opportunity for urban regeneration , " henry oliver , spokesman for campaign to protect rural england said , on the day the report was published .
the construction industry accuses people who object to new house builds of putting their own interest first .
" seven out of ten households are owner occupied , " pierre williams of house builders federation told bbc news online .
" many people simply do n't want to see more homes being built as it threatens to damage the price growth of their main investment , namely their property .
" what the nimby - " not in my back yard " - lobby is saying is that the 30 % of the population that do n't have their own home should be pushed aside . "
see how the uk housing market measures up at-a-glance painful results even if the reports recommendations ' feed their way through to the housing market , some economists suggest that it is all too little , too late for this generation of homeowners .
" unfortunately , the current house price boom will play itself out as it has done with painful results three times in the last 20 years , " said capital economics ' ed stansfield .
mr stansfield adds that uk house price inflation could eventually move towards the eu average of the low single digits as opposed to the current high teens .
this could end the housing market gravy train - on which many people are relying for retirement prosperity , following the collapse in confidence in uk pensions .
cooling any long term cooling of uk house prices is bound to have a major impact on how wealthy people feel and how much they are prepared to spend .
" too much of people 's wealth is tied up in their home , lower expectations of price growth and people will start to diversify - saving and investing more , " mr stansfield says .
but this could take many years , he believes .
it seems that ms barker recognises that the progress towards a european style housing market may be slow .
if there is little sign of the improvement after three years , she recommended that the office of fair trading review whether the housing market is working for consumers .
but mr williams warns that if the uk housing shortage is n't cured soon then the nation faces dire consequences .
" forget about the north-south divide , " he says .
" instead we will have the property haves and have-nots .
" an ageing property rich population will be relying on a younger workforce to support them who are not properly housed . "

by julian knight bbc news online personal finance reporter property is key to personal wealth the potential for bust in the booming housing market is an ever-present worry for the uk treasury .
two reports it ordered have recently been released , trying to suggest ways of cutting the chances of a painful implosion in property prices .
in fact , the two mammoth reports boil down to few key recommendations .
more affordable homes need to be built , they say , and borrowers ought to be better protected from bank of england interest rate moves .
tackling housing supply and encouraging more long-term fixed rate mortgage deals , it is hoped , could smooth out the peaks and troughs of the housing market , identified by the chancellor as a barrier to successful uk entry into the euro .
what the nimby - " not in my back yard " - lobby is saying is that the 30 % of the population that do n't have their own home should be pushed aside pierre williams , house builders federation but the reports have a long way to go before curbing the housing market - not least because it continues , in some ways at least , to make many britons wealthy .
both reports are going through exhaustive consultation processes and powerful interests are ranged against them .
teeth on edge the first report , by kate barker , recommended that there should be a relaxation of planning rules to allow the building more affordable homes .
that is bound to set middle britain 's teeth on edge .
" such an increase certainly risks consuming huge areas of valued countryside in a country which is already the most built up in europe - spreading urban sprawl and neglecting the huge need and opportunity for urban regeneration , " henry oliver , spokesman for campaign to protect rural england said , on the day the report was published .
the construction industry accuses people who object to new house builds of putting their own interest first .
" seven out of ten households are owner occupied , " pierre williams of house builders federation told bbc news online .
" many people simply do n't want to see more homes being built as it threatens to damage the price growth of their main investment , namely their property .
" what the nimby - " not in my back yard " - lobby is saying is that the 30 % of the population that do n't have their own home should be pushed aside . "
see how the uk housing market measures up at-a-glance painful results even if the reports recommendations ' feed their way through to the housing market , some economists suggest that it is all too little , too late for this generation of homeowners .
" unfortunately , the current house price boom will play itself out as it has done with painful results three times in the last 20 years , " said capital economics ' ed stansfield .
mr stansfield adds that uk house price inflation could eventually move towards the eu average of the low single digits as opposed to the current high teens .
this could end the housing market gravy train - on which many people are relying for retirement prosperity , following the collapse in confidence in uk pensions .
cooling any long term cooling of uk house prices is bound to have a major impact on how wealthy people feel and how much they are prepared to spend .
" too much of people 's wealth is tied up in their home , lower expectations of price growth and people will start to diversify - saving and investing more , " mr stansfield says .
but this could take many years , he believes .
it seems that ms barker recognises that the progress towards a european style housing market may be slow .
if there is little sign of the improvement after three years , she recommended that the office of fair trading review whether the housing market is working for consumers .
but mr williams warns that if the uk housing shortage is n't cured soon then the nation faces dire consequences .
" forget about the north-south divide , " he says .
" instead we will have the property haves and have-nots .
" an ageing property rich population will be relying on a younger workforce to support them who are not properly housed . "

instead , the petite brent east mp 's keenness to listen to the concerns of local people , many of whom do not speak english as a first language , means her constituency surgeries run and run .
they believe their plans to scrap the council tax and replace it with a local income tax will be crucial in their battle to win over voters lib dem spring conference " last friday night i think we had about 40 people in - some of them were n't from my constituency , " she explains , between sips from her milkless earl grey tea .
" the surgery is supposed to be two hours , but it is three or four normally and saturday mornings as well . "
there is no let up over the weekend either and certainly no time for a lie in .
pester power her saturday nights are dominated by party or constituency events .
sunday mornings are for door knocking and the afternoons for catching up with e-mails .
" it does my office 's head in when i write all these letters , " she says , laughing - something she does quite a lot .
now i 'm pushing 30 and there comes a time when everybody 's liver says : ' okay , time to behave like a grown up ' she readily admits there has been little time for a social life since she was swept into the one-time very safe labour seat at a much publicised by-election just six months ago .
" it 's very hard to meet up with friends , " she says .
" i 'm trying to make an effort to routinely book people in , but i have to diarise it with them , because if i do n't , it does n't happen . "
so if i was her mate and called her for a swifty down the pub , what would the reaction be : " not a chance !
love life " my friends are very patient , long suffering and thankfully , very persistent .
they continue to pester me when i say : ' i 'll get back to you on that ' and they do n't get offended when i plead : ' i 'm really sorry but i 'll have to cancel ' , because something has come up .
sarah teather might be young , but she 's no spice girl " i particularly like to see people who are not in the party , not interested in politics .
it keeps me grounded . "
it seems the pace of her lifestyle has also put paid to thoughts of a boyfriend .
" no time , " she says abruptly .
" not currently . "
but does n't she sometimes feel like sneaking off and letting her hair down ?
stress " i would n't go out and get drunk now in public - it 's been a long time since i went out and did that anyway , " she says .
for the first three weeks i was operating out of an old ford fiesta on starting work at westminster " it 's the kind of thing i did when i was a student , but now i 'm pushing 30 and there comes a time when everybody 's liver says : ' okay , time to behave like a grown up ' . "
very wise .
despite the predictably rapturous welcome ms teather received for winning the brent east seat for the liberal democrats , her foray into national politics did not have the most auspicious of starts .
" for the first three weeks i was operating out of an old ford fiesta and a kitchen in west hampstead and storing house of commons paper in the vegetable rack , " she adds with a chuckle .
" i was inundated with letters and queries , but i did n't have an office or any staff .
that was probably the most stressful thing .
" in any other job you get an office and a desk and a computer and an induction book , but here you start with a budget that you ca n't access for three weeks . "
mickey takers she says it was a deliberate decision to have her main office in brent , instead of westminster , because " that 's where i spend most of my time " .
her staff are like her , quite young " and cheeky " .
" they take the piss out of me routinely , " ms teather says giggling .
give me the definition of a politician ' , and they said : ' an old fat bloke ' on speaking to school pupils " they do n't take me too seriously and i do n't take myself too seriously - that 's very important .
" it 's a very young , lively , enthusiastic team , which is really nice .
it 's quite fresh . "
the mp , who when we meet is dressed in a tweed suit with black collar and neat bobbed hair , says she hopes her colleagues , no matter what age , share her concern that young people are turned off by politics .
" i hope that because i 'm young and female , and unfortunately that is unusual , that will encourage other people , " she says .
" i really enjoy going into schools and talking about politics and being slightly different .
" i went into one gcse class and said : ' give me the definition of a politician ' , and they said : ' an old fat bloke ' .
" and i said : " do i look like an mp ? ' and they said , ' no ' , so i said : ' well i am your mp ' , and they were ' wow ' and it 's a shock . "
fluffy jumpers but ms teather , who joined the lib dems while still a student at st john 's college , cambridge , in 1993 , says she does n't go out of her way to " be different " .
" sometimes i come to westminster in a leather skirt and sometimes , i wear a suit .
i wear what i wear .
ms teather was greeted at the commons by her fellow mps " i 'm not trying to carve out a niche - i 'm trying to do my job .
right now i have a thing for fluffy jumpers and suede skirts . "
she finds the house of commons quite a strange place .
" organisationally , everything is a nightmare and takes much longer than you might expect , " she says .
" i find the fact that you do n't clap quite odd .
mps bang desks instead .
" there 's an awful lot to learn and get your head around . "
sleeping she is irritated that the commons " does not in any sense represent the diversity of the uk " and says prime minister 's question time can be " childish - it 's a bit puerile , feels a bit teenage " .
already a junior health spokeswoman , she does have ambitions to serve in a lib dem government .
" there is a tendency sometimes to be happy with opposition , to take the moral high ground , to bash away at everybody else , " she says .
" but if you have a very clear vision about what you want to see achieved , the only real way to do that is to get into government , " she says firmly .
in those rare moments of spare time the former macmillan cancer care relief health policy advisor enjoys " sleeping " and " singing in the parliamentary choir " , which is currently rehearsing brahms ' german requiem .
so what do her parents think of having an mp daughter ?
" they are still recovering from the shock . "
and her brothers matthew , 26 , and andrew , 23 ?
she pauses , and then adds : " they are quite chuffed really . "

they believe their plans to scrap the council tax and replace it with a local income tax will be crucial in their battle to win over voters lib dem spring conference " last friday night i think we had about 40 people in - some of them were n't from my constituency , " she explains , between sips from her milkless earl grey tea .
" the surgery is supposed to be two hours , but it is three or four normally and saturday mornings as well . "
there is no let up over the weekend either and certainly no time for a lie in .
pester power her saturday nights are dominated by party or constituency events .
sunday mornings are for door knocking and the afternoons for catching up with e-mails .
" it does my office 's head in when i write all these letters , " she says , laughing - something she does quite a lot .
now i 'm pushing 30 and there comes a time when everybody 's liver says : ' okay , time to behave like a grown up ' she readily admits there has been little time for a social life since she was swept into the one-time very safe labour seat at a much publicised by-election just six months ago .
" it 's very hard to meet up with friends , " she says .
" i 'm trying to make an effort to routinely book people in , but i have to diarise it with them , because if i do n't , it does n't happen . "
so if i was her mate and called her for a swifty down the pub , what would the reaction be : " not a chance !
love life " my friends are very patient , long suffering and thankfully , very persistent .
they continue to pester me when i say : ' i 'll get back to you on that ' and they do n't get offended when i plead : ' i 'm really sorry but i 'll have to cancel ' , because something has come up .
sarah teather might be young , but she 's no spice girl " i particularly like to see people who are not in the party , not interested in politics .
it keeps me grounded . "
it seems the pace of her lifestyle has also put paid to thoughts of a boyfriend .
" no time , " she says abruptly .
" not currently . "
but does n't she sometimes feel like sneaking off and letting her hair down ?
stress " i would n't go out and get drunk now in public - it 's been a long time since i went out and did that anyway , " she says .
for the first three weeks i was operating out of an old ford fiesta on starting work at westminster " it 's the kind of thing i did when i was a student , but now i 'm pushing 30 and there comes a time when everybody 's liver says : ' okay , time to behave like a grown up ' . "
very wise .
despite the predictably rapturous welcome ms teather received for winning the brent east seat for the liberal democrats , her foray into national politics did not have the most auspicious of starts .
" for the first three weeks i was operating out of an old ford fiesta and a kitchen in west hampstead and storing house of commons paper in the vegetable rack , " she adds with a chuckle .
" i was inundated with letters and queries , but i did n't have an office or any staff .
that was probably the most stressful thing .
" in any other job you get an office and a desk and a computer and an induction book , but here you start with a budget that you ca n't access for three weeks . "
mickey takers she says it was a deliberate decision to have her main office in brent , instead of westminster , because " that 's where i spend most of my time " .
her staff are like her , quite young " and cheeky " .
" they take the piss out of me routinely , " ms teather says giggling .
give me the definition of a politician ' , and they said : ' an old fat bloke ' on speaking to school pupils " they do n't take me too seriously and i do n't take myself too seriously - that 's very important .
" it 's a very young , lively , enthusiastic team , which is really nice .
it 's quite fresh . "
the mp , who when we meet is dressed in a tweed suit with black collar and neat bobbed hair , says she hopes her colleagues , no matter what age , share her concern that young people are turned off by politics .
" i hope that because i 'm young and female , and unfortunately that is unusual , that will encourage other people , " she says .
" i really enjoy going into schools and talking about politics and being slightly different .
" i went into one gcse class and said : ' give me the definition of a politician ' , and they said : ' an old fat bloke ' .
" and i said : " do i look like an mp ? ' and they said , ' no ' , so i said : ' well i am your mp ' , and they were ' wow ' and it 's a shock . "
fluffy jumpers but ms teather , who joined the lib dems while still a student at st john 's college , cambridge , in 1993 , says she does n't go out of her way to " be different " .
" sometimes i come to westminster in a leather skirt and sometimes , i wear a suit .
i wear what i wear .
ms teather was greeted at the commons by her fellow mps " i 'm not trying to carve out a niche - i 'm trying to do my job .
right now i have a thing for fluffy jumpers and suede skirts . "
she finds the house of commons quite a strange place .
" organisationally , everything is a nightmare and takes much longer than you might expect , " she says .
" i find the fact that you do n't clap quite odd .
mps bang desks instead .
" there 's an awful lot to learn and get your head around . "
sleeping she is irritated that the commons " does not in any sense represent the diversity of the uk " and says prime minister 's question time can be " childish - it 's a bit puerile , feels a bit teenage " .
already a junior health spokeswoman , she does have ambitions to serve in a lib dem government .
" there is a tendency sometimes to be happy with opposition , to take the moral high ground , to bash away at everybody else , " she says .
" but if you have a very clear vision about what you want to see achieved , the only real way to do that is to get into government , " she says firmly .
in those rare moments of spare time the former macmillan cancer care relief health policy advisor enjoys " sleeping " and " singing in the parliamentary choir " , which is currently rehearsing brahms ' german requiem .
so what do her parents think of having an mp daughter ?
" they are still recovering from the shock . "
and her brothers matthew , 26 , and andrew , 23 ?
she pauses , and then adds : " they are quite chuffed really . "

lawyers for mr skilling argued that he needed access to the funds to support his family and pay ongoing legal costs .
court papers showed that the 50-year-old executive has already spent $ 23m on fees for his defence team .
mr skilling , who surrendered to the fbi , has been charged with 35 counts of fraud , insider trading and lying about the state of the enron 's finances .
next step the highest ranking executive at the company to be indicted so far , mr skilling has denied all of the charges .
his lawyer , daniel petrocelli , said the defence team were considering what to do following the judge 's ruling .
commenting on the size of the legal fees , mr petrocelli said his client was probably going to have to spend a lot more to clear his name .
corporate america was shocked when enron collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in december 2001 , after it was revealed it had hidden billions of dollars in debt with false accounting .
prosecutors claim that mr skilling and his associates conspired " to cook the books to create the illusion that -lrb- enron -rrb- was a growing , robust company with limitless potential " .
central to their case is enron 's former chief financial officer andrew fastow , who pleaded guilty to two fraud counts in exchange for a 10-year prison sentence .
it is believed that mr fastow and his wife lea - who also worked for enron - cut a deal with prosecutors to reveal what they know about the involvement of other people in the fraud .

corporate america was shocked when enron collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in december 2001 , after it was revealed it had hidden billions of dollars in debt with false accounting .
