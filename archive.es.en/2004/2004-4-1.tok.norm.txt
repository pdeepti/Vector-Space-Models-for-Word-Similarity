" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .
opinion polls have shown that most greek cypriots would say " no " to reunification , and a slim majority of turkish cypriots would vote " yes . " if either referenda fails , only the greek cypriot part of the island , which is internationally recognized , will join the european union on may 1 .
the turkish cypriot north , which is only recognized by ankara , will remain internationally isolated .
turkey will also face a setback to its efforts to join the eu .

greek and turkish cypriots some began crossing from one side to the other of their divided island for the first time since 29-year-old travel restrictions were lifted by the turkish side earlier in the month .
the failed proposals , some details of which were leaked to the press , called for a republic led by a federal state made up of both greek and turkish cypriots .
greek cypriots and returnees would have been restricted from moving to the turkish part of the island and from buying property there .
turkish soldiers would have remained stationed in the north as well . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece in 1974 .
around 160,000 greek cypriots fled from their homes when turkey invaded .
since then thousands of turks have settled on the island .
greek cypriots make up around two-thirds of cyprus ' 800,000 population .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2004 anti-semitism on the rise in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young males with right-wing outlooks are behind many attacks , the report says .
a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits .

" incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators failed wednesday to agree on plans to reunify cyprus .
in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .
" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .
opinion polls have shown that most greek cypriots would say " no " to reunification , and a slim majority of turkish cypriots would vote " yes . " if either referenda fails , only the greek cypriot part of the island , which is internationally recognized , will join the european union on may 1 .
the turkish cypriot north , which is only recognized by ankara , will remain internationally isolated .
turkey will also face a setback to its efforts to join the eu .
ethnically-based federation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots cross the un buffer zone south to the greek cypriot controlled ledra palace checkpoint in april 2003 .
greek and turkish cypriots some began crossing from one side to the other of their divided island for the first time since 29-year-old travel restrictions were lifted by the turkish side earlier in the month .
the failed proposals , some details of which were leaked to the press , called for a republic led by a federal state made up of both greek and turkish cypriots .
greek cypriots and returnees would have been restricted from moving to the turkish part of the island and from buying property there .
turkish soldiers would have remained stationed in the north as well . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece in 1974 .
around 160,000 greek cypriots fled from their homes when turkey invaded .
since then thousands of turks have settled on the island .
greek cypriots make up around two-thirds of cyprus ' 800,000 population .

on the final day of the afghanistan donor conference in berlin , the international community agreed to aid the country in its battle against drugs and committed its troops to work to increase security ahead of elections . coming one day after donor nations offered billions of dollars in financial support for afghanistan , the delegations from 56 countries on thursday pledged to afghan president hamid karzai that his government would not be left alone in its attempts to stabilize the war-torn country . nato members told karzai that troops from the isaf peacekeeping force would stay in afghanistan until the local authorities could ensure security . donor countries pledged a total of $ 8.2 billion in aid over the next three years to afghanistan on the first day of the conference on wednesday .
the country is set to receive $ 4.4 billion of the sum by march 20 , 2005 .
the world bank estimated that afghanistan would need $ 27.5 billion over the next seven years for reconstruction . karzai 's assessment of the two-day conference was a positive one : " i am a very satisfied man today . " stabilization a priority before elections conference participants are also discussing how to stabilize the country , which is still plagued by lawlessness and poor security conditions , particularly in the remote mountainous regions outside the capital of kabul . regional warlords and tribal chiefs control whole areas of afghanistan , pursuing their own interests , which often run counter to those of the central government .
one of the main issues at the conference is providing a safe backdrop for the first free presidential and parliamentary elections in september . the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , currently led by nato and composed of 5,500 troops from numerous countries is charged with ensuring security in kabul and its surroundings .
germany has 2,000 soldiers among the isaf troops , including a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in the north of the country . nato on thursday said it may sent up to five new prts to afghanistan and italy said it would send 300 troops .
germany is also likely send an extra 250 troops to help keep the peace .
berlin is also helping to train afghan police . fighting drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan men walk through a poppy field in the nangharhar province of afghanistan .
conference delegates also said they would step up the battle against production and trafficking of illegal drugs in and around afghanistan . " drugs and warlordism and terrorism reinforce each other , " karzai said .
" for afghanistan to have peace , we have to address all three at the same time . " an anti-drug treaty signed by afghanistan , china , iran , pakistan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan foresees close cooperation in fighting the flourishing drug trade and opium production as well as consumption .
police and intelligence services will work together to create a so-called " security belt , " to cut off drug smugglers ' access to the border . experts from the countries involved will meet in kabul by june to push forward the anti-drug accord , worked out under british auspices .
" a stable afghanistan with a strong central government is essential to counter-narcotics efforts , " the agreement stated . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose country hosted the conference in berlin , said the agreement was an important step and pledged germany 's support in putting it into practice . the accord comes on the heels of karzai 's warning to the conference delegates from 56 countries that the drug trade and opium cultivation " are threatening the very existence of the afghan state . " indeed , 80 percent of the opium poppies - from which heroin is derived - grown worldwide come from afghanistan .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .
that figure falls short of the kabul government 's three-year goal of raising $ 11.9 billion dollars , but eclipse the $ 4.5 billion pledged at the 2002 tokyo donors conference .
a dollar a day afghanistan is one of the world 's poorest countries .
some four million of its 25 million population live on less than 50 u.s. cents a day , ghani said during the conference .

" we 're not asking for the mercedes-benz of development , we 're asking for the basic bicycle of development , " he said .
karzai 's government is seeking roughly $ 28 billion for the next seven years .
it says the money is essential to help rebuild the nation and make it self-sufficient in the near future .
speaking to the delegates at the conference , karzai called for " sustained assistance " from those countries who have stood by afghanistan so far .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .
that figure falls short of the kabul government 's three-year goal of raising $ 11.9 billion dollars , but eclipse the $ 4.5 billion pledged at the 2002 tokyo donors conference .
a dollar a day afghanistan is one of the world 's poorest countries .
some four million of its 25 million population live on less than 50 u.s. cents a day , ghani said during the conference .
" our priority is precisely to ensure a move from abject poverty to poverty with dignity - at least a dollar a day , " he told reporters .
" we 're not asking for the mercedes-benz of development , we 're asking for the basic bicycle of development , " he said .
karzai 's government is seeking roughly $ 28 billion for the next seven years .
it says the money is essential to help rebuild the nation and make it self-sufficient in the near future .
speaking to the delegates at the conference , karzai called for " sustained assistance " from those countries who have stood by afghanistan so far .
" let us see that afghanistan in a few years will not be a burden on your shoulders , but a state that will stand on his own strong feet , " he said .
pledges roll in " the united states will not abandon you , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told karzai as he offered $ 1 billion in aid on top of the $ 1.2 billion washington has already committed for this year .
the european union pledged € 700 million -lrb- $ 852 million -rrb- for this year , with individual countries also offering their assistance .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose country has traditionally provided the largest amount of financial aid in europe , pledged € 320 million over the next four years .
italy offered more than € 140 million over the next three years .
japan offered $ 400 million over the next two years and the asian development bank pledged about $ 1 billion in loans and grants between 2005 and 2008 .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators failed wednesday to agree on plans to reunify cyprus .
in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .
" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .
opinion polls have shown that most greek cypriots would say " no " to reunification , and a slim majority of turkish cypriots would vote " yes . " if either referenda fails , only the greek cypriot part of the island , which is internationally recognized , will join the european union on may 1 .

on the final day of the afghanistan donor conference in berlin , the international community agreed to aid the country in its battle against drugs and committed its troops to work to increase security ahead of elections . coming one day after donor nations offered billions of dollars in financial support for afghanistan , the delegations from 56 countries on thursday pledged to afghan president hamid karzai that his government would not be left alone in its attempts to stabilize the war-torn country . nato members told karzai that troops from the isaf peacekeeping force would stay in afghanistan until the local authorities could ensure security . donor countries pledged a total of $ 8.2 billion in aid over the next three years to afghanistan on the first day of the conference on wednesday .
the country is set to receive $ 4.4 billion of the sum by march 20 , 2005 .
the world bank estimated that afghanistan would need $ 27.5 billion over the next seven years for reconstruction . karzai 's assessment of the two-day conference was a positive one : " i am a very satisfied man today . " stabilization a priority before elections conference participants are also discussing how to stabilize the country , which is still plagued by lawlessness and poor security conditions , particularly in the remote mountainous regions outside the capital of kabul . regional warlords and tribal chiefs control whole areas of afghanistan , pursuing their own interests , which often run counter to those of the central government .
one of the main issues at the conference is providing a safe backdrop for the first free presidential and parliamentary elections in september . the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , currently led by nato and composed of 5,500 troops from numerous countries is charged with ensuring security in kabul and its surroundings .
germany has 2,000 soldiers among the isaf troops , including a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in the north of the country . nato on thursday said it may sent up to five new prts to afghanistan and italy said it would send 300 troops .
germany is also likely send an extra 250 troops to help keep the peace .
berlin is also helping to train afghan police . fighting drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan men walk through a poppy field in the nangharhar province of afghanistan .
conference delegates also said they would step up the battle against production and trafficking of illegal drugs in and around afghanistan . " drugs and warlordism and terrorism reinforce each other , " karzai said .
" for afghanistan to have peace , we have to address all three at the same time . " an anti-drug treaty signed by afghanistan , china , iran , pakistan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan foresees close cooperation in fighting the flourishing drug trade and opium production as well as consumption .
police and intelligence services will work together to create a so-called " security belt , " to cut off drug smugglers ' access to the border . experts from the countries involved will meet in kabul by june to push forward the anti-drug accord , worked out under british auspices .
" a stable afghanistan with a strong central government is essential to counter-narcotics efforts , " the agreement stated . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose country hosted the conference in berlin , said the agreement was an important step and pledged germany 's support in putting it into practice . the accord comes on the heels of karzai 's warning to the conference delegates from 56 countries that the drug trade and opium cultivation " are threatening the very existence of the afghan state .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators failed wednesday to agree on plans to reunify cyprus .
in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .
" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .
opinion polls have shown that most greek cypriots would say " no " to reunification , and a slim majority of turkish cypriots would vote " yes . " if either referenda fails , only the greek cypriot part of the island , which is internationally recognized , will join the european union on may 1 .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators failed wednesday to agree on plans to reunify cyprus .
in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .
" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .
opinion polls have shown that most greek cypriots would say " no " to reunification , and a slim majority of turkish cypriots would vote " yes . " if either referenda fails , only the greek cypriot part of the island , which is internationally recognized , will join the european union on may 1 .
the turkish cypriot north , which is only recognized by ankara , will remain internationally isolated .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

on the final day of the afghanistan donor conference in berlin , the international community agreed to aid the country in its battle against drugs and committed its troops to work to increase security ahead of elections . coming one day after donor nations offered billions of dollars in financial support for afghanistan , the delegations from 56 countries on thursday pledged to afghan president hamid karzai that his government would not be left alone in its attempts to stabilize the war-torn country . nato members told karzai that troops from the isaf peacekeeping force would stay in afghanistan until the local authorities could ensure security . donor countries pledged a total of $ 8.2 billion in aid over the next three years to afghanistan on the first day of the conference on wednesday .
the country is set to receive $ 4.4 billion of the sum by march 20 , 2005 .
the world bank estimated that afghanistan would need $ 27.5 billion over the next seven years for reconstruction . karzai 's assessment of the two-day conference was a positive one : " i am a very satisfied man today . " stabilization a priority before elections conference participants are also discussing how to stabilize the country , which is still plagued by lawlessness and poor security conditions , particularly in the remote mountainous regions outside the capital of kabul . regional warlords and tribal chiefs control whole areas of afghanistan , pursuing their own interests , which often run counter to those of the central government .
one of the main issues at the conference is providing a safe backdrop for the first free presidential and parliamentary elections in september . the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , currently led by nato and composed of 5,500 troops from numerous countries is charged with ensuring security in kabul and its surroundings .
germany has 2,000 soldiers among the isaf troops , including a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in the north of the country . nato on thursday said it may sent up to five new prts to afghanistan and italy said it would send 300 troops .
germany is also likely send an extra 250 troops to help keep the peace .
berlin is also helping to train afghan police . fighting drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan men walk through a poppy field in the nangharhar province of afghanistan .
conference delegates also said they would step up the battle against production and trafficking of illegal drugs in and around afghanistan . " drugs and warlordism and terrorism reinforce each other , " karzai said .
" for afghanistan to have peace , we have to address all three at the same time . " an anti-drug treaty signed by afghanistan , china , iran , pakistan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan foresees close cooperation in fighting the flourishing drug trade and opium production as well as consumption .
police and intelligence services will work together to create a so-called " security belt , " to cut off drug smugglers ' access to the border . experts from the countries involved will meet in kabul by june to push forward the anti-drug accord , worked out under british auspices .
" a stable afghanistan with a strong central government is essential to counter-narcotics efforts , " the agreement stated . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose country hosted the conference in berlin , said the agreement was an important step and pledged germany 's support in putting it into practice . the accord comes on the heels of karzai 's warning to the conference delegates from 56 countries that the drug trade and opium cultivation " are threatening the very existence of the afghan state . " indeed , 80 percent of the opium poppies - from which heroin is derived - grown worldwide come from afghanistan .
along with disarming warlords and militias , the fight against the drug trade remains one of the most daunting challenges facing the country . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghan donor conference pledges $ 8.2 billion in aid germany , the u.s. and other wealthy countries responded to afghan president hamid karzai 's appeal to help his country " stand on its own strong feet " by pledging $ 8.2 billion next year for reconstruction aid .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .
that figure falls short of the kabul government 's three-year goal of raising $ 11.9 billion dollars , but eclipse the $ 4.5 billion pledged at the 2002 tokyo donors conference .

" let us see that afghanistan in a few years will not be a burden on your shoulders , but a state that will stand on his own strong feet , " he said .
pledges roll in " the united states will not abandon you , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told karzai as he offered $ 1 billion in aid on top of the $ 1.2 billion washington has already committed for this year .
the european union pledged € 700 million -lrb- $ 852 million -rrb- for this year , with individual countries also offering their assistance .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose country has traditionally provided the largest amount of financial aid in europe , pledged € 320 million over the next four years .
italy offered more than € 140 million over the next three years .
japan offered $ 400 million over the next two years and the asian development bank pledged about $ 1 billion in loans and grants between 2005 and 2008 .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators failed wednesday to agree on plans to reunify cyprus .
in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .
" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .
opinion polls have shown that most greek cypriots would say " no " to reunification , and a slim majority of turkish cypriots would vote " yes . " if either referenda fails , only the greek cypriot part of the island , which is internationally recognized , will join the european union on may 1 .
the turkish cypriot north , which is only recognized by ankara , will remain internationally isolated .
turkey will also face a setback to its efforts to join the eu .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .
that figure falls short of the kabul government 's three-year goal of raising $ 11.9 billion dollars , but eclipse the $ 4.5 billion pledged at the 2002 tokyo donors conference .
a dollar a day afghanistan is one of the world 's poorest countries .
some four million of its 25 million population live on less than 50 u.s. cents a day , ghani said during the conference .
" our priority is precisely to ensure a move from abject poverty to poverty with dignity - at least a dollar a day , " he told reporters .
" we 're not asking for the mercedes-benz of development , we 're asking for the basic bicycle of development , " he said .
karzai 's government is seeking roughly $ 28 billion for the next seven years .
it says the money is essential to help rebuild the nation and make it self-sufficient in the near future .
speaking to the delegates at the conference , karzai called for " sustained assistance " from those countries who have stood by afghanistan so far .
" let us see that afghanistan in a few years will not be a burden on your shoulders , but a state that will stand on his own strong feet , " he said .
pledges roll in " the united states will not abandon you , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told karzai as he offered $ 1 billion in aid on top of the $ 1.2 billion washington has already committed for this year .
the european union pledged € 700 million -lrb- $ 852 million -rrb- for this year , with individual countries also offering their assistance .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose country has traditionally provided the largest amount of financial aid in europe , pledged € 320 million over the next four years .
italy offered more than € 140 million over the next three years .
japan offered $ 400 million over the next two years and the asian development bank pledged about $ 1 billion in loans and grants between 2005 and 2008 .
in addition , russia and afghanistan are reportedly in negotiation over a debt write-off that would forgive afghanistan 80 percent of the some $ 10 billion it owes moscow and would open the way for russia to give aid to a country it once occupied . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for political stability the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .

court sources said that legal teams for both parties will plead their case orally before judges in a metter that could be settled as early as mid-july .
the case was brought by the european commission in january after finance ministers decided to suspend disciplinary action against france and germany for breaching the rules that underpin the euro .
these rules state that countries in the euro-zone - the 12 member states that use the currency - must not run a budget deficit above 3 percent of gross domestic product over a year .
this deficit ceiling has been repeatedly broken by paris and berlin - the euro-zone 's two biggest economies .
the commission has thus decided to initiate legal action against the two countries that could end in billion-euro fines being levied on france and germany .
meanwhile , in a separate development , one of the main critics of france and germany , the netherlands , announced on wednesday that its budget deficit would also exceed the 3 percent limit .

court sources said that legal teams for both parties will plead their case orally before judges in a metter that could be settled as early as mid-july .
the case was brought by the european commission in january after finance ministers decided to suspend disciplinary action against france and germany for breaching the rules that underpin the euro .
these rules state that countries in the euro-zone - the 12 member states that use the currency - must not run a budget deficit above 3 percent of gross domestic product over a year .
this deficit ceiling has been repeatedly broken by paris and berlin - the euro-zone 's two biggest economies .
the commission has thus decided to initiate legal action against the two countries that could end in billion-euro fines being levied on france and germany .
meanwhile , in a separate development , one of the main critics of france and germany , the netherlands , announced on wednesday that its budget deficit would also exceed the 3 percent limit .

on the final day of the afghanistan donor conference in berlin , the international community agreed to aid the country in its battle against drugs and committed its troops to work to increase security ahead of elections . coming one day after donor nations offered billions of dollars in financial support for afghanistan , the delegations from 56 countries on thursday pledged to afghan president hamid karzai that his government would not be left alone in its attempts to stabilize the war-torn country . nato members told karzai that troops from the isaf peacekeeping force would stay in afghanistan until the local authorities could ensure security . donor countries pledged a total of $ 8.2 billion in aid over the next three years to afghanistan on the first day of the conference on wednesday .
the country is set to receive $ 4.4 billion of the sum by march 20 , 2005 .
the world bank estimated that afghanistan would need $ 27.5 billion over the next seven years for reconstruction . karzai 's assessment of the two-day conference was a positive one : " i am a very satisfied man today . " stabilization a priority before elections conference participants are also discussing how to stabilize the country , which is still plagued by lawlessness and poor security conditions , particularly in the remote mountainous regions outside the capital of kabul . regional warlords and tribal chiefs control whole areas of afghanistan , pursuing their own interests , which often run counter to those of the central government .
one of the main issues at the conference is providing a safe backdrop for the first free presidential and parliamentary elections in september . the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , currently led by nato and composed of 5,500 troops from numerous countries is charged with ensuring security in kabul and its surroundings .
germany has 2,000 soldiers among the isaf troops , including a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in the north of the country . nato on thursday said it may sent up to five new prts to afghanistan and italy said it would send 300 troops .
germany is also likely send an extra 250 troops to help keep the peace .
berlin is also helping to train afghan police . fighting drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan men walk through a poppy field in the nangharhar province of afghanistan .
conference delegates also said they would step up the battle against production and trafficking of illegal drugs in and around afghanistan . " drugs and warlordism and terrorism reinforce each other , " karzai said .
" for afghanistan to have peace , we have to address all three at the same time . " an anti-drug treaty signed by afghanistan , china , iran , pakistan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan foresees close cooperation in fighting the flourishing drug trade and opium production as well as consumption .
police and intelligence services will work together to create a so-called " security belt , " to cut off drug smugglers ' access to the border . experts from the countries involved will meet in kabul by june to push forward the anti-drug accord , worked out under british auspices .
" a stable afghanistan with a strong central government is essential to counter-narcotics efforts , " the agreement stated . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose country hosted the conference in berlin , said the agreement was an important step and pledged germany 's support in putting it into practice . the accord comes on the heels of karzai 's warning to the conference delegates from 56 countries that the drug trade and opium cultivation " are threatening the very existence of the afghan state . " indeed , 80 percent of the opium poppies - from which heroin is derived - grown worldwide come from afghanistan .
along with disarming warlords and militias , the fight against the drug trade remains one of the most daunting challenges facing the country . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghan donor conference pledges $ 8.2 billion in aid germany , the u.s. and other wealthy countries responded to afghan president hamid karzai 's appeal to help his country " stand on its own strong feet " by pledging $ 8.2 billion next year for reconstruction aid .

court sources said that legal teams for both parties will plead their case orally before judges in a metter that could be settled as early as mid-july .
the case was brought by the european commission in january after finance ministers decided to suspend disciplinary action against france and germany for breaching the rules that underpin the euro .
these rules state that countries in the euro-zone - the 12 member states that use the currency - must not run a budget deficit above 3 percent of gross domestic product over a year .
this deficit ceiling has been repeatedly broken by paris and berlin - the euro-zone 's two biggest economies .
the commission has thus decided to initiate legal action against the two countries that could end in billion-euro fines being levied on france and germany .
meanwhile , in a separate development , one of the main critics of france and germany , the netherlands , announced on wednesday that its budget deficit would also exceed the 3 percent limit .

on the final day of the afghanistan donor conference in berlin , the international community agreed to aid the country in its battle against drugs and committed its troops to work to increase security ahead of elections . coming one day after donor nations offered billions of dollars in financial support for afghanistan , the delegations from 56 countries on thursday pledged to afghan president hamid karzai that his government would not be left alone in its attempts to stabilize the war-torn country . nato members told karzai that troops from the isaf peacekeeping force would stay in afghanistan until the local authorities could ensure security . donor countries pledged a total of $ 8.2 billion in aid over the next three years to afghanistan on the first day of the conference on wednesday .
the country is set to receive $ 4.4 billion of the sum by march 20 , 2005 .
the world bank estimated that afghanistan would need $ 27.5 billion over the next seven years for reconstruction . karzai 's assessment of the two-day conference was a positive one : " i am a very satisfied man today . " stabilization a priority before elections conference participants are also discussing how to stabilize the country , which is still plagued by lawlessness and poor security conditions , particularly in the remote mountainous regions outside the capital of kabul . regional warlords and tribal chiefs control whole areas of afghanistan , pursuing their own interests , which often run counter to those of the central government .
one of the main issues at the conference is providing a safe backdrop for the first free presidential and parliamentary elections in september . the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , currently led by nato and composed of 5,500 troops from numerous countries is charged with ensuring security in kabul and its surroundings .
germany has 2,000 soldiers among the isaf troops , including a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in the north of the country . nato on thursday said it may sent up to five new prts to afghanistan and italy said it would send 300 troops .
germany is also likely send an extra 250 troops to help keep the peace .
berlin is also helping to train afghan police . fighting drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan men walk through a poppy field in the nangharhar province of afghanistan .
conference delegates also said they would step up the battle against production and trafficking of illegal drugs in and around afghanistan . " drugs and warlordism and terrorism reinforce each other , " karzai said .
" for afghanistan to have peace , we have to address all three at the same time . " an anti-drug treaty signed by afghanistan , china , iran , pakistan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan foresees close cooperation in fighting the flourishing drug trade and opium production as well as consumption .
police and intelligence services will work together to create a so-called " security belt , " to cut off drug smugglers ' access to the border . experts from the countries involved will meet in kabul by june to push forward the anti-drug accord , worked out under british auspices .
" a stable afghanistan with a strong central government is essential to counter-narcotics efforts , " the agreement stated . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose country hosted the conference in berlin , said the agreement was an important step and pledged germany 's support in putting it into practice . the accord comes on the heels of karzai 's warning to the conference delegates from 56 countries that the drug trade and opium cultivation " are threatening the very existence of the afghan state . " indeed , 80 percent of the opium poppies - from which heroin is derived - grown worldwide come from afghanistan .
along with disarming warlords and militias , the fight against the drug trade remains one of the most daunting challenges facing the country . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghan donor conference pledges $ 8.2 billion in aid germany , the u.s. and other wealthy countries responded to afghan president hamid karzai 's appeal to help his country " stand on its own strong feet " by pledging $ 8.2 billion next year for reconstruction aid .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .

german actress uschi glass has put her well-known name on a new face cream that 's turned out to be a flop , according to a consumer protection organization .
the actress is taking the testing group to court . the new uschi glass face cream was supposed to make your face soft and silky , reduce those irritating lines that come with age , and leave you looking young and radiant .
what those women actually trying out the cream got instead were pimples , irritation and scaly skin . the women were lathering on the face cream for stiftung warentest , a consumer organization that tests and rates new products on the market .
every fourth tester taking the uschi glass treatment broke off the regimen early due to dermatological distress .
the consumer group gave the pricey product - a jar will put you back € 33 - a " deficient " rating , which could ring the death knell for the new cream . " we 've never seen so many negative skin reactions as we have with this cream , " a spokesperson for the consumer group told the abendzeitung newspaper in munich . uschi is not going to watch her face cream discredited without a fight .
she 's taking stiftung warentest to court . the consumer group , however , is taking a relaxed attitude toward the whole affair . " a lot of people have tried to sue us , " said the spokesperson .
" no one 's ever won . " it 's not the first time glass has been in the press for questionable judgment .

the actress is taking the testing group to court . the new uschi glass face cream was supposed to make your face soft and silky , reduce those irritating lines that come with age , and leave you looking young and radiant .
what those women actually trying out the cream got instead were pimples , irritation and scaly skin . the women were lathering on the face cream for stiftung warentest , a consumer organization that tests and rates new products on the market .
every fourth tester taking the uschi glass treatment broke off the regimen early due to dermatological distress .
the consumer group gave the pricey product - a jar will put you back € 33 - a " deficient " rating , which could ring the death knell for the new cream . " we 've never seen so many negative skin reactions as we have with this cream , " a spokesperson for the consumer group told the abendzeitung newspaper in munich . uschi is not going to watch her face cream discredited without a fight .
she 's taking stiftung warentest to court . the consumer group , however , is taking a relaxed attitude toward the whole affair . " a lot of people have tried to sue us , " said the spokesperson .
" no one 's ever won . " it 's not the first time glass has been in the press for questionable judgment .

on the final day of the afghanistan donor conference in berlin , the international community agreed to aid the country in its battle against drugs and committed its troops to work to increase security ahead of elections . coming one day after donor nations offered billions of dollars in financial support for afghanistan , the delegations from 56 countries on thursday pledged to afghan president hamid karzai that his government would not be left alone in its attempts to stabilize the war-torn country . nato members told karzai that troops from the isaf peacekeeping force would stay in afghanistan until the local authorities could ensure security . donor countries pledged a total of $ 8.2 billion in aid over the next three years to afghanistan on the first day of the conference on wednesday .
the country is set to receive $ 4.4 billion of the sum by march 20 , 2005 .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

on the final day of the afghanistan donor conference in berlin , the international community agreed to aid the country in its battle against drugs and committed its troops to work to increase security ahead of elections . coming one day after donor nations offered billions of dollars in financial support for afghanistan , the delegations from 56 countries on thursday pledged to afghan president hamid karzai that his government would not be left alone in its attempts to stabilize the war-torn country . nato members told karzai that troops from the isaf peacekeeping force would stay in afghanistan until the local authorities could ensure security . donor countries pledged a total of $ 8.2 billion in aid over the next three years to afghanistan on the first day of the conference on wednesday .
the country is set to receive $ 4.4 billion of the sum by march 20 , 2005 .
the world bank estimated that afghanistan would need $ 27.5 billion over the next seven years for reconstruction . karzai 's assessment of the two-day conference was a positive one : " i am a very satisfied man today . " stabilization a priority before elections conference participants are also discussing how to stabilize the country , which is still plagued by lawlessness and poor security conditions , particularly in the remote mountainous regions outside the capital of kabul . regional warlords and tribal chiefs control whole areas of afghanistan , pursuing their own interests , which often run counter to those of the central government .
one of the main issues at the conference is providing a safe backdrop for the first free presidential and parliamentary elections in september . the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , currently led by nato and composed of 5,500 troops from numerous countries is charged with ensuring security in kabul and its surroundings .
germany has 2,000 soldiers among the isaf troops , including a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in the north of the country . nato on thursday said it may sent up to five new prts to afghanistan and italy said it would send 300 troops .
germany is also likely send an extra 250 troops to help keep the peace .
berlin is also helping to train afghan police . fighting drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan men walk through a poppy field in the nangharhar province of afghanistan .
conference delegates also said they would step up the battle against production and trafficking of illegal drugs in and around afghanistan . " drugs and warlordism and terrorism reinforce each other , " karzai said .
" for afghanistan to have peace , we have to address all three at the same time . " an anti-drug treaty signed by afghanistan , china , iran , pakistan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan foresees close cooperation in fighting the flourishing drug trade and opium production as well as consumption .
police and intelligence services will work together to create a so-called " security belt , " to cut off drug smugglers ' access to the border . experts from the countries involved will meet in kabul by june to push forward the anti-drug accord , worked out under british auspices .
" a stable afghanistan with a strong central government is essential to counter-narcotics efforts , " the agreement stated . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose country hosted the conference in berlin , said the agreement was an important step and pledged germany 's support in putting it into practice . the accord comes on the heels of karzai 's warning to the conference delegates from 56 countries that the drug trade and opium cultivation " are threatening the very existence of the afghan state . " indeed , 80 percent of the opium poppies - from which heroin is derived - grown worldwide come from afghanistan .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators failed wednesday to agree on plans to reunify cyprus .
in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .
" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .
opinion polls have shown that most greek cypriots would say " no " to reunification , and a slim majority of turkish cypriots would vote " yes . " if either referenda fails , only the greek cypriot part of the island , which is internationally recognized , will join the european union on may 1 .
the turkish cypriot north , which is only recognized by ankara , will remain internationally isolated .
turkey will also face a setback to its efforts to join the eu .
ethnically-based federation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots cross the un buffer zone south to the greek cypriot controlled ledra palace checkpoint in april 2003 .
greek and turkish cypriots some began crossing from one side to the other of their divided island for the first time since 29-year-old travel restrictions were lifted by the turkish side earlier in the month .
the failed proposals , some details of which were leaked to the press , called for a republic led by a federal state made up of both greek and turkish cypriots .
greek cypriots and returnees would have been restricted from moving to the turkish part of the island and from buying property there .
turkish soldiers would have remained stationed in the north as well . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece in 1974 .
around 160,000 greek cypriots fled from their homes when turkey invaded .
since then thousands of turks have settled on the island .
greek cypriots make up around two-thirds of cyprus ' 800,000 population .
they are far wealthier than the turkish cypriots who control one-third of the country . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de countdown begins for cyprus reunification deal u.n. secretary general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .

in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .
" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .

on the final day of the afghanistan donor conference in berlin , the international community agreed to aid the country in its battle against drugs and committed its troops to work to increase security ahead of elections . coming one day after donor nations offered billions of dollars in financial support for afghanistan , the delegations from 56 countries on thursday pledged to afghan president hamid karzai that his government would not be left alone in its attempts to stabilize the war-torn country . nato members told karzai that troops from the isaf peacekeeping force would stay in afghanistan until the local authorities could ensure security . donor countries pledged a total of $ 8.2 billion in aid over the next three years to afghanistan on the first day of the conference on wednesday .
the country is set to receive $ 4.4 billion of the sum by march 20 , 2005 .
the world bank estimated that afghanistan would need $ 27.5 billion over the next seven years for reconstruction . karzai 's assessment of the two-day conference was a positive one : " i am a very satisfied man today . " stabilization a priority before elections conference participants are also discussing how to stabilize the country , which is still plagued by lawlessness and poor security conditions , particularly in the remote mountainous regions outside the capital of kabul . regional warlords and tribal chiefs control whole areas of afghanistan , pursuing their own interests , which often run counter to those of the central government .
one of the main issues at the conference is providing a safe backdrop for the first free presidential and parliamentary elections in september . the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , currently led by nato and composed of 5,500 troops from numerous countries is charged with ensuring security in kabul and its surroundings .
germany has 2,000 soldiers among the isaf troops , including a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in the north of the country . nato on thursday said it may sent up to five new prts to afghanistan and italy said it would send 300 troops .
germany is also likely send an extra 250 troops to help keep the peace .
berlin is also helping to train afghan police . fighting drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan men walk through a poppy field in the nangharhar province of afghanistan .

" for afghanistan to have peace , we have to address all three at the same time . " an anti-drug treaty signed by afghanistan , china , iran , pakistan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan foresees close cooperation in fighting the flourishing drug trade and opium production as well as consumption .

" a stable afghanistan with a strong central government is essential to counter-narcotics efforts , " the agreement stated . german foreign minister joschka fischer , whose country hosted the conference in berlin , said the agreement was an important step and pledged germany 's support in putting it into practice . the accord comes on the heels of karzai 's warning to the conference delegates from 56 countries that the drug trade and opium cultivation " are threatening the very existence of the afghan state .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

" that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .
that figure falls short of the kabul government 's three-year goal of raising $ 11.9 billion dollars , but eclipse the $ 4.5 billion pledged at the 2002 tokyo donors conference .
a dollar a day afghanistan is one of the world 's poorest countries .
some four million of its 25 million population live on less than 50 u.s. cents a day , ghani said during the conference .
" our priority is precisely to ensure a move from abject poverty to poverty with dignity - at least a dollar a day , " he told reporters .
" we 're not asking for the mercedes-benz of development , we 're asking for the basic bicycle of development , " he said .
karzai 's government is seeking roughly $ 28 billion for the next seven years .
it says the money is essential to help rebuild the nation and make it self-sufficient in the near future .
speaking to the delegates at the conference , karzai called for " sustained assistance " from those countries who have stood by afghanistan so far .
" let us see that afghanistan in a few years will not be a burden on your shoulders , but a state that will stand on his own strong feet , " he said .
pledges roll in " the united states will not abandon you , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told karzai as he offered $ 1 billion in aid on top of the $ 1.2 billion washington has already committed for this year .
the european union pledged € 700 million -lrb- $ 852 million -rrb- for this year , with individual countries also offering their assistance .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose country has traditionally provided the largest amount of financial aid in europe , pledged € 320 million over the next four years .
italy offered more than € 140 million over the next three years .
japan offered $ 400 million over the next two years and the asian development bank pledged about $ 1 billion in loans and grants between 2005 and 2008 .
in addition , russia and afghanistan are reportedly in negotiation over a debt write-off that would forgive afghanistan 80 percent of the some $ 10 billion it owes moscow and would open the way for russia to give aid to a country it once occupied . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for political stability the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country .

in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators failed wednesday to agree on plans to reunify cyprus .
in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .
" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .
opinion polls have shown that most greek cypriots would say " no " to reunification , and a slim majority of turkish cypriots would vote " yes . " if either referenda fails , only the greek cypriot part of the island , which is internationally recognized , will join the european union on may 1 .
the turkish cypriot north , which is only recognized by ankara , will remain internationally isolated .
turkey will also face a setback to its efforts to join the eu .

greek and turkish cypriots some began crossing from one side to the other of their divided island for the first time since 29-year-old travel restrictions were lifted by the turkish side earlier in the month .
the failed proposals , some details of which were leaked to the press , called for a republic led by a federal state made up of both greek and turkish cypriots .
greek cypriots and returnees would have been restricted from moving to the turkish part of the island and from buying property there .
turkish soldiers would have remained stationed in the north as well . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece in 1974 .
around 160,000 greek cypriots fled from their homes when turkey invaded .
since then thousands of turks have settled on the island .
greek cypriots make up around two-thirds of cyprus ' 800,000 population .
they are far wealthier than the turkish cypriots who control one-third of the country . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de countdown begins for cyprus reunification deal u.n. secretary general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.04.2004 afghanistan conference ends with focus on drugs , security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister fischer and afghan president karzai close the talks in berlin .
on the final day of the afghanistan donor conference in berlin , the international community agreed to aid the country in its battle against drugs and committed its troops to work to increase security ahead of elections . coming one day after donor nations offered billions of dollars in financial support for afghanistan , the delegations from 56 countries on thursday pledged to afghan president hamid karzai that his government would not be left alone in its attempts to stabilize the war-torn country . nato members told karzai that troops from the isaf peacekeeping force would stay in afghanistan until the local authorities could ensure security . donor countries pledged a total of $ 8.2 billion in aid over the next three years to afghanistan on the first day of the conference on wednesday .
the country is set to receive $ 4.4 billion of the sum by march 20 , 2005 .
the world bank estimated that afghanistan would need $ 27.5 billion over the next seven years for reconstruction . karzai 's assessment of the two-day conference was a positive one : " i am a very satisfied man today . " stabilization a priority before elections conference participants are also discussing how to stabilize the country , which is still plagued by lawlessness and poor security conditions , particularly in the remote mountainous regions outside the capital of kabul . regional warlords and tribal chiefs control whole areas of afghanistan , pursuing their own interests , which often run counter to those of the central government .
one of the main issues at the conference is providing a safe backdrop for the first free presidential and parliamentary elections in september . the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , currently led by nato and composed of 5,500 troops from numerous countries is charged with ensuring security in kabul and its surroundings .
germany has 2,000 soldiers among the isaf troops , including a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in the north of the country . nato on thursday said it may sent up to five new prts to afghanistan and italy said it would send 300 troops .
germany is also likely send an extra 250 troops to help keep the peace .
berlin is also helping to train afghan police . fighting drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan men walk through a poppy field in the nangharhar province of afghanistan .
conference delegates also said they would step up the battle against production and trafficking of illegal drugs in and around afghanistan . " drugs and warlordism and terrorism reinforce each other , " karzai said .
" for afghanistan to have peace , we have to address all three at the same time . " an anti-drug treaty signed by afghanistan , china , iran , pakistan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan foresees close cooperation in fighting the flourishing drug trade and opium production as well as consumption .
police and intelligence services will work together to create a so-called " security belt , " to cut off drug smugglers ' access to the border . experts from the countries involved will meet in kabul by june to push forward the anti-drug accord , worked out under british auspices .

on the final day of the afghanistan donor conference in berlin , the international community agreed to aid the country in its battle against drugs and committed its troops to work to increase security ahead of elections . coming one day after donor nations offered billions of dollars in financial support for afghanistan , the delegations from 56 countries on thursday pledged to afghan president hamid karzai that his government would not be left alone in its attempts to stabilize the war-torn country . nato members told karzai that troops from the isaf peacekeeping force would stay in afghanistan until the local authorities could ensure security . donor countries pledged a total of $ 8.2 billion in aid over the next three years to afghanistan on the first day of the conference on wednesday .
the country is set to receive $ 4.4 billion of the sum by march 20 , 2005 .
the world bank estimated that afghanistan would need $ 27.5 billion over the next seven years for reconstruction . karzai 's assessment of the two-day conference was a positive one : " i am a very satisfied man today . " stabilization a priority before elections conference participants are also discussing how to stabilize the country , which is still plagued by lawlessness and poor security conditions , particularly in the remote mountainous regions outside the capital of kabul . regional warlords and tribal chiefs control whole areas of afghanistan , pursuing their own interests , which often run counter to those of the central government .
one of the main issues at the conference is providing a safe backdrop for the first free presidential and parliamentary elections in september . the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , currently led by nato and composed of 5,500 troops from numerous countries is charged with ensuring security in kabul and its surroundings .
germany has 2,000 soldiers among the isaf troops , including a provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in kunduz in the north of the country . nato on thursday said it may sent up to five new prts to afghanistan and italy said it would send 300 troops .
germany is also likely send an extra 250 troops to help keep the peace .
berlin is also helping to train afghan police . fighting drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan men walk through a poppy field in the nangharhar province of afghanistan .

" for afghanistan to have peace , we have to address all three at the same time . " an anti-drug treaty signed by afghanistan , china , iran , pakistan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan foresees close cooperation in fighting the flourishing drug trade and opium production as well as consumption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2004 anti-semitism on the rise in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young males with right-wing outlooks are behind many attacks , the report says .
a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .
that figure falls short of the kabul government 's three-year goal of raising $ 11.9 billion dollars , but eclipse the $ 4.5 billion pledged at the 2002 tokyo donors conference .
a dollar a day afghanistan is one of the world 's poorest countries .
some four million of its 25 million population live on less than 50 u.s. cents a day , ghani said during the conference .
" our priority is precisely to ensure a move from abject poverty to poverty with dignity - at least a dollar a day , " he told reporters .
" we 're not asking for the mercedes-benz of development , we 're asking for the basic bicycle of development , " he said .
karzai 's government is seeking roughly $ 28 billion for the next seven years .
it says the money is essential to help rebuild the nation and make it self-sufficient in the near future .
speaking to the delegates at the conference , karzai called for " sustained assistance " from those countries who have stood by afghanistan so far .
" let us see that afghanistan in a few years will not be a burden on your shoulders , but a state that will stand on his own strong feet , " he said .
pledges roll in " the united states will not abandon you , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told karzai as he offered $ 1 billion in aid on top of the $ 1.2 billion washington has already committed for this year .
the european union pledged € 700 million -lrb- $ 852 million -rrb- for this year , with individual countries also offering their assistance .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose country has traditionally provided the largest amount of financial aid in europe , pledged € 320 million over the next four years .
italy offered more than € 140 million over the next three years .
japan offered $ 400 million over the next two years and the asian development bank pledged about $ 1 billion in loans and grants between 2005 and 2008 .
in addition , russia and afghanistan are reportedly in negotiation over a debt write-off that would forgive afghanistan 80 percent of the some $ 10 billion it owes moscow and would open the way for russia to give aid to a country it once occupied . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for political stability the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .
that figure falls short of the kabul government 's three-year goal of raising $ 11.9 billion dollars , but eclipse the $ 4.5 billion pledged at the 2002 tokyo donors conference .

" we 're not asking for the mercedes-benz of development , we 're asking for the basic bicycle of development , " he said .
karzai 's government is seeking roughly $ 28 billion for the next seven years .
it says the money is essential to help rebuild the nation and make it self-sufficient in the near future .
speaking to the delegates at the conference , karzai called for " sustained assistance " from those countries who have stood by afghanistan so far .
" let us see that afghanistan in a few years will not be a burden on your shoulders , but a state that will stand on his own strong feet , " he said .
pledges roll in " the united states will not abandon you , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told karzai as he offered $ 1 billion in aid on top of the $ 1.2 billion washington has already committed for this year .
the european union pledged € 700 million -lrb- $ 852 million -rrb- for this year , with individual countries also offering their assistance .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose country has traditionally provided the largest amount of financial aid in europe , pledged € 320 million over the next four years .
italy offered more than € 140 million over the next three years .
japan offered $ 400 million over the next two years and the asian development bank pledged about $ 1 billion in loans and grants between 2005 and 2008 .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

on the final day of the afghanistan donor conference in berlin , the international community agreed to aid the country in its battle against drugs and committed its troops to work to increase security ahead of elections . coming one day after donor nations offered billions of dollars in financial support for afghanistan , the delegations from 56 countries on thursday pledged to afghan president hamid karzai that his government would not be left alone in its attempts to stabilize the war-torn country . nato members told karzai that troops from the isaf peacekeeping force would stay in afghanistan until the local authorities could ensure security . donor countries pledged a total of $ 8.2 billion in aid over the next three years to afghanistan on the first day of the conference on wednesday .
the country is set to receive $ 4.4 billion of the sum by march 20 , 2005 .
the world bank estimated that afghanistan would need $ 27.5 billion over the next seven years for reconstruction . karzai 's assessment of the two-day conference was a positive one : " i am a very satisfied man today . " stabilization a priority before elections conference participants are also discussing how to stabilize the country , which is still plagued by lawlessness and poor security conditions , particularly in the remote mountainous regions outside the capital of kabul . regional warlords and tribal chiefs control whole areas of afghanistan , pursuing their own interests , which often run counter to those of the central government .
one of the main issues at the conference is providing a safe backdrop for the first free presidential and parliamentary elections in september . the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , currently led by nato and composed of 5,500 troops from numerous countries is charged with ensuring security in kabul and its surroundings .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators failed wednesday to agree on plans to reunify cyprus .
in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .
" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .
opinion polls have shown that most greek cypriots would say " no " to reunification , and a slim majority of turkish cypriots would vote " yes . " if either referenda fails , only the greek cypriot part of the island , which is internationally recognized , will join the european union on may 1 .
the turkish cypriot north , which is only recognized by ankara , will remain internationally isolated .
turkey will also face a setback to its efforts to join the eu .
ethnically-based federation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish cypriots cross the un buffer zone south to the greek cypriot controlled ledra palace checkpoint in april 2003 .
greek and turkish cypriots some began crossing from one side to the other of their divided island for the first time since 29-year-old travel restrictions were lifted by the turkish side earlier in the month .
the failed proposals , some details of which were leaked to the press , called for a republic led by a federal state made up of both greek and turkish cypriots .
greek cypriots and returnees would have been restricted from moving to the turkish part of the island and from buying property there .
turkish soldiers would have remained stationed in the north as well . cyprus has been divided since turkey invaded the north in response to a failed greek cypriot coup that was supported by greece in 1974 .
around 160,000 greek cypriots fled from their homes when turkey invaded .
since then thousands of turks have settled on the island .
greek cypriots make up around two-thirds of cyprus ' 800,000 population .
they are far wealthier than the turkish cypriots who control one-third of the country . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de countdown begins for cyprus reunification deal u.n. secretary general annan has presented greek and turkish cypriots with a revised blueprint for a future united cyprus .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .
that figure falls short of the kabul government 's three-year goal of raising $ 11.9 billion dollars , but eclipse the $ 4.5 billion pledged at the 2002 tokyo donors conference .

karzai 's government is seeking roughly $ 28 billion for the next seven years .
it says the money is essential to help rebuild the nation and make it self-sufficient in the near future .
speaking to the delegates at the conference , karzai called for " sustained assistance " from those countries who have stood by afghanistan so far .
" let us see that afghanistan in a few years will not be a burden on your shoulders , but a state that will stand on his own strong feet , " he said .
pledges roll in " the united states will not abandon you , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told karzai as he offered $ 1 billion in aid on top of the $ 1.2 billion washington has already committed for this year .

italy offered more than € 140 million over the next three years .
japan offered $ 400 million over the next two years and the asian development bank pledged about $ 1 billion in loans and grants between 2005 and 2008 .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .
that figure falls short of the kabul government 's three-year goal of raising $ 11.9 billion dollars , but eclipse the $ 4.5 billion pledged at the 2002 tokyo donors conference .
a dollar a day afghanistan is one of the world 's poorest countries .
some four million of its 25 million population live on less than 50 u.s. cents a day , ghani said during the conference .
" our priority is precisely to ensure a move from abject poverty to poverty with dignity - at least a dollar a day , " he told reporters .
" we 're not asking for the mercedes-benz of development , we 're asking for the basic bicycle of development , " he said .
karzai 's government is seeking roughly $ 28 billion for the next seven years .
it says the money is essential to help rebuild the nation and make it self-sufficient in the near future .
speaking to the delegates at the conference , karzai called for " sustained assistance " from those countries who have stood by afghanistan so far .
" let us see that afghanistan in a few years will not be a burden on your shoulders , but a state that will stand on his own strong feet , " he said .
pledges roll in " the united states will not abandon you , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told karzai as he offered $ 1 billion in aid on top of the $ 1.2 billion washington has already committed for this year .
the european union pledged € 700 million -lrb- $ 852 million -rrb- for this year , with individual countries also offering their assistance .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , whose country has traditionally provided the largest amount of financial aid in europe , pledged € 320 million over the next four years .
italy offered more than € 140 million over the next three years .
japan offered $ 400 million over the next two years and the asian development bank pledged about $ 1 billion in loans and grants between 2005 and 2008 .
in addition , russia and afghanistan are reportedly in negotiation over a debt write-off that would forgive afghanistan 80 percent of the some $ 10 billion it owes moscow and would open the way for russia to give aid to a country it once occupied . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a peaceful afghanistan is an anchor for political stability the third international conference on afghanistan opened in berlin on wednesday with an inaugural speech by german chancellor schröder promising more financial aid to the war-torn country .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators failed wednesday to agree on plans to reunify cyprus .
in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .
" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .
opinion polls have shown that most greek cypriots would say " no " to reunification , and a slim majority of turkish cypriots would vote " yes . " if either referenda fails , only the greek cypriot part of the island , which is internationally recognized , will join the european union on may 1 .
the turkish cypriot north , which is only recognized by ankara , will remain internationally isolated .
turkey will also face a setback to its efforts to join the eu .

greek and turkish cypriot negotiators failed wednesday to agree on plans to reunify cyprus .
in late april it will be up to the island 's residents to vote on u.n. chief annan 's plan for one cypriot state . u.n. secretary general kofi annan presented his proposal for the future of a reunified cyprus early thursday morning , after ten days of talks failed to bridge differences between greek and turkish cypriots .
annan 's blueprint for peace will be now be voted upon by the divided mediterranean island 's people in two separate referenda on april 24 .
both sides must approve the plan for cyprus to be reunified . " the chance is between this settlement or no settlement , " annan said .
" this plan is fair and designed to work . " the negotiations between green and turkish cypriots and their respective governments in the swiss resort town of bürgenstock hinged on the number of greek and turkish troops that would remain on the island , property rights , freedom of movement and eu law .
in the end , the greek cypriot side was unwilling to authorize the peace plan annan had drafted , saying it demanded too many concessions from them . the turkish cypriots however , were largely satisfied with their part of the deal .
" we could not imagine a solution more marvellous than this , " a turkish diplomat told reporters . " we got everything we wanted .
they -lrb- the greeks -rrb- lost .
it 's that simple . " it appears unlikely that cypriots will approve an arrangement that their leadership disagreed with .
opinion polls have shown that most greek cypriots would say " no " to reunification , and a slim majority of turkish cypriots would vote " yes . " if either referenda fails , only the greek cypriot part of the island , which is internationally recognized , will join the european union on may 1 .
the turkish cypriot north , which is only recognized by ankara , will remain internationally isolated .
turkey will also face a setback to its efforts to join the eu .

afghan finance minister ashraf ghani announced that $ 4.4 billion -lrb- € 3.59 billion -rrb- had already been promised for 2004-2005 .
" this is 100 percent of our target , " he told a press conference at the close of the first day of the donor conference , which addresses ways to stabilize the afghanistan 's political and economic reconstruction .
the minister said he was " delighted " with the pledges which poured in after afghan president hamid karzai appealed to officials from more than 50 countries to help his country " stand on its own strong feet . "
ghani said that donor nations had also agreed to commit a total of $ 8.2 billion for the coming three years .
that figure falls short of the kabul government 's three-year goal of raising $ 11.9 billion dollars , but eclipse the $ 4.5 billion pledged at the 2002 tokyo donors conference .

" let us see that afghanistan in a few years will not be a burden on your shoulders , but a state that will stand on his own strong feet , " he said .
pledges roll in " the united states will not abandon you , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told karzai as he offered $ 1 billion in aid on top of the $ 1.2 billion washington has already committed for this year .

japan offered $ 400 million over the next two years and the asian development bank pledged about $ 1 billion in loans and grants between 2005 and 2008 .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom . " cancer is back " jewish leaders were split over their reactions .
cobi benatoff , president of the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , hailed the report for raising awareness of anti-semitism and calling for european leaders to take action . " the old cancer is back , " he said . however , speaking at the report 's launch , he mentioned that there were " some contradictions " between it and a previous investigation that had found that many of the perpetrators of anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . taking a harsher tone , serge cwajgenbaum , the ejc 's secretary , said the report was " full of contradictions " and criticised the findings for not properly addressing the identity of the culprits . " how can you fight anti-semitism without having the courage to identify its authors ? " he said . his comments could reignite the controversy that broke out in december after it emerged that the eumc had shelved a report compiled by berlin 's technical university due to its sensitive content .
that investigation had blamed rising anti-semitic attacks on muslim immigrant and pro-palestinian groups who were angered by israeli policy in the west bank and gaza strip . at the time , benatoff said the issue smacked of censorship . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu vows to combat anti-semitism the european commission 's president called for member states to take a hard line against anti-semitism , after a day-long seminar with jewish and other european leaders in brussels .

a report released by a racism watchdog group shows that anti-semitic incidents increased in five european countries in 2002-2003 , including germany .
the report received both praise and criticism from jewish leaders . the report , put out by the vienna-based european monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- , found that anti-semitic attacks , ranging from hate mail to arson , increased in germany , britain , france , the netherlands and belgium last year and the year before . " europe has a problem with anti-semitism , manifestations of which have been getting more frequent in some parts of the eu over the last two or three years , " the report said . it identified as the largest group of perpetrators , " young , disaffected white europeans , " and identified a further source of anti-semitic attacks to be " young muslims of north african or asian extraction . " that finding contradicts an earlier , controversial report , commissioned by the eumc , that had found most of those carrying out anti-semitic attacks were young muslims . the current 344-page document , whose authors conducted research in all 15 eu states , also found that anti-semitic comments were " particularly virulent " in austria , italy , spain and greece , although attacks were " relatively rare . " incidents against jews were not reported in ireland , luxembourg , portugal or finland , although the eumc warned that data-gathering techniques varied greatly among eu nations , which made it difficult to make clear comparisons . france , home to europe 's largest jewish community , had the highest number of incidents .
in 2002 , anti-semitic attacks increased six-fold from the year before . " there were many incidents of jewish people assaulted and insulted , attacks against synagogues , cemeteries and other jewish property , and arson against a jewish school , " the report said . skinheads in germany germany saw anti-semitic attacks rise by 69 percent from 1999 to 2000 , although they eased somewhat in 2002 .
the report noted that jewish organizations in the country have seen a " great increase " in anti-semitic letters , e-mails and telephone calls over the last two years . attacks in germany were largely the actions of skinheads , according to beate winkler , director of the monitoring center . " that is still the largest group , " she said , adding that the report 's overall findings were enough to cause " fear and great distress " among europe 's 1.2 million jews . while the statistics were not positive , the report did say that action by the eu to confront the problem could be effective .
it encouraged eu leaders to take a " strong leadership position " on the topic and urged european states to cooperate more closely to fight racism . it proposed that nations check schoolbooks for racist bias and recommended that teachers be trained to talk about race discrimination in the classroom .

avon and somerset police , which is behind the initiative , says the boxes will help fight crime at the machines .
the aim is to thwart tactics like " shoulder surfing " whereby would-be robbers try to spot users ' pin numbers .
after a successful pilot scheme in broadmead , the boxes have been brought in at 14 other banks and building societies in the city centre .
it is hoped the yellow areas will encourage queuing people to stand outside the box , allowing privacy for the person using the machine .
if someone steps into the " safe " space , police say the card user can legitimately ask why the person has done that .
john hirst , the manager of broadmead , where the pilot took place , said : " creating a defensible space in front of cash machines seems to reduce the number of robberies associated with these machines .
" research has revealed that they have many benefits , not least increasing the awareness of the user , which in turn makes it more difficult for a criminal to maintain close proximity to potential victims . "

the woodchester pavement replica was made by two brothers after they visited the original - which is buried in a churchyard near stroud - in the 1970s .
until now the huge artwork has only been displayed in parts , and on special occasions .
but now there are plans to exhibit it permanently in the recently closed pottery at prinknash abbey .
also known as the orpheus pavement , the original mosaic was made of one-and-a-half million pieces of stone .
the idea is that everybody owns it and everybody can enjoy it and come to see it whenever they like .
adrian jones manager , prinknash abbey more pictures it was last uncovered in 1973 , when 140,000 people viewed it , but is unlikely to be revealed again .
the replica took brothers bob and john woodward eight years to create and has been acclaimed by academics for its accuracy and beauty .
adrian jones , the general manager of prinknash abbey , said : " we are hoping to set up a trust company which can own and manage the pavement on behalf of the people of gloucestershire and the uk as a whole .
" the idea is that everybody owns it and everybody can enjoy it and come to see it whenever they like . "
bob woodward said : " i think it is vitally important for gloucestershire .
" there is no way you can see the original mosaic - i believe there are no plans for it to ever be opened up again - but here is an opportunity to see the roman mosaic in all its glory with all its missing pieces filled in . "
a temporary exhibition , showing about two thirds of the mosaic , will open in the summer , and there are plans to build a second storey on top of the pottery in order to display the whole pavement .

a report by the auditor general for wales , sir john bourn , said the nhs was in deficit by £ 37m in 2002/3 .
the previous year it was £ 16m .
he said the financial situation was a matter of concern .
but his report also found that hospitals paid bills more quickly and progress was made in addressing fraud .
the budget for the nhs in wales for the financial year ending march 2003 was £ 3.5bn. the restoration of financial balance is a priority sir john bourn the accumulated budget shortfall over the same period was £ 100m .
a significant factor in the latest budget shortfall has been the cost of hiring agency nurses to cover staff shortages on the wards .
in 1999-2000 , agency staff cost the welsh nhs £ 8m a year .
by 2003 , the cost had risen to £ 18m .
the welsh assembly government has launched a number of initiatives to reduce this expenditure .
but sir john 's report had more welcome financial news .
the amount paid out for clinical negligence and personal injury has stabilised at around £ 43m .
he said hospitals were now quicker at paying their bills , and progress had been made in dealing with fraud - for example , fraud from opticians has fallen by 25 % .
discipline sir john said the priority should now be to reverse what he described as the " deficit culture " in the service 's financial management .
he said : " the overall financial state of the nhs in wales continues to be a matter of concern .
" clearly the reversal of this situation and the restoration of financial balance is a priority .
" the minister and the director of nhs wales recognise that the deficit culture must be addressed and managed effectively .
" the creation of a single audit body for wales will provide a more focused accountability regime for nhs wales and we will closely monitor the measures introduced to restore financial discipline . "

a conference organised by universities in north-east england , suggests the world 's dialects are multiplying faster than ever before .
previous research showed old dialects were declining because of greater social mobility .
but linguists say caribbean and asian languages are now having a big impact .
more than 400 of the world 's leading linguists are due at a conference in newcastle , organised by a team from the universities of newcastle , northumbria , sunderland and durham .
native tongue the new findings quash fears that globalisation is leading to a standardising of language .
researchers say immigrants to areas such as europe , the us and australia are creating completely new dialects when they learn the language of their host country by mixing it with aspects of their native tongue .
black english terms include babymother , meaning the mother of one or more of a person 's children ; irie - nice , good , or pleasing ; and big something up , which is slang for recommend or praise something .
other west indian terms in the oxford dictionary of english include facety - meaning rude , arrogant , or excessively bold , probably influenced by the english word feisty - and bad-minded , which is short for malicious , unsympathetic , or cynical .
asian english terms include gora , which is a term for a white person and chuddies - slang for underpants .
social mobility the number of dialects is expected to increase even more rapidly over the next few years as asylum seekers from countries from bosnia to iraq continue to seek refuge in other nations .
newcastle university linguist dr karen corrigan , one of the conference organisers , said : " language has always developed over time but at the moment it is changing much faster than it ever has done as a result of increased opportunities for social and geographical mobility .
" research still suggests that your dialect or accent remains an important indicator of your social status .
" it 's just that the expanding number of varieties means that people have a greater choice of where to place themselves in society . "
she said it was difficult to say how new migrants would affect the languages of their host communities in the long term .

but linguists say caribbean and asian languages are now having a big impact .
more than 400 of the world 's leading linguists are due at a conference in newcastle , organised by a team from the universities of newcastle , northumbria , sunderland and durham .
native tongue the new findings quash fears that globalisation is leading to a standardising of language .
researchers say immigrants to areas such as europe , the us and australia are creating completely new dialects when they learn the language of their host country by mixing it with aspects of their native tongue .
black english terms include babymother , meaning the mother of one or more of a person 's children ; irie - nice , good , or pleasing ; and big something up , which is slang for recommend or praise something .
other west indian terms in the oxford dictionary of english include facety - meaning rude , arrogant , or excessively bold , probably influenced by the english word feisty - and bad-minded , which is short for malicious , unsympathetic , or cynical .
asian english terms include gora , which is a term for a white person and chuddies - slang for underpants .
social mobility the number of dialects is expected to increase even more rapidly over the next few years as asylum seekers from countries from bosnia to iraq continue to seek refuge in other nations .
newcastle university linguist dr karen corrigan , one of the conference organisers , said : " language has always developed over time but at the moment it is changing much faster than it ever has done as a result of increased opportunities for social and geographical mobility .
" research still suggests that your dialect or accent remains an important indicator of your social status .
" it 's just that the expanding number of varieties means that people have a greater choice of where to place themselves in society . "
she said it was difficult to say how new migrants would affect the languages of their host communities in the long term .

bus lane cameras will be used to catch motorists carrying out offences like wrongly driving into a box junction or turning right across a restricted lane .
the councils taking part in the nine-month pilot across the city are camden , ealing , newham , croydon , wandsworth , hammersmith and fulham .
money raised through fines will be used to fund transport improvements .
most of the councils , which have been given the new powers under the local authorities and transport for london act 2003 , are not expected to begin fining people for a couple of months .

" these are regulations laid down in the highway code and against the law which could have been prosecuted through the police .

anyone blocking footpaths and roads with , for example , skips and displays outside shops will also face £ 100 fines .
and operators face a £ 500 fine and drivers could be fined £ 100 , rather than being prosecuted , if they break the london lorry ban which stops noisy truck journeys at night and weekends .

the tankan survey revealed improved optimism in all major sectors of the japanese economy .
business confidence among big manufacturers was at its strongest level since june 1997 .
the turnaround in the service sector was even more dramatic , showing the best mood since may 1992 .
japanese businesses have been nervous about the yen 's strength against the weakened dollar , but the tankan survey suggests such fears are receding .
domestic growth japan 's service sector has languished in the doldrums for years as consumers have stubbornly ignored government efforts to persuade people to spend more money to boost japan 's listless economy .
but the tankan sub-index for big service sector firms came in at a confidence reading of + 5 for the first three months of 2004 , compared with zero last time .
service sector readings have been negative for the last four years .
for big manufacturers , the index rose to + 12 from + 7 .
the sector includes many globally significant exporters , particularly in consumer electronics firms and car makers .
caution the upbeat outlook has also spread to small firms , the tankan found .
it is the latest sign of a pick-up in the japanese economy , where gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew at its best rate for 13 years in the final quarter of 2003 .
" the improvement in confidence at small firms is very encouraging because it suggests this is no longer simply an export-driven recovery , but that the benefits of export growth are filtering through to the domestic economy , " richard jerram , chief economist at ing bank in tokyo told the bbc 's world business report .
however , he warned that it was still too early to draw a line under japan 's economic troubles .
" i think it 's premature to say that japan does n't need to worry about what happens in the rest of the world , " he said .
" we 've seen too many false dawns in the past decade to believe that this time it 's for real , until we see that deflation is beaten and the financial system is functioning again . "

the tankan survey revealed improved optimism in all major sectors of the japanese economy .
business confidence among big manufacturers was at its strongest level since june 1997 .
the turnaround in the service sector was even more dramatic , showing the best mood since may 1992 .
japanese businesses have been nervous about the yen 's strength against the weakened dollar , but the tankan survey suggests such fears are receding .
domestic growth japan 's service sector has languished in the doldrums for years as consumers have stubbornly ignored government efforts to persuade people to spend more money to boost japan 's listless economy .
but the tankan sub-index for big service sector firms came in at a confidence reading of + 5 for the first three months of 2004 , compared with zero last time .
service sector readings have been negative for the last four years .
for big manufacturers , the index rose to + 12 from + 7 .
the sector includes many globally significant exporters , particularly in consumer electronics firms and car makers .
caution the upbeat outlook has also spread to small firms , the tankan found .
it is the latest sign of a pick-up in the japanese economy , where gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew at its best rate for 13 years in the final quarter of 2003 .
" the improvement in confidence at small firms is very encouraging because it suggests this is no longer simply an export-driven recovery , but that the benefits of export growth are filtering through to the domestic economy , " richard jerram , chief economist at ing bank in tokyo told the bbc 's world business report .
however , he warned that it was still too early to draw a line under japan 's economic troubles .

" so many aspects of life are being ' dumbed down ' , but this is the complete opposite .

fifty one people appeared in court for rioting , with sentences handed down mounting to more than 80 years .
the arrests were made after fighting between local residents and iraqi kurds on the estate on 22 june 2002 .
north wales police stepped up patrols in the area and visited youngsters as young as five to build a better relationship with the next generation .
i want to educate them into seeing that the police are n't only here for conflict situations and we 're here to help pc mel brace sergeant darren jacks and his five community beat managers have been appointed to look after north wales ' biggest council estate on a daily basis .
since they were put in place last year crime has fallen by 16 % and the majority of children and parents have got used to seeing more bobbies on the beat .
pc melanie brace looks after the whitegate ward of the estate .
she has decided to educate children up to the age of 11 about her role on the estate , to teach them not to be scared of her and treat her as a friend .
troubles she calls about twice a week to gwenfro infants and junior schools .
" my aim is to try and educate them while they are at this early age .
they are on an estate where there have been a lot of troubles lately and they might 've only seen us in conflict situations , " she said .
" i want to educate them into seeing that the police are n't only here for conflict situations and we 're here to help . "
pc brace first started visiting the school shortly before the disturbances on caia park .
the violent outbreak last summer followed friction between a number of iraqis and longer-term residents of caia park in wrexham .
but police blamed a criminal element for taking advantage of the situation .
she says that since the troubles she has managed to win pupils around .
" when i first started coming into the school about 11 months ago , they were very , very quiet , i 'd walk into the class and you could feel the tension , even though they are young you could see they were intimidated by me , " she said .
pc brace sees children during their lessons " i just came in , sat down , let them play with things on my belt and introduced myself slowly , quite quickly they warmed to me .
" now when they see me they do n't think trouble anymore , they think ' oh great mel 's here , let 's go and play ' . "
the friendly officer walks from classroom to classroom where she is greeted by hugs from the girls and enthusiastic waves from the boys .
she is presented with drawings which have been made for her and they all know her name instantly .
" when i 'm out and about parents come up and say ' you 're mel , you go to my daughter 's school , ' it 's nice , " she said .
a police surgery is also held at the school every four weeks so parents can drop their children off and then come into the office if they have any problems they wish to discuss .
pc brace says she has noticed a difference on the estate since she started last year and the children want to help improve the area 's image .
" you hear them say , ' let 's go and do this ' and then one will say ' no , no mel wo n't like it ' . "
" last night someone was trying to pull stickers off the car and one of the boys said ' do n't do that , it 's mel 's car ' . "
jan ashford , headteacher at gwenfro school says mel has made a big impression on her pupils who are " not afraid to talk to her about anything " .

in the future , you could authorise payments by simply moving your finger over your flexible friend .
a leading professor at the massachusetts institute of technology has suggested using radio tags in credit cards as a kind of virtual signature .
professor ted selker said the way someone moved their finger over the card would alter the radio transmission , producing a signal unique to that person .
" i could have some gesture and that would be my signature , " he said , " it would be like a personal handshake . "
the idea of putting radio tags in credit cards is not as far-fetched as it sounds .
mastercard has been experimenting with the technology , known as radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- .
us trials rfid tags are tiny transponders that send out radio signals and some experts predict they will become commonplace over the next decade or so . "
i could draw letters and it would tell just by where my finger is how that is affecting the radio signal , whether or not it was me " ted selker , mit media labs the use of the technology in credit cards has been tested by mastercard .
last year it ran a nine-month pilot in the us , involving some 15,000 consumers .
people could pay for goods by waving their cards near special tills , which would receive the information transmitted by the cards .
prof selker has suggested taking the technology a step further and using the properties of radio waves as a security check .
" by watching a finger moving around an antenna , we can literally see that the finger changes the antenna 's behaviour , " he told bbc news online .
" i could draw letters and it would tell just by where my finger is how that is affecting the radio signal , whether or not it was me . "
on-off cards he suggested this could be used to make a rfid system that could complement or replace other ways of authorising a credit card .
" would n't it be great if we could get the protection of having a personal identification number , without having to have a pad to type it into ? " asked prof selker , who heads the context aware computing group at the mit 's media labs .
" would n't it be nice if something better than my signature would be transmitted without me having to use an external device ? "
civil rights groups have expressed concerns about rfid technology for some time .
they worry it means people could , in theory , be tracked by the tags .
" you do n't necessarily want a credit card that can be detected when you are not using it , " said technology expert bill thompson .
" you want a button that can turn it off or on . "
" otherwise imagine if you are a thief , you just wander around with a rfid detector looking for people with these credit cards . "

" would n't it be great if we could get the protection of having a personal identification number , without having to have a pad to type it into ? " asked prof selker , who heads the context aware computing group at the mit 's media labs .
" would n't it be nice if something better than my signature would be transmitted without me having to use an external device ? "
civil rights groups have expressed concerns about rfid technology for some time .
they worry it means people could , in theory , be tracked by the tags .
" you do n't necessarily want a credit card that can be detected when you are not using it , " said technology expert bill thompson .

recent strong growth figures mask the difficulty of the task which lies ahead .
desire kamanzi 's father sold his three houses in burundi to return to rwanda in 1994 .
he is not unusual .
since the genocide ended in 1994 , exiled rwandans have been coming home from burundi , congo , uganda and tanzania .
" these people have been fighting all their lives , they have earned good money , they brought it home , " mr kamanzi , now head of investment promotion at rwanda investment promotion agency , said .
this cash has fuelled much of the construction around kigali .
starting low since 1994 , the rwandan economy has registered an average of 8 % economic growth a year , a figure which reflects the low point of departure as much as the achievement made .
in the year of the genocide , growth slumped by 50 % and inflation reached 64 % .
" starting from scratch , you will see these big jumps .
to sustain this , there are more policies you need to put in place , " mr kamanzi admitted .
and it is these next steps that the rwandan administration is now grappling with .
the streets of kigali carry posters , reminding people that paying taxes will build the nation and new institutions , such as rwanda revenue authority , should help the government increase revenues .
claver gatete , secretary-general in the ministry of finance , said that the government wants to increase non-traditional exports , thus reducing their heavy reliance on foreign funds .
almost two thirds of the 8.1 million population live below the poverty line , and the world bank estimates that gdp per capita was $ 250 in 2000 .
in many cases , it is even lower .
outside of kigali , bean planters hadimana wellars , 22 , and mbarushimana theogene , 34 , earn just $ 16 or 12,000 rwandan francs a month .
abandoned coffee rwanda earns much of its foreign exchange from tea and coffee .
rwanda needs to add value to its exports to increase these earnings , leon haguma , acting director of coffee marketing board ocir- cafe , said .
" all was abandoned , they were dead or had fled the country , there was nobody to work the plantations , " mr haguma said of the situation in 1994 .
the country exported just 14,000 tonnes of coffee last year , hit partly by drought and disease. nowhere near the peak of 42,000 tonnes in 1986 .
now , american coffee chain starbucks is interested in buying rwandan coffee and mr haguma argues that making specialty coffee will boost incomes .
most of the 400,000 families who grow coffee , grow ' ordinary ' coffee .
this sold last year for $ 1 a kilo in mombasa port .
specialty or ' fully washed ' coffee can sell for between $ 1.8 and $ 3 a kilo .
as yet , this specialty coffee accounts for only a fraction of the country 's exports .
money trickles down there is some evidence of new investment in rwanda and the benefits could be trickling down to local businesses and employees .
one of kigali 's premier locations is the five star hotel intercontinental , owned partly by the government .
it opened for business earlier this year .
" it brings investment , it brings jobs , it also brings in expertise to train , " george cohen , the hotel 's general manager , said .
the hotel works with local suppliers , training them to provide the cuts of meat or preserves previously not available locally .
late last year , terracom broadband started offering broadband internet services to businesses .
wolfgang hey , one of the founding staff members , says rwanda 's location within east africa is an advantage .
" we are certainly going to become national within rwanda , we are going to move out of kigali , once we have expanded to our borders , it makes sense to expand beyond , " mr hey said .
survivors ' grief rwanda 's tiny land mass makes investing in people and in ict a logical step to attract investment , he said .
their biggest customer is the government , though banks and ngos follow close behind .
mr hey said : " bureaucracy is a problem ... even if someone desperately wants to help you , their hands are bound , because of the way policies are laid out , he ca n't . "
getting through the commemoration month of april is hard in many ways , he said .
business may be open but very little will be happening .
" society as a whole makes allowances for individuals ' grief , " he said .
no one could have predicted the strides rwanda has made in the past ten years , ripa 's mr kamanzi said .
" the love the rwandan people have for their country , their commitment ...
all this will be achieved , " he added .

recent strong growth figures mask the difficulty of the task which lies ahead .
desire kamanzi 's father sold his three houses in burundi to return to rwanda in 1994 .
he is not unusual .
since the genocide ended in 1994 , exiled rwandans have been coming home from burundi , congo , uganda and tanzania .
" these people have been fighting all their lives , they have earned good money , they brought it home , " mr kamanzi , now head of investment promotion at rwanda investment promotion agency , said .
this cash has fuelled much of the construction around kigali .
starting low since 1994 , the rwandan economy has registered an average of 8 % economic growth a year , a figure which reflects the low point of departure as much as the achievement made .
rwandan small coffee growers are hoping for better times in the year of the genocide , growth slumped by 50 % and inflation reached 64 % .
" starting from scratch , you will see these big jumps .
to sustain this , there are more policies you need to put in place , " mr kamanzi admitted .
