the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .
for the time being , the un has puts its negotiating efforts on ice . rainer sollich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus misses " an historic opportunity " world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .

german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .
negotiations have remained deadlocked since the norwegian-backed talks to end the separatist conflict broke up in april last year .
norway 's deputy foreign minister vidar helgesen is expected in colombo next weekend to meet with sri lankan government leaders and tamil tiger rebels on reviving the quest for peace , special envoy erik solheim said sunday .
investment potential fischer , who is traveling with a business delegation and has made a point about increasing german trade to the region as a further aspect of stability , said sri lanka had " great potential " for investment and offered colombo two million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to fund the integration of sri lanka in a business information network for the south asian association for regional cooperation -lrb- saarc -rrb- .
saarc seeks to bring bangladesh , bhutan , india , maldives , nepal , pakistan and now sri lanka closer together by promoting regional economic and social cooperation .

the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .
for the time being , the un has puts its negotiating efforts on ice . rainer sollich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus misses " an historic opportunity " world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .

german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .
negotiations have remained deadlocked since the norwegian-backed talks to end the separatist conflict broke up in april last year .
norway 's deputy foreign minister vidar helgesen is expected in colombo next weekend to meet with sri lankan government leaders and tamil tiger rebels on reviving the quest for peace , special envoy erik solheim said sunday .
investment potential fischer , who is traveling with a business delegation and has made a point about increasing german trade to the region as a further aspect of stability , said sri lanka had " great potential " for investment and offered colombo two million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to fund the integration of sri lanka in a business information network for the south asian association for regional cooperation -lrb- saarc -rrb- .
saarc seeks to bring bangladesh , bhutan , india , maldives , nepal , pakistan and now sri lanka closer together by promoting regional economic and social cooperation .

" however , it is becoming quite clear that such a solution is impossible as long as palestinian leader yasser arafat continues to exert his dire influence , " the london paper wrote .
it noted that since 1948 the tragedy of the palestinians has been the failure of their leaders to negotiate on a realistic basis .
" perhaps , the palestinians could learn from a history lesson , " the paper hoped .
the austrian paper der standard described the gaza strip as slipping into " anarchy . "
it said the situation resembled a " power struggle riding on a wave of anger over mismanagement . "
the spanish el pais regarded the past few days as ushering in the beginnings of the fight for arafat ’ s political death .
it wrote that this could be very short and is something which the negotiating peace partners such as israel , the united states and europe are secretly hoping for .
the french paper le croix commented that arafat is about to discourage a whole generation of impatient palestinians because of his handing out of important administration posts to old friends .
" a true head of state , " it said , " would have prepared a generation for change .
but with yasser arafat it looks as if it will all go backwards .
how can one persuade arafat that he can not continue in his leadership , " the paper pondered .
the swiss tages-anzeiger pointedly noted that the palestinians hungered and suffered under the israelis while their own political leaders drove around in air-conditioned sedans and decorated their bathrooms with italian marble funded by international aid money .
the genf-based paper observed that under the leadership of yassir arafat corruption and nepotism have become synonyms for authority .
" today arafat is harvesting the fruits of the palestinians ' anger , " it concluded . newslink send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .
general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .
in a speech in berlin last march , schröder said : " i am certain that , in light of our contributions to the war against terror , that our friends in america will also support this wish .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.07.2004 airbus , boeing duel at air show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are reporting clear skies for the airline industry the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry . with airline traffic largely recovered following the sept .
11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the outlook for the aviation market is once again improving .
" we have good signs of recovery , " said philippe camus , ceo of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .
boeing bets on smaller planes , more non-stops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer drawing of a boeing 7e7 dreamliner with the paint scheme of italy-based charter carrier blue panorama .
the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .
" we are not receiving subsidies , " airbus ceo camus said .
" we are receiving loans and we will repay the loans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 european press review : sowing palestinian anger the violent demonstrations in the gaza strip and the power struggle within yasser arafat 's palestinian authority were the top stories across europe on monday . the british daily telegraph acknowledged that it is has for a long time favored the two-state solution , allowing israelis and palestinians to live behind safe borders .
" however , it is becoming quite clear that such a solution is impossible as long as palestinian leader yasser arafat continues to exert his dire influence , " the london paper wrote .
it noted that since 1948 the tragedy of the palestinians has been the failure of their leaders to negotiate on a realistic basis .
" perhaps , the palestinians could learn from a history lesson , " the paper hoped .
the austrian paper der standard described the gaza strip as slipping into " anarchy . "
it said the situation resembled a " power struggle riding on a wave of anger over mismanagement . "
the spanish el pais regarded the past few days as ushering in the beginnings of the fight for arafat ’ s political death .
it wrote that this could be very short and is something which the negotiating peace partners such as israel , the united states and europe are secretly hoping for .
the french paper le croix commented that arafat is about to discourage a whole generation of impatient palestinians because of his handing out of important administration posts to old friends .
" a true head of state , " it said , " would have prepared a generation for change .
but with yasser arafat it looks as if it will all go backwards .
how can one persuade arafat that he can not continue in his leadership , " the paper pondered .
the swiss tages-anzeiger pointedly noted that the palestinians hungered and suffered under the israelis while their own political leaders drove around in air-conditioned sedans and decorated their bathrooms with italian marble funded by international aid money .
the genf-based paper observed that under the leadership of yassir arafat corruption and nepotism have become synonyms for authority .
" today arafat is harvesting the fruits of the palestinians ' anger , " it concluded . newslink send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .
he added that this should also be the case if a criminal moves to a different european country .
" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .
germany , for example , said that it would be an infringement on national sovereignty . pietro petrucci , the eu commission spokesman , said he still hoped that a universal criminal register would be introduced .

in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .

german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .
negotiations have remained deadlocked since the norwegian-backed talks to end the separatist conflict broke up in april last year .
norway 's deputy foreign minister vidar helgesen is expected in colombo next weekend to meet with sri lankan government leaders and tamil tiger rebels on reviving the quest for peace , special envoy erik solheim said sunday .
investment potential fischer , who is traveling with a business delegation and has made a point about increasing german trade to the region as a further aspect of stability , said sri lanka had " great potential " for investment and offered colombo two million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to fund the integration of sri lanka in a business information network for the south asian association for regional cooperation -lrb- saarc -rrb- .
saarc seeks to bring bangladesh , bhutan , india , maldives , nepal , pakistan and now sri lanka closer together by promoting regional economic and social cooperation .

" however , it is becoming quite clear that such a solution is impossible as long as palestinian leader yasser arafat continues to exert his dire influence , " the london paper wrote .
it noted that since 1948 the tragedy of the palestinians has been the failure of their leaders to negotiate on a realistic basis .
" perhaps , the palestinians could learn from a history lesson , " the paper hoped .
the austrian paper der standard described the gaza strip as slipping into " anarchy . "
it said the situation resembled a " power struggle riding on a wave of anger over mismanagement . "
the spanish el pais regarded the past few days as ushering in the beginnings of the fight for arafat ’ s political death .
it wrote that this could be very short and is something which the negotiating peace partners such as israel , the united states and europe are secretly hoping for .
the french paper le croix commented that arafat is about to discourage a whole generation of impatient palestinians because of his handing out of important administration posts to old friends .
" a true head of state , " it said , " would have prepared a generation for change .
but with yasser arafat it looks as if it will all go backwards .
how can one persuade arafat that he can not continue in his leadership , " the paper pondered .
the swiss tages-anzeiger pointedly noted that the palestinians hungered and suffered under the israelis while their own political leaders drove around in air-conditioned sedans and decorated their bathrooms with italian marble funded by international aid money .
the genf-based paper observed that under the leadership of yassir arafat corruption and nepotism have become synonyms for authority .
" today arafat is harvesting the fruits of the palestinians ' anger , " it concluded . newslink send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it wrote that this could be very short and is something which the negotiating peace partners such as israel , the united states and europe are secretly hoping for .
the french paper le croix commented that arafat is about to discourage a whole generation of impatient palestinians because of his handing out of important administration posts to old friends .
" a true head of state , " it said , " would have prepared a generation for change .
but with yasser arafat it looks as if it will all go backwards .
how can one persuade arafat that he can not continue in his leadership , " the paper pondered .
the swiss tages-anzeiger pointedly noted that the palestinians hungered and suffered under the israelis while their own political leaders drove around in air-conditioned sedans and decorated their bathrooms with italian marble funded by international aid money .
the genf-based paper observed that under the leadership of yassir arafat corruption and nepotism have become synonyms for authority .
" today arafat is harvesting the fruits of the palestinians ' anger , " it concluded . newslink send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .
negotiations have remained deadlocked since the norwegian-backed talks to end the separatist conflict broke up in april last year .
norway 's deputy foreign minister vidar helgesen is expected in colombo next weekend to meet with sri lankan government leaders and tamil tiger rebels on reviving the quest for peace , special envoy erik solheim said sunday .
investment potential fischer , who is traveling with a business delegation and has made a point about increasing german trade to the region as a further aspect of stability , said sri lanka had " great potential " for investment and offered colombo two million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to fund the integration of sri lanka in a business information network for the south asian association for regional cooperation -lrb- saarc -rrb- .
saarc seeks to bring bangladesh , bhutan , india , maldives , nepal , pakistan and now sri lanka closer together by promoting regional economic and social cooperation .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .
general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .

france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border still divides north and south cyprus thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .
the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .
for the time being , the un has puts its negotiating efforts on ice . rainer sollich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus misses " an historic opportunity " world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .
europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry .
-lrb- april 25 , 2004 -rrb- eu hits greek cypriots in pocketbook after ' no ' vote angered by greek cypriots ' vote against reunification , eu foreign ministers pledge to help push the divided island 's turkish residents back into the international fold .

the leader of bavaria is calling for citizens to have a say in the new treaty . edmund stoiber , state premier and the leader of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has re-opened the debate in germany by saying that there should be a referendum on the new eu constitution , although germany 's own constitution does not allow for this .
" if france , following the uk , is now also going to have a referendum on the constitution , then the third big country in the eu will not be able to hold out for much longer , " stoiber told bild am sonntag .
the government should " finally put aside their mistrust of their own citizens , " he added .
" it would be best if all heads of state and government of the european union would fix a referendum on the constitution . "
however , stoiber 's words are at odds with other voices in the csu 's sister party the christian democrats union .
peter hintze , the spokesperson for europe in the cdu , said a referendum would be the " wrong path . "
for his part , german chancellor gerhard schröder has said there will be no referendum and instead pledged to see the constitution ratified by german parliament before the end of this year .
but schröder is coming under pressure as some social democrats and greens are also calling for a referendum .

" we have good signs of recovery , " said philippe camus , ceo of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .
boeing bets on smaller planes , more non-stops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer drawing of a boeing 7e7 dreamliner with the paint scheme of italy-based charter carrier blue panorama .
the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .
general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .
in a speech in berlin last march , schröder said : " i am certain that , in light of our contributions to the war against terror , that our friends in america will also support this wish .

german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .
negotiations have remained deadlocked since the norwegian-backed talks to end the separatist conflict broke up in april last year .
norway 's deputy foreign minister vidar helgesen is expected in colombo next weekend to meet with sri lankan government leaders and tamil tiger rebels on reviving the quest for peace , special envoy erik solheim said sunday .
investment potential fischer , who is traveling with a business delegation and has made a point about increasing german trade to the region as a further aspect of stability , said sri lanka had " great potential " for investment and offered colombo two million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to fund the integration of sri lanka in a business information network for the south asian association for regional cooperation -lrb- saarc -rrb- .
saarc seeks to bring bangladesh , bhutan , india , maldives , nepal , pakistan and now sri lanka closer together by promoting regional economic and social cooperation .

boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .
for the time being , the un has puts its negotiating efforts on ice . rainer sollich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus misses " an historic opportunity " world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .
europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry .
-lrb- april 25 , 2004 -rrb- eu hits greek cypriots in pocketbook after ' no ' vote angered by greek cypriots ' vote against reunification , eu foreign ministers pledge to help push the divided island 's turkish residents back into the international fold .
-lrb- april 26 , 2004 -rrb- greek cypriots say " no " to reunification greek cypriots on saturday voted overwhelmingly against reunification with turkish cypriots , sounding the death knell for a un-backed peace plan to end a 30-year division of the island .

the leader of bavaria is calling for citizens to have a say in the new treaty . edmund stoiber , state premier and the leader of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has re-opened the debate in germany by saying that there should be a referendum on the new eu constitution , although germany 's own constitution does not allow for this .
" if france , following the uk , is now also going to have a referendum on the constitution , then the third big country in the eu will not be able to hold out for much longer , " stoiber told bild am sonntag .
the government should " finally put aside their mistrust of their own citizens , " he added .
" it would be best if all heads of state and government of the european union would fix a referendum on the constitution . "
however , stoiber 's words are at odds with other voices in the csu 's sister party the christian democrats union .
peter hintze , the spokesperson for europe in the cdu , said a referendum would be the " wrong path . "
for his part , german chancellor gerhard schröder has said there will be no referendum and instead pledged to see the constitution ratified by german parliament before the end of this year .
but schröder is coming under pressure as some social democrats and greens are also calling for a referendum .

the leader of bavaria is calling for citizens to have a say in the new treaty . edmund stoiber , state premier and the leader of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has re-opened the debate in germany by saying that there should be a referendum on the new eu constitution , although germany 's own constitution does not allow for this .
" if france , following the uk , is now also going to have a referendum on the constitution , then the third big country in the eu will not be able to hold out for much longer , " stoiber told bild am sonntag .
the government should " finally put aside their mistrust of their own citizens , " he added .
" it would be best if all heads of state and government of the european union would fix a referendum on the constitution . "
however , stoiber 's words are at odds with other voices in the csu 's sister party the christian democrats union .
peter hintze , the spokesperson for europe in the cdu , said a referendum would be the " wrong path . "
for his part , german chancellor gerhard schröder has said there will be no referendum and instead pledged to see the constitution ratified by german parliament before the end of this year .
but schröder is coming under pressure as some social democrats and greens are also calling for a referendum .

" however , it is becoming quite clear that such a solution is impossible as long as palestinian leader yasser arafat continues to exert his dire influence , " the london paper wrote .
it noted that since 1948 the tragedy of the palestinians has been the failure of their leaders to negotiate on a realistic basis .
" perhaps , the palestinians could learn from a history lesson , " the paper hoped .
the austrian paper der standard described the gaza strip as slipping into " anarchy . "
it said the situation resembled a " power struggle riding on a wave of anger over mismanagement . "
the spanish el pais regarded the past few days as ushering in the beginnings of the fight for arafat ’ s political death .
it wrote that this could be very short and is something which the negotiating peace partners such as israel , the united states and europe are secretly hoping for .
the french paper le croix commented that arafat is about to discourage a whole generation of impatient palestinians because of his handing out of important administration posts to old friends .
" a true head of state , " it said , " would have prepared a generation for change .
but with yasser arafat it looks as if it will all go backwards .
how can one persuade arafat that he can not continue in his leadership , " the paper pondered .
the swiss tages-anzeiger pointedly noted that the palestinians hungered and suffered under the israelis while their own political leaders drove around in air-conditioned sedans and decorated their bathrooms with italian marble funded by international aid money .
the genf-based paper observed that under the leadership of yassir arafat corruption and nepotism have become synonyms for authority .
" today arafat is harvesting the fruits of the palestinians ' anger , " it concluded . newslink send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

prospects are also improving for boeing .

the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .
" we are not receiving subsidies , " airbus ceo camus said .
" we are receiving loans and we will repay the loans .

in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .
he added that this should also be the case if a criminal moves to a different european country .
" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .
germany , for example , said that it would be an infringement on national sovereignty . pietro petrucci , the eu commission spokesman , said he still hoped that a universal criminal register would be introduced .

the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .
he added that this should also be the case if a criminal moves to a different european country .
" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .
germany , for example , said that it would be an infringement on national sovereignty . pietro petrucci , the eu commission spokesman , said he still hoped that a universal criminal register would be introduced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.07.2004 airbus , boeing duel at air show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are reporting clear skies for the airline industry the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry . with airline traffic largely recovered following the sept .
11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the outlook for the aviation market is once again improving .
" we have good signs of recovery , " said philippe camus , ceo of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .
boeing bets on smaller planes , more non-stops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer drawing of a boeing 7e7 dreamliner with the paint scheme of italy-based charter carrier blue panorama .
the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .
" we are not receiving subsidies , " airbus ceo camus said .
" we are receiving loans and we will repay the loans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border still divides north and south cyprus thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .
the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .
for the time being , the un has puts its negotiating efforts on ice . rainer sollich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus misses " an historic opportunity " world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.07.2004 sri lanka hedges on german bid for security council großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lakshman kadirgamar -lrb- left -rrb- wants to leave all options open .
german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .
general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .
general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .

the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .
for the time being , the un has puts its negotiating efforts on ice . rainer sollich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus misses " an historic opportunity " world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .

the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.07.2004 airbus , boeing duel at air show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are reporting clear skies for the airline industry the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry . with airline traffic largely recovered following the sept .
11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the outlook for the aviation market is once again improving .
" we have good signs of recovery , " said philippe camus , ceo of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .
boeing bets on smaller planes , more non-stops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer drawing of a boeing 7e7 dreamliner with the paint scheme of italy-based charter carrier blue panorama .
the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

" we have good signs of recovery , " said philippe camus , ceo of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .
boeing bets on smaller planes , more non-stops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer drawing of a boeing 7e7 dreamliner with the paint scheme of italy-based charter carrier blue panorama .
the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 eu rules out central criminal register großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate was prompted by the confessions of killer fourniret eu justice and interior ministers agreed to step up information exchanges on national criminal records , but stopped short of creating a single criminal register for the entire 25-nation bloc . germany , france and spain all agreed they would speed up plans to share data on convicted criminals by electronically linking their national registers .
in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .
he added that this should also be the case if a criminal moves to a different european country .
" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .
germany , for example , said that it would be an infringement on national sovereignty . pietro petrucci , the eu commission spokesman , said he still hoped that a universal criminal register would be introduced .
it 's sad , but europe needs tragedies such as the fourniret case to move forward , he said . " political advances often require something shocking , " he said , adding that europe needed the shock of the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 eu rules out central criminal register großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate was prompted by the confessions of killer fourniret eu justice and interior ministers agreed to step up information exchanges on national criminal records , but stopped short of creating a single criminal register for the entire 25-nation bloc . germany , france and spain all agreed they would speed up plans to share data on convicted criminals by electronically linking their national registers .
in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .
he added that this should also be the case if a criminal moves to a different european country .
" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .
germany , for example , said that it would be an infringement on national sovereignty . pietro petrucci , the eu commission spokesman , said he still hoped that a universal criminal register would be introduced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border still divides north and south cyprus thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .
the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .

" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .

boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .

airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .
boeing bets on smaller planes , more non-stops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer drawing of a boeing 7e7 dreamliner with the paint scheme of italy-based charter carrier blue panorama .
the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .
" we are not receiving subsidies , " airbus ceo camus said .
" we are receiving loans and we will repay the loans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.07.2004 airbus , boeing duel at air show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are reporting clear skies for the airline industry the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry . with airline traffic largely recovered following the sept .
11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the outlook for the aviation market is once again improving .
" we have good signs of recovery , " said philippe camus , ceo of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .
boeing bets on smaller planes , more non-stops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer drawing of a boeing 7e7 dreamliner with the paint scheme of italy-based charter carrier blue panorama .
the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .

general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .
in a speech in berlin last march , schröder said : " i am certain that , in light of our contributions to the war against terror , that our friends in america will also support this wish .

in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .
he added that this should also be the case if a criminal moves to a different european country .
" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .
germany , for example , said that it would be an infringement on national sovereignty . pietro petrucci , the eu commission spokesman , said he still hoped that a universal criminal register would be introduced .

despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .

in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .
general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .
general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .

german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .
negotiations have remained deadlocked since the norwegian-backed talks to end the separatist conflict broke up in april last year .
norway 's deputy foreign minister vidar helgesen is expected in colombo next weekend to meet with sri lankan government leaders and tamil tiger rebels on reviving the quest for peace , special envoy erik solheim said sunday .
investment potential fischer , who is traveling with a business delegation and has made a point about increasing german trade to the region as a further aspect of stability , said sri lanka had " great potential " for investment and offered colombo two million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to fund the integration of sri lanka in a business information network for the south asian association for regional cooperation -lrb- saarc -rrb- .

for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .

peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .
negotiations have remained deadlocked since the norwegian-backed talks to end the separatist conflict broke up in april last year .
norway 's deputy foreign minister vidar helgesen is expected in colombo next weekend to meet with sri lankan government leaders and tamil tiger rebels on reviving the quest for peace , special envoy erik solheim said sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border still divides north and south cyprus thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .
the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .
for the time being , the un has puts its negotiating efforts on ice . rainer sollich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus misses " an historic opportunity " world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .
europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry .
-lrb- april 25 , 2004 -rrb- eu hits greek cypriots in pocketbook after ' no ' vote angered by greek cypriots ' vote against reunification , eu foreign ministers pledge to help push the divided island 's turkish residents back into the international fold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.07.2004 sri lanka hedges on german bid for security council großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lakshman kadirgamar -lrb- left -rrb- wants to leave all options open .
german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .

german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .

" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .
general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .

the leader of bavaria is calling for citizens to have a say in the new treaty . edmund stoiber , state premier and the leader of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has re-opened the debate in germany by saying that there should be a referendum on the new eu constitution , although germany 's own constitution does not allow for this .
" if france , following the uk , is now also going to have a referendum on the constitution , then the third big country in the eu will not be able to hold out for much longer , " stoiber told bild am sonntag .
the government should " finally put aside their mistrust of their own citizens , " he added .
" it would be best if all heads of state and government of the european union would fix a referendum on the constitution . "
however , stoiber 's words are at odds with other voices in the csu 's sister party the christian democrats union .
peter hintze , the spokesperson for europe in the cdu , said a referendum would be the " wrong path . "
for his part , german chancellor gerhard schröder has said there will be no referendum and instead pledged to see the constitution ratified by german parliament before the end of this year .
but schröder is coming under pressure as some social democrats and greens are also calling for a referendum .

despite this , one politician wants to impose a tax on grilled meat fans to keep the city clean . on balmy summer evenings , berlin parks do tend to look a bit messy as many barbecue fans seem to forget to clean up after themselves .

" however , it is becoming quite clear that such a solution is impossible as long as palestinian leader yasser arafat continues to exert his dire influence , " the london paper wrote .
it noted that since 1948 the tragedy of the palestinians has been the failure of their leaders to negotiate on a realistic basis .
" perhaps , the palestinians could learn from a history lesson , " the paper hoped .
the austrian paper der standard described the gaza strip as slipping into " anarchy . "
it said the situation resembled a " power struggle riding on a wave of anger over mismanagement . "
the spanish el pais regarded the past few days as ushering in the beginnings of the fight for arafat ’ s political death .
it wrote that this could be very short and is something which the negotiating peace partners such as israel , the united states and europe are secretly hoping for .
the french paper le croix commented that arafat is about to discourage a whole generation of impatient palestinians because of his handing out of important administration posts to old friends .
" a true head of state , " it said , " would have prepared a generation for change .
but with yasser arafat it looks as if it will all go backwards .
how can one persuade arafat that he can not continue in his leadership , " the paper pondered .
the swiss tages-anzeiger pointedly noted that the palestinians hungered and suffered under the israelis while their own political leaders drove around in air-conditioned sedans and decorated their bathrooms with italian marble funded by international aid money .
the genf-based paper observed that under the leadership of yassir arafat corruption and nepotism have become synonyms for authority .
" today arafat is harvesting the fruits of the palestinians ' anger , " it concluded . newslink send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border still divides north and south cyprus thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .
the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .
for the time being , the un has puts its negotiating efforts on ice . rainer sollich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus misses " an historic opportunity " world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .

the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .

the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .
for the time being , the un has puts its negotiating efforts on ice . rainer sollich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus misses " an historic opportunity " world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .

" we have good signs of recovery , " said philippe camus , ceo of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .
boeing bets on smaller planes , more non-stops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer drawing of a boeing 7e7 dreamliner with the paint scheme of italy-based charter carrier blue panorama .
the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .

airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.07.2004 sri lanka hedges on german bid for security council großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lakshman kadirgamar -lrb- left -rrb- wants to leave all options open .
german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .
negotiations have remained deadlocked since the norwegian-backed talks to end the separatist conflict broke up in april last year .
norway 's deputy foreign minister vidar helgesen is expected in colombo next weekend to meet with sri lankan government leaders and tamil tiger rebels on reviving the quest for peace , special envoy erik solheim said sunday .
investment potential fischer , who is traveling with a business delegation and has made a point about increasing german trade to the region as a further aspect of stability , said sri lanka had " great potential " for investment and offered colombo two million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to fund the integration of sri lanka in a business information network for the south asian association for regional cooperation -lrb- saarc -rrb- .
saarc seeks to bring bangladesh , bhutan , india , maldives , nepal , pakistan and now sri lanka closer together by promoting regional economic and social cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 eu rules out central criminal register großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate was prompted by the confessions of killer fourniret eu justice and interior ministers agreed to step up information exchanges on national criminal records , but stopped short of creating a single criminal register for the entire 25-nation bloc . germany , france and spain all agreed they would speed up plans to share data on convicted criminals by electronically linking their national registers .
in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .
he added that this should also be the case if a criminal moves to a different european country .
" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .
germany , for example , said that it would be an infringement on national sovereignty . pietro petrucci , the eu commission spokesman , said he still hoped that a universal criminal register would be introduced .
it 's sad , but europe needs tragedies such as the fourniret case to move forward , he said . " political advances often require something shocking , " he said , adding that europe needed the shock of the sept .

" however , it is becoming quite clear that such a solution is impossible as long as palestinian leader yasser arafat continues to exert his dire influence , " the london paper wrote .
it noted that since 1948 the tragedy of the palestinians has been the failure of their leaders to negotiate on a realistic basis .
" perhaps , the palestinians could learn from a history lesson , " the paper hoped .
the austrian paper der standard described the gaza strip as slipping into " anarchy . "
it said the situation resembled a " power struggle riding on a wave of anger over mismanagement . "
the spanish el pais regarded the past few days as ushering in the beginnings of the fight for arafat ’ s political death .
it wrote that this could be very short and is something which the negotiating peace partners such as israel , the united states and europe are secretly hoping for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 debate on referendum heats up in germany germany is still divided over whether to hold a referendum on the new eu constitution .
the leader of bavaria is calling for citizens to have a say in the new treaty . edmund stoiber , state premier and the leader of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has re-opened the debate in germany by saying that there should be a referendum on the new eu constitution , although germany 's own constitution does not allow for this .
" if france , following the uk , is now also going to have a referendum on the constitution , then the third big country in the eu will not be able to hold out for much longer , " stoiber told bild am sonntag .
the government should " finally put aside their mistrust of their own citizens , " he added .
" it would be best if all heads of state and government of the european union would fix a referendum on the constitution . "
however , stoiber 's words are at odds with other voices in the csu 's sister party the christian democrats union .
peter hintze , the spokesperson for europe in the cdu , said a referendum would be the " wrong path . "
for his part , german chancellor gerhard schröder has said there will be no referendum and instead pledged to see the constitution ratified by german parliament before the end of this year .
but schröder is coming under pressure as some social democrats and greens are also calling for a referendum .

the leader of bavaria is calling for citizens to have a say in the new treaty . edmund stoiber , state premier and the leader of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has re-opened the debate in germany by saying that there should be a referendum on the new eu constitution , although germany 's own constitution does not allow for this .
" if france , following the uk , is now also going to have a referendum on the constitution , then the third big country in the eu will not be able to hold out for much longer , " stoiber told bild am sonntag .
the government should " finally put aside their mistrust of their own citizens , " he added .
" it would be best if all heads of state and government of the european union would fix a referendum on the constitution . "
however , stoiber 's words are at odds with other voices in the csu 's sister party the christian democrats union .
peter hintze , the spokesperson for europe in the cdu , said a referendum would be the " wrong path . "
for his part , german chancellor gerhard schröder has said there will be no referendum and instead pledged to see the constitution ratified by german parliament before the end of this year .
but schröder is coming under pressure as some social democrats and greens are also calling for a referendum .

german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .
negotiations have remained deadlocked since the norwegian-backed talks to end the separatist conflict broke up in april last year .
norway 's deputy foreign minister vidar helgesen is expected in colombo next weekend to meet with sri lankan government leaders and tamil tiger rebels on reviving the quest for peace , special envoy erik solheim said sunday .
investment potential fischer , who is traveling with a business delegation and has made a point about increasing german trade to the region as a further aspect of stability , said sri lanka had " great potential " for investment and offered colombo two million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to fund the integration of sri lanka in a business information network for the south asian association for regional cooperation -lrb- saarc -rrb- .
saarc seeks to bring bangladesh , bhutan , india , maldives , nepal , pakistan and now sri lanka closer together by promoting regional economic and social cooperation .

the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .
negotiations have remained deadlocked since the norwegian-backed talks to end the separatist conflict broke up in april last year .
norway 's deputy foreign minister vidar helgesen is expected in colombo next weekend to meet with sri lankan government leaders and tamil tiger rebels on reviving the quest for peace , special envoy erik solheim said sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.07.2004 jockeying for a seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants a permanent place at the security council table talk over reforms have replaced the war in iraq as the issue du jour at the un in new york .
germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .
general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .

" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .

" we have good signs of recovery , " said philippe camus , ceo of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .

the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

" we have good signs of recovery , " said philippe camus , ceo of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .

boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border still divides north and south cyprus thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .
the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .

brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .

in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .

the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .

but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border still divides north and south cyprus thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .
the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .

in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .
he added that this should also be the case if a criminal moves to a different european country .
" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .
germany , for example , said that it would be an infringement on national sovereignty . pietro petrucci , the eu commission spokesman , said he still hoped that a universal criminal register would be introduced .

in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .
he added that this should also be the case if a criminal moves to a different european country .
" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .
germany , for example , said that it would be an infringement on national sovereignty . pietro petrucci , the eu commission spokesman , said he still hoped that a universal criminal register would be introduced .

kraft had wanted to light up the 2,962-meter -lrb- 9,718-foot -rrb- peak in bavaria with more than 100 high-powered floodlights in the hope that the publicity would raise awareness for its environmental conservation efforts .
local opposition politicians and conservation groups such as the german alpine club were against the planned 15-minute lighting , calling it a commercialization of nature .
" without broad support for this event , we do not want to pursue its implementation anymore , " said stephan becker-sonnenschein , spokesman for kraft 's german unit . dw-world.de purple mountain majesties - no thanks !
chocolate maker milka wants to light up germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze , in the company 's trademark color , purple .

german foreign minister joschka fischer continued his five-country asian tour in sri lanka , receiving a cautious response to berlin 's bid to gain a permanent seat on the un security council . after meeting on sunday , fischer 's counterpart lakshman kadirgamar said that colombo supported the united nations reform drive for the sake of " restoring multilateralism . "
the sri lanka foreign minister , however , declined to comment on which countries he favored seeing on an expanded security council .
" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " he told reporters , while stressing that germany was " an important country " on the world stage .
joschka fischer , on a whistlestop tour of asia since early last week , has been meeting with leaders in india , china and bangladesh to drum up support for germany 's proposals to expand the number of permanent members on the un security council .
there are currently five countries with veto power on the council , and berlin wants to see that number grow to 10 .
fence-sitting in asia during earlier stops on the 10-day trip , the german foreign minister received similarly non-committal responses to his appeal to china and bangladesh , who are thought to be hedging their bets while regional giants such as japan and india are also in the running for a permanent seat .
in new delhi , however , both germany and india agreed to back each other .
for new countries to join the security council as permanent members , the support of two-thirds of the un 's more than 190 countries is required to overhaul the institution .
after its vocal opposition to the iraq war , germany is banking on large support from countries who seek to limit the united states ' unilateralism .
peace negotiations during talks on sunday , fischer and kadirgamar also discussed sri lanka 's faltering peace process amid moves by norway to get the government and tamil rebels back to the negotiation table .
the german minister praised government efforts to find a solution to what he called " a tragic conflict " while kadirgamar offered a positive assessment of the chance of engaging in future peace talks .
" i think the will to do so is there , " he said .
negotiations have remained deadlocked since the norwegian-backed talks to end the separatist conflict broke up in april last year .
norway 's deputy foreign minister vidar helgesen is expected in colombo next weekend to meet with sri lankan government leaders and tamil tiger rebels on reviving the quest for peace , special envoy erik solheim said sunday .
investment potential fischer , who is traveling with a business delegation and has made a point about increasing german trade to the region as a further aspect of stability , said sri lanka had " great potential " for investment and offered colombo two million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- to fund the integration of sri lanka in a business information network for the south asian association for regional cooperation -lrb- saarc -rrb- .
saarc seeks to bring bangladesh , bhutan , india , maldives , nepal , pakistan and now sri lanka closer together by promoting regional economic and social cooperation .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .
general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .
general assembly 's approval required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official logo of the united nations moreover , the planned reform of the security council is dragging on .
" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .

germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council . the current division of seats in the united nations security council stems from the time just after world war ii : the then victors , the united states , great britain , france and russia were each allotted a permanent seat along with china .
but now there are calls to expand the number of permanent seats .
" the security council should be expanded from 15 to 25 seats , " said berthold meyer , professor for peace and conflict studies at germany 's university of marburg .
the idea is to make the body more geographically fair , explained otto keck , professor for international organizations at the university of potsdam .
" it would be desirable for every continent to be represented , " he said .
vying for seats but that 's easier said than done considering that no formal decisions have been made about the future division of seats or how they should be geographically allocated .
observers like keck believe the decision-making process surrounding the new seats will be a lengthy one . " it 's going to take a while , " he told dw-world .
" we 're not even at the stage yet where individual countries are in the running . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un headquarters in new york according to meyer , the two countries with the best chances are germany and japan , " afterall , they each contribute about 10 percent to the overall un budget . "
indeed , germany is the third-largest funder of the un .
lately , germany has been increasing its diplomatic campaign to win a seat .
just last week , germany and india signed a pact stating that the two countries would jointly promote the other 's efforts to gain a permanent seat .
and while in china , foreign minister joschka fischer sought to win over the support of the chinese government .
however , both experts expressed skepticism about the german government 's current approach .
during his visit with his chinese counterpart last week , fischer also broached the taboo issue of china 's human rights violations , a move that " does n't promote " germany 's campaign for a permanent seat - at least not in the eyes of beijing , meyer noted .
no seat for the eu building up the necessary support for a seat could prove an additional complication for germany .
developing nations are asking why a third rich eu country should be given a role on the security council , according to meyer . and recently a us diplomat told the british financial times that the us has serious concerns about germany getting a permanent seat .
it would also be possible , at least theoretically , for the european union to pursue a single seat in the security council instead of promoting an individual country .
but keck casts the idea aside .
" we ca n't count on the idea that , in the future , france and england would be willing to give up their positions in order to create a european seat , " he said .
meyer , too , said there 's too little unity within the eu for the creation of a single permanent seat in new york .

" there are still some things that remain unclear , " said keck , " voting rights , for example . "
will the members with permanent seats still have a veto right in the future , he asked ?
for his part , meyer said he thought the time frame for reform " would first open up after the us presidential election . "
it 's widely anticipated that a special commission of 16 former leaders convened by un general secretary kofi annan in november will submit proposals for a major un overhaul by the end of the year .
it could come up for a vote in the general assembly by 2005 .
even then , a modified un charter must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the general assembly , which includes some 190 nations . in the final step , the changes must also be ratified by the current security council members .
though officials in berlin have conceded to reporters that germany 's chances of gaining a permanent seat are limited , it has become a major thread in chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy strategy , with both schröder and fischer making increasingly strong remarks in recent months about germany 's desire for a seat .
france , russia and japan support the move , and in recent months schröder has sought to woo the united states and china .

" we have good signs of recovery , " said philippe camus , ceo of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .
boeing bets on smaller planes , more non-stops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer drawing of a boeing 7e7 dreamliner with the paint scheme of italy-based charter carrier blue panorama .
the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the outlook for the aviation market is once again improving .
" we have good signs of recovery , " said philippe camus , ceo of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
" passenger traffic is improving very rapidly . "
last year , airbus beat its american rival , boeing , on airplane deliveries for the first time in its history , providing 305 new airplanes to companies compared to chicago-based boeing 's 281 - a figure it could beat this year .
" we 're expecting to deliver more aircraft in 2004 than in 2003 , " camus said .
" we think it will continue in 2005 because we are seeing all the signs of a recovery . "
prospects are also improving for boeing .
" we 're expecting annual growth of 5.2 percent in our passenger business and 6.2 percent in freight services , " boeing commercial airplane boss alan mulally told reporters on monday .
boeing bets on smaller planes , more non-stops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer drawing of a boeing 7e7 dreamliner with the paint scheme of italy-based charter carrier blue panorama .
the plane will begin flying in 2008 .
boeing is expected to use the farnborough show to introduce its new 7e7 aircraft , a highly efficient model with which it hopes to put the brakes on the success of airbus 's a-330 aircraft .
the company says the mid-size 7e7 can fit up to 257 passengers and is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft in its class , offering the same range for long flights as larger aircraft .
boeing has confirmed orders for 62 7e7s , including 50 from all nippon airways and two from air new zealand .
thirty airlines have also asked boeing to submit proposals for outfitting them with the new model .
" the 7e7 has generated the most interest we have ever got early on when launching a new aircraft , " mulally told reporters .
in terms of the general market , boeing has estimated that there will be a demand during the next 20 years for 25,000 aircraft , worth a total of $ 2 trillion .
this week , the company announced it would hire 2,000-3,000 new employees , boeing 's first round of hiring since the terrorist attacks , after which is pared its total number of employees from 198,000 to 157,000 .
the attacks precipitated one of the worst crises in boeing 's history , with many airlines canceling , delaying or reducing plane orders .
in 2001 , the company was delivering 527 airplanes a year - nearly twice its current level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 aircraft will be able to carry 550 passengers whereas boeing is focusing on a new trend of non-stop , long-haul flights from second-tier regional airports , its european rival airbus is focusing on eliminating boeing 's dominance in the jumbo jet market .
airbus says its new a380 double-decker jumbo , set for introduction in 2006 , will help ease congestion at hub airports like frankfurt , london or paris .
airlines can squeeze as many as 555 passengers into an a380 compared to 400 in a boeing 747 , long the jumbo jet market leader .
boeing chief criticizes ' subsidies ' in an interview published in the welt am sonntag newspaper on sunday , boeing ceo harry stonecipher criticized what he described as " european subsidies " for airbus , and said he was convinced that the leaner 7e / was the right answer for future air traffic and not the enormous airbus a380 .
but airbus dismissed boeing 's complaints , saying they were will within the terms of an agreement thrashed out by us and european authorities in 1992 on launch aid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 cyprus celebrates a dubious birthday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a border still divides north and south cyprus thirty years after turkey invaded it , cyprus remains a divided island .
the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .
brussels thumbs its nose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the run-up to april 's referendum , turkish cypriots showed more enthusiasm for reunification and eu membership than their southern neighbors deeply angered , eu officials pledged to end decades long economic isolation of the island 's turkish denizens . the european commission has proposed providing a € 259 million economic aid package to the turkish cypriots .
brussels is also calling for the creation of a direct trade agreement that would allow northern cyprus to open up trade to the international community and to be given preferential treatment by brussels .
but there are even problems with that deal : as a full voting member , the greek cypriot government , which considers turkey to be an occupier of northern cyprus rather than a legitimate power , has threatened to sue the eu at the european court of justice if the aid is approved .
right of return still simmers other problems also persist , including property rights and the right-of-return for the former residents of the northern part of cyprus who were expelled in 1974 .
in addition , the greeks are still extremely wary of the 30,000-strong turkish military presence on the island .
but georg ziegler of the european commission 's cyprus task force said those fears are exaggerated .
" it 's now 2004 - and 1974 was a long time ago , " he said .
" now , turkey has candidate status for eu membership and negotiations could be opened this year , making it a breakthrough year for turkey .
when you consider the fact that turkey is standing before the eu 's door , on a pro-eu -lrb- political -rrb- course , you can see that , fundamentally , it 's unthinkable that its military would attack cyprus again . "
still , even though the border between the two sides has become more porous and the greek part of cyprus has become part of the eu , 30 years after the turkish invasion there is still no solution to the island 's division in sight .
the eu has more or less imported the problem and will have even greater difficulty trying to apply pressure to the greek cypriots now that the carrot-and-stick approach is no longer an option .
for the time being , the un has puts its negotiating efforts on ice . rainer sollich -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cyprus misses " an historic opportunity " world leaders reacted with disappointment and anger to greek cypriots ' rejection of a u.n. peace plan to reunite their island .
europe has vowed to help the long-isolated turkish north , which failed to get eu entry .
-lrb- april 25 , 2004 -rrb- eu hits greek cypriots in pocketbook after ' no ' vote angered by greek cypriots ' vote against reunification , eu foreign ministers pledge to help push the divided island 's turkish residents back into the international fold .

the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .

but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .

the greek side is now part of the eu , but the northern turkish half still suffers economic isolation despite un and brussels ' efforts to reunite it . though the greek portion of cyprus became a european union member after may 's " big bang " round of enlargement , the mediterranean island nation remains divided .
three decades after turkish troops invaded cyprus following a putsch attempt by former cypriot president archbishop makarios , who wanted the island to be annexed by greece , the question of responsibility still galvanizes .
the island 's turks insist greek cypriots were at fault because , for years , they tolerated attacks on the turkish minority , they tried to mount a coup and they wanted to annex the island as part of the greek mainland . meanwhile , the island 's greek majority accuse the turks of having used the putsch attempt as an excuse to expel close to 200,000 greeks from the northern half of the island as a manifestation of its desire to create an independent state on the island .
a diplomatic u-turn for years , the international community leaned towards the greek interpretation of events - for decades , it always seemed to be the turks who blocked the un 's efforts toward reunification .
but last year , the island 's turkish residents made a dramatic u-turn - a move motivated by the eu prospects for the isolated and economically undeveloped northern half of the island in the immediate term , and turkey 's own eu membership hopes in the future .
against this optimistic backdrop , un secretary general kofi annan developed a reunification plan that was put up for an april referendum on both sides .
the plan called for a relatively weak central government and strong greek and turkish bodies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriots hold signs reading " no " in greek during a gathering of the governing party in nicosia , cyprus on thursdsay , april 22 , 2004 .
the resulting vote is already history : 65 percent of turkish cypriots voted in favor of the plan .
but 76 percent of the island 's greeks voted against it , despite a decades-long push for reunification .
unlike the turkish cypriots , the greeks had nothing to lose : eu membership for the island 's greek half was already a done deal .
the results of the reunification referendum angered officials in brussels .
" i 'm going to say something totally undiplomatic , " eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen said at the time .
" i personally feel deceived by the government of the republic of cyprus . "
verheugen said he had worked for months to create the conditions for a " yes " vote by the greeks .

" however , it is becoming quite clear that such a solution is impossible as long as palestinian leader yasser arafat continues to exert his dire influence , " the london paper wrote .
it noted that since 1948 the tragedy of the palestinians has been the failure of their leaders to negotiate on a realistic basis .
" perhaps , the palestinians could learn from a history lesson , " the paper hoped .
the austrian paper der standard described the gaza strip as slipping into " anarchy . "
it said the situation resembled a " power struggle riding on a wave of anger over mismanagement . "
the spanish el pais regarded the past few days as ushering in the beginnings of the fight for arafat ’ s political death .
it wrote that this could be very short and is something which the negotiating peace partners such as israel , the united states and europe are secretly hoping for .
the french paper le croix commented that arafat is about to discourage a whole generation of impatient palestinians because of his handing out of important administration posts to old friends .
" a true head of state , " it said , " would have prepared a generation for change .
but with yasser arafat it looks as if it will all go backwards .
how can one persuade arafat that he can not continue in his leadership , " the paper pondered .
the swiss tages-anzeiger pointedly noted that the palestinians hungered and suffered under the israelis while their own political leaders drove around in air-conditioned sedans and decorated their bathrooms with italian marble funded by international aid money .
the genf-based paper observed that under the leadership of yassir arafat corruption and nepotism have become synonyms for authority .

a small tornado had just torn the roof off the ballet hall next door , throwing it into the theaters ' inner courtyard , police said .
just after 9 p.m. , the small tornado , with 120-kilometer per hour winds , wound its way through the cities of duisburg , oberhausen and essen .
the twister ripped roofs off buildings , it uprooted trees , overturned scores of cars and spectacularly , turned a 180-ton loading crane on its side in the duisburg harbor .
in the town of viersen , the tornado even sucked a 1-ton horse trailer 500 meters into the air like a toy .
the twister was part of a freak storm that wreaked havoc across parts of western europe on sunday night .
calls from people needing to have their flooded cellars pumped out and others seeking help overwhelmed emergency services , and police have estimated damages in the double-digit millions .

one of the country 's busiest rail lines , connecting frankfurt and cologne with neighboring belgium and france , had to do with just one track due to heavy flooding .
delays were expected to continue the whole day as clean up operations continued .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.07.2004 eu rules out central criminal register großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate was prompted by the confessions of killer fourniret eu justice and interior ministers agreed to step up information exchanges on national criminal records , but stopped short of creating a single criminal register for the entire 25-nation bloc . germany , france and spain all agreed they would speed up plans to share data on convicted criminals by electronically linking their national registers .
in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .
he added that this should also be the case if a criminal moves to a different european country .
" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .
germany , for example , said that it would be an infringement on national sovereignty . pietro petrucci , the eu commission spokesman , said he still hoped that a universal criminal register would be introduced .

the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .

" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .

in a statement , they said that the network could serve as a model for a future system linking all criminal registers in europe . the discussion over a common register of convicted murderers or sex offenders was sparked by the case of michel fourniret , a french forest warden who confessed to nine murders on both sides of the franco-belgian border .
the 62-year-old was given a job at a school in belgium despite a rape conviction in france because no one in belgium knew of his criminal record . despite the shock-waves caused by fourniret 's confessions , ministers at monday 's debate in brussels decided to cooperate better with existing national registers , rather than create a brand new eu register . the european commission is drafting proposals to boost information exchanges and has said it wants eu states to support plans to network national registers of serious offenders such as murderers and pedophiles . fourniret could have been stopped the fourniret case surfaced shortly after belgian marc dutroux was sentenced to life in prison for the abuse and murder of several young girls .
while the dutroux case highlighted embarrassing inefficiencies within the belgian police system , the fourniret case focused attention on the cooperation of european judicial systems across borders . some experts say the worst could have been prevented if french investigators had passed on more information about fourniret to their belgian counterparts : in the late 1980s , fourniret was convicted of raping minors and was sentenced to seven years in prison . he was only behind bars for a few months , but his criminal record was serious .
despite this , fourniret managed to get a job as a supervisor in a school kitchen after moving to belgium .
that 's horrifying proof that european law enforcement and judicial systems do n't cooperate well , according to " childfocus , " a belgian organization that searches for missing children . " it 's not normal , that france did n't keep investigating fourniret after his release , " said isabelle marneffe , the organization 's spokeswoman .
" france did n't warn her european partners .
that 's why someone with a criminal record in a neighboring country was able to obtain a clean record in belgium .
something 's clearly wrong here . " records do n't cross borders currently , law enforcement officers are not required to pass on information about released criminals to neighboring countries unless the latter specifically request this . on the other hand , there is no law requiring prosecutors to acquire information from other countries if a suspect used to reside there .
in other words : criminal records do n't cross european borders . " i believe that you have to keep records of previous crimes for much longer in order to be truly effective in combating sexual offenses , " said cedric visart de bocarme , the man charged with prosecuting fourniret .
he added that this should also be the case if a criminal moves to a different european country .
" it would help investigations tremendously if international cooperation would be better organized . " national sovereignty at issue prior to monday 's debate , several countries voiced their concern over such a central register .
germany , for example , said that it would be an infringement on national sovereignty . pietro petrucci , the eu commission spokesman , said he still hoped that a universal criminal register would be introduced .

the association of london government 's -lrb- alg -rrb- local authorities act will give them more powers to clamp down on anti-social behaviour from monday .
the powers also target fly-posting , ticket touts and graffiti .
neighbours could be fined for breaching noise abatement notices and companies could be prosecuted for fly-posting .
' valuable asset ' owners of bridges will be told to take action to stop pigeons nesting in them and shop owners will have to pay to remove graffiti on their walls .
boroughs also have the power to dispose of unregistered or untaxed cars immediately and to stop car repair firms carrying out work in the street .
chair of the alg sir robin wales said : " these new powers will be a valuable asset in the fight against the anti-social problems blighting people 's lives .
" londoners constantly tell us that noisy neighbours , graffiti and abandoned vehicles are among the issues that most concern them , and their views have helped shape this act .
" the clear and simple message to people committing this type of anti-social behaviour is that it will not be tolerated and we will do all we can to prevent them spoiling the quality of life for others members of the community . "

by clare murphy bbc news online less than a decade ago , a book by an american historian which declared that the holocaust was possible because germans had a congenital urge to kill jews shot to the top of the bestseller list in germany .
stauffenberg led a failed coup attempt against hitler daniel goldhagen , author of hitler 's willing executioners : ordinary germans and the holocaust , was awarded the country 's prestigious democracy prize in 1997 .
the honour had last been bestowed upon east german activists who helped precipitate the fall of the berlin wall .
despite being lambasted by many historians of the third reich as simplistic and subjective , the " non-book " - as one dubbed it - was grabbed from the shelves by a generation of germans who embraced the notion of collective guilt on a scale never suggested before .
but it appears germany has left at least some of that 20th century burden of guilt behind in the last millennium .
this year , the 60th anniversary of an attempted coup against hitler by a group of military officers has provided the occasion for a rather sunnier perspective on the past , offering up courageous figures whom the country can celebrate rather than castigate .
click to see where the bomb was planted and who was hurt " germans ca n't go on forever feeling nothing but guilt - it 's not possible , " says prominent german journalist henryk broder .
" we had the protestations of utter innocence immediately after the war , then the all-consuming guilt .
it 's time for something different - it 's perfectly natural to want to start highlighting the positive . "
renaissance claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who on 20 july 1944 placed a bomb under hitler 's table which killed four but left the fuehrer alive , has not always been a post-war darling .
after the capitulation , the allegedly amateurish way in which his attempt on hitler 's life was carried out came in for attack .
later his motives came in for scrutiny - stauffenberg , some left-wing historians asserted , had distinctly authoritarian tendencies .
now the aristocratic colonel is widely accepted to have acted heroically and has become the subject of a string of films and documentaries to mark the 60th anniversary of the attempt on hitler 's life .
on the day itself , chancellor gerhard schroeder will lay a wreath at the spot where stauffenberg and his fellow conspirators were executed .
their story was first dramatised on the television as " stauffenberg " in february .
stauffenberg 's life 1907 : born in jettingen 1926 : joins army 1939/40 : fights in poland & france turns hostile to policy towards jews and slavs 1943 : decides hitler must go 1944 : plants bomb at nazi hq coup fails and he is executed with echoes of the goldhagen divide , the critics objected to what they saw as its simplistic good versus evil premise while the audience lapped it up ; the film topped prime-time ratings with a 23 % audience share .
stauffenberg is not the only resistance figure to receive fresh cinematic treatment .
work has also just started on a film about the last days of sophie scholl , the 21-year-old student who was executed along with her brother hans for distributing anti-nazi leaflets at munich university .
indeed film is the medium where germany is increasingly practicing a new relationship with its past , according to the critics .
even before their release , two new films in which adolf hitler is placed centre-screen have been held up as evidence that germany is moving out of the fuehrer 's shadow .
" the fact that we now trust ourselves to play hitler - when in film he has always been on the sidelines - is definitely a big step , " says film critic carlos gerstenhauer .
" it 's a generational thing - the distance is there now to enable us to do this . "
living the legacy but for all the discussion of a new epoch , germany 's fear of its nazi past continues to have an impact upon its present at a number of levels .
mein kampf is not available in german bookshops the shadow of nazi-era eugenics in germany has created some of the west 's most restrictive fertility legislation , a top german scientist recently noted - legislation which in some cases can put the lives of both mother and baby at risk .
while germany 's eu neighbours are increasingly offering restive electorates referendums on controversial issues like the european constitution , plebiscites - because of the way they were used by hitler - are banned in the country .
as is his manifesto - mein kampf , which is freely available in bookshops outside the country .
a call earlier this year by german jewish author rafael seligmann to lift the restriction met both ridicule and fury .
" at the heart of all this lies the fact that we still can not trust each other , " says mr seligmann .
" and we worry so much that the world may point their fingers at us and say look - those germans are up to the same old thing again . "
the german interior minister is currently drafting legislation to restrict the rights of neo-nazis to congregate - in anticipation of possible demonstrations when the holocaust memorial opens next may in berlin .
while existing legislation enables the authorities to ban demonstrations which threaten public safety , under these proposals , the political orientation of a gathering would be sufficient grounds to stop it .
the plans have promoted some unease ; some have questioned whether such bans are the best way to deal with fringe groups , the occasional voice has even drawn parallels with laws from the first half of the last century designed to quell opposition .
" the right to demonstrate is of course an important one in a democracy , " says henryk broder .
" but you ca n't have neo-nazis marching through the brandenburg gate .
" what would it look like ? "

despite being lambasted by many historians of the third reich as simplistic and subjective , the " non-book " - as one dubbed it - was grabbed from the shelves by a generation of germans who embraced the notion of collective guilt on a scale never suggested before .

by clare murphy bbc news online less than a decade ago , a book by an american historian which declared that the holocaust was possible because germans had a congenital urge to kill jews shot to the top of the bestseller list in germany .

the as-yet untitled film is based on a book written by his widow , deborah .

he suffered from epilepsy , which caused problems when performing on stage with strobe lights , and hanged himself in 1980 .
manchester-based production former manager and friend , factory records boss tony wilson , said : " he was two people in that there was the very intense person .

curtis killed himself in 1980 just as the legendary and inspirational manchester band were on the cusp of commercial success .
the as-yet untitled film is based on a book written by his widow , deborah .
producer todd eckart said : " we are speaking with an actor who is huge and who looks rather a lot like ian . "
he added : " he has just finished a couple of films in which the only thing he listened to was joy division and new order -lsb- the band which the band mates formed after curtis ' death -rsb- .
todd eckert says a major film star is considering playing the role " should this guy ultimately agree that he is going to play ian , it would make it a much bigger film .
" ian curtis is one of the most important figures in the history of music . "
deborah curtis 's book , touching from a distance , paints a picture of her husband as a gifted but tortured man who was also prone to jealousy and manipulation .
he suffered from epilepsy , which caused problems when performing on stage with strobe lights , and hanged himself in 1980 .
manchester-based production former manager and friend , factory records boss tony wilson , said : " he was two people in that there was the very intense person .
" but also there was the character whose head poked out of a fourth storey window in london one night while the rest of his band were raining eggs and flower and water on me and my group .
