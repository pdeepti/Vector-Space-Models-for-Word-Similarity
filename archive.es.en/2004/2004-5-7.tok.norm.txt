program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.05.2004 report : nato , un workers fuel kosovo sex trade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops in kosovo are apparently frequent supporters of the sex industry .
amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

u.s president george bush is expected to visit u.s troops serving in peacekeeping mission in kosovo on july 24 , 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / visar kryeziu -rrb- has an international contingent of more than 17,500 troops -lrb- kfor -rrb- patrolling the country , and the large majority of the rest works for the united nations mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- . from 2002 until july 2003 , amnesty reported that up to 27 kfor soldiers were suspected of offenses related to the sex trade . unmik said 10 of their police officers had been dismissed on similar charges in 2003 . nato , un : report outdated , unbalanced but the two institutions criticized the report as unbalanced .
a nato spokesman said that some accusations seemed out of date and said that each country was responsible for the conduct of their soldiers .
the united nations said in a statement that the report was outdated and drew " heavily on conditions existing in 1999-2001 , when the un mission in kosovo was at the incipient stage . " " outdated information from that period is extrapolated on and presented as current , " the statement continued . germany not aware of any investigations the german defense ministry , which has 3,600 soldiers as part of the nato mission in kosovo , said it had yet to read the report .
in 1999 and 2000 , german soldiers were accused of visiting underage sex workers , according to reports and a defense ministry spokesman .
but the spokesman told dw-world that the ministry found no wrong doing .
he said he was not aware of any current investigations . " there are very clear taboos for german soldiers , " the spokesman said , adding that soldiers are restricted to living on military bases .
" there is legal consequences if a soldier ignores them .
that is made very clear in training . " the un said that it too had implemented tough punishment for violators as early as 2001 , setting up a trafficking and prostitution investigation unit to work together with police and women 's advocacy groups .
amnesty says more needs to be done , including guaranteeing victims redress and reparation and setting up some sort of witness protection program for the women . " trafficking of women and girls in kosovo and other post-conflict situations will never end as long as the perpetrators go free , " said the organization .
" and as long as civilian and military personnel are allowed to commit human rights violations with impunity .

amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

a nato spokesman said that some accusations seemed out of date and said that each country was responsible for the conduct of their soldiers .

amnesty says more needs to be done , including guaranteeing victims redress and reparation and setting up some sort of witness protection program for the women .

" the israeli government 's position is that it supports the road map .
we support the road map .
everyone supports the road map , " said cowen .
" now could we please have some activation on the road map and implementation and some good will demonstrated and not allow the enemies of peace to dictate the agenda process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom unlike the united states , however , the european union plays a secondary role in middle east peace mediation , something acknowledged by israeli foreign minister silvan shalom -lrb- photo -rrb- .
shalom attacked the eu behind closed doors , saying the bloc often sided with the palestinians . following prime minister ariel sharon 's failed attempt to get his likud party to appove his plan to withdraw from the gaza strip , shalom said the party would alter the plan accordingly . despite the fact that the palestinian chief negotiator refused to meet his israeli counterpart for discussions , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the meeting was a success .
the european union was able to hear both the opinions of both arab states and the israelis on the conflict . partnership a success eu foreign policy chief javier solana praised the partnership between europe and the mediterranean countries , which started in 1995 . " even despite the difficulties that in that region continue to take place … we have been able to continue working together and doing things which are very beneficial for the countries of this region , " solana said . slow progress was being made to support economic and political reforms , and that the long-term aim remained establishing a free trade zone around the mediterranean in 2010 , eu diplomats said .
the eu already has such an agreement with algeria , morocco , tunisia and jordan .
altogether , the european union and the european investment bank provide € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- for cultural work , educational exchanges and training and reform programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " it 's not a question of whether enough comes back .
instead it 's an investment in stability , " said fischer .
" the central question for european security in the 21st century is whether the mediterranean will become a sea of cooperation or confrontation .
that is not only for the mediterranean states of the eu , but for all of us , of paramount importance . " not too busy for the south eu foreign policy commissioner chris patten countered accusations that the eu was too occupied with its own expansion from 10 to 25 states to look southward . he said the eu-med program " enables us to focus more on ways in which people help those countries which wish … to share much more fully in our market and in the way we do things in the union .
it 's a direct rebuttal of the proposition that enlargement of the european union would lead to a ' fortress europe ' . " besides libya , all north african states are part of the eu-mediterranean program .
but since libyan leader muammar gadhafi 's visit to brussels in late april , the chances have improved for the country , which had observer status at the dublin talks , to be integrated into the eu 's program .

" the israeli government 's position is that it supports the road map .
we support the road map .
everyone supports the road map , " said cowen .
" now could we please have some activation on the road map and implementation and some good will demonstrated and not allow the enemies of peace to dictate the agenda process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom unlike the united states , however , the european union plays a secondary role in middle east peace mediation , something acknowledged by israeli foreign minister silvan shalom -lrb- photo -rrb- .
shalom attacked the eu behind closed doors , saying the bloc often sided with the palestinians . following prime minister ariel sharon 's failed attempt to get his likud party to appove his plan to withdraw from the gaza strip , shalom said the party would alter the plan accordingly . despite the fact that the palestinian chief negotiator refused to meet his israeli counterpart for discussions , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the meeting was a success .
the european union was able to hear both the opinions of both arab states and the israelis on the conflict . partnership a success eu foreign policy chief javier solana praised the partnership between europe and the mediterranean countries , which started in 1995 . " even despite the difficulties that in that region continue to take place … we have been able to continue working together and doing things which are very beneficial for the countries of this region , " solana said . slow progress was being made to support economic and political reforms , and that the long-term aim remained establishing a free trade zone around the mediterranean in 2010 , eu diplomats said .
the eu already has such an agreement with algeria , morocco , tunisia and jordan .
altogether , the european union and the european investment bank provide € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- for cultural work , educational exchanges and training and reform programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " it 's not a question of whether enough comes back .
instead it 's an investment in stability , " said fischer .
" the central question for european security in the 21st century is whether the mediterranean will become a sea of cooperation or confrontation .
that is not only for the mediterranean states of the eu , but for all of us , of paramount importance . " not too busy for the south eu foreign policy commissioner chris patten countered accusations that the eu was too occupied with its own expansion from 10 to 25 states to look southward . he said the eu-med program " enables us to focus more on ways in which people help those countries which wish … to share much more fully in our market and in the way we do things in the union .
it 's a direct rebuttal of the proposition that enlargement of the european union would lead to a ' fortress europe ' . " besides libya , all north african states are part of the eu-mediterranean program .
but since libyan leader muammar gadhafi 's visit to brussels in late april , the chances have improved for the country , which had observer status at the dublin talks , to be integrated into the eu 's program . " we aim to become a full member , but that will still take come time and agreement in our own bodies , " libyan foreign minister mohammed abdul rahman shalgan said . however , since a libyan court sentenced bulgarian doctors to death this week for allegedly infecting children with the hiv virus , relations have been put on ice .
but cowen made clear that change will only come if the sentence is rescinded and a solution is found . berndt riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe-med forum to push for middle east ceasefire stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday .

it was n't that the fans were surprised that their team made it to the finals .
the eisbären had been riding high all season thanks to a line-up of experienced foreign players and young german talent .
but national success is still relatively new for the former east german team .
today , it 's one of the few sports teams from the old gdr that 's risen to the top of the league in reunified germany .
in recent years , the eisbären have even outplayed the west berlin team , the berlin capitals . " it ’ s really something that the eisbären are doing so well now , " local sports journalist klaus weiser told dw-world .
" they ’ re a bit of a cult team , with a long tradition , they ’ ve always been really popular in east berlin .
they were the east german champions 15 times , and after reunification when they played nationally with western teams , they were among the worst , always at the bottom .
but the stadium was always full , and the fans have always been behind them . ” champions of world 's smallest league it ’ s true that the eisbären were at the top of their league in east germany .

german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .
skilled employees and tomorrow 's experts " do n't just fall from heaven , " said germany 's social democratic education minister edelgard bulmahn -lrb- right -rrb- before friday 's debate and vote in the bundestag . " they must be trained , " she said . the vote passed 300-284 in parliament and does not need approval of the opposition-controlled upper house . the government has been critical of companies that are able of offering traineeships , but do not .
last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines . " we are locked into fragile economic times and issuing threats is n't going to improve the climate for hiring , " martin wansleben , managing director of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told reporters .
" this law is disastrous . " opposition politicians were no more supportive .
guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation . " " this is not a good day for vocational training in germany , " he told the ddp news agency . business or young people first ? but green party parliamentarian grietje bettin criticized opposition politicians for only looking out for the interests of the business community and ignoring the needs of young people in need of training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she said the fine should not be seen as a penalty , but rather as a fair and socially just method to create a balance between companies that do train and those that do not . nicolette kressl of the spd responded to opposition criticism by saying politicians from those parties had not suggested any alternative measures to increase the overall number of traineeships on offer . the move to pass some kind of legislation gained momentum last year , when 35,000 people who sought traineeships failed to find one .
there were 182,000 apprenticeships in total last month , about 27,000 lower than the year before , according to germany 's federal labor agency . in a survey carried out by the university of dortmund , 42 percent of german parents asked said they worried that their child would not find " an appropriate traineeship " after leaving school , up from 32 percent a decade ago .
in the eastern part of germany , 24 percent were against the imposition of fines on companies which did not sufficiently train .

" the political damage for the usa is so immense , " writes munich 's süddeutsche zeitung , " that even the resignation of donald rumsfeld wo n't even things out . "
but a political victim would send a particularly believable sign that the american government takes seriously its own moral assertions and values that it tries to hold up in iraq .
the paper suggests donald rumsfeld 's resignation would be a sign of humility that has been sorely lacking in him for too long .

" that the president in front of arabic television could not even bring himself to say sorry is disgraceful . "

" this has n't just happened out of the blue , " writes the aachener nachrichten .
" why , then , has the bush administration been so willing to hand over al qaeda suspects captured in afghanistan to other countries ?
the answer is quite simply because their more vigorous interrogation methods will see results .

u.s. president george w bush has reacted with shock at the images of torture in iraqi prisons by american soldiers .
but adds the paper , " the question remains whether it 's the torture itself that disturbs the president or the images of the torture ? "
the financial times deutschland writes that the accusations of torture against u.s. soldiers has grown to a barely containable foreign policy issue for the white house and notes that half a year before the presidential elections the topic of iraq is again the central issue .
but the paper doubts that the presidential candidate john kerry will be able to utilize this scandal to his advantage .
the paper believes president bush 's interview on arabic television was designed for an american audience to show he was taking responsibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.05.2004 postbank ipo could provide spark to german stock market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setting sail towards a successful future on the stock market .
deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .
but will the news revive germany 's flagging shareholder culture ? stock market enthusiasts have reason to hope again .
the head of postbank , wulf von schimmelmann , and the executive chairman of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , have big things planned . on june 21 , postbank goes public .
with its clear position as a private bank and a low-risk business model , the credit institute is " fit for the stock market , " said zumwinkel . postbank plans to list up to 50 percent of its equity capital minus one share on the german stock exchange - meaning that deutsche post will remain the majority shareholder .
a price range for the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
experts are already speculating on a price of € 30 per share .
proceeds of about € 3 billion should flow into deutsche post 's coffers as a result of the listing .
the company said it plans to use the money on a stratetgic expansion - among the countries mentioned were austria and denmark .
prognosis positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is the largest private bank in germany .
at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .
and with good reason .
postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .
" the savings deposits alone have climbed by € 1.6 billion , " he said , adding that , last year , the bank managed to triple its net profits in comparison with the previous year .
all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .
shortly before the postbank ipo was announced , the financial times deutschland reported that deutsche bank was aiming for a complete takeover of postbank , and that there 'd already been discussions to that effect with the government .
zumwinkel denies the rumours , though , saying deutsche post intends to be the majority shareholder for the long run . arend wulff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post looks abroad driven by aggressive international expansion , deutsche post reported a profit in 2003 .

the damage done by this behavior is enormous , the paper wrote .
the scandal for the rest of the world confirms that the united states has taken on more than it can handle in iraq .
the paper said george w. bush will have to make a sacrifice in washington and the most prominent victim could be the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld . italy ’ s corriere della sera agreed , but added that there is more than rumsfeld ’ s scalp at stake .
the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .

the damage done by this behavior is enormous , the paper wrote .
the scandal for the rest of the world confirms that the united states has taken on more than it can handle in iraq .
the paper said george w. bush will have to make a sacrifice in washington and the most prominent victim could be the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld . italy ’ s corriere della sera agreed , but added that there is more than rumsfeld ’ s scalp at stake .
the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.05.2004 german politics captivates theater-goers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " democracy " in berlin : east german spy guillaume whispers in chancellor brandt 's ear michael frayn pays tribute to late german chancellor willy brandt in the play " democracy . "
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .

when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .

deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .
but will the news revive germany 's flagging shareholder culture ? stock market enthusiasts have reason to hope again .
the head of postbank , wulf von schimmelmann , and the executive chairman of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , have big things planned . on june 21 , postbank goes public .
with its clear position as a private bank and a low-risk business model , the credit institute is " fit for the stock market , " said zumwinkel . postbank plans to list up to 50 percent of its equity capital minus one share on the german stock exchange - meaning that deutsche post will remain the majority shareholder .
a price range for the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
experts are already speculating on a price of € 30 per share .
proceeds of about € 3 billion should flow into deutsche post 's coffers as a result of the listing .
the company said it plans to use the money on a stratetgic expansion - among the countries mentioned were austria and denmark .
prognosis positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is the largest private bank in germany .
at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .
and with good reason .
postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .
" the savings deposits alone have climbed by € 1.6 billion , " he said , adding that , last year , the bank managed to triple its net profits in comparison with the previous year .
all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .
shortly before the postbank ipo was announced , the financial times deutschland reported that deutsche bank was aiming for a complete takeover of postbank , and that there 'd already been discussions to that effect with the government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.05.2004 fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 7.3 million foreigners have already made germany their home .
the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details . four days after the green party pulled out of crucial immigration talks with the conservative opposition - prompting talk of a government crisis - germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens have agreed to bury differences and search for common ground on continuing negotiations . following a government summit meeting in chancellor schröder 's office on friday , representatives from the two parties said they had reached a compromise , according to which the chancellor will hold special meetings with the conservative opposition of christian democrats and its sister party , the christian social union , to determine whether there were any chances for a all-party accord on a new immigration law . but , in the end it would be up to a government committee to decide whether immigration negotiations with the conservative opposition should continue .
the new immigration law is in effect designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and facilitate companies to recruit skilled staff from abroad . the government summit meeting on friday agreed on a declaration in which they accused the opposition christian democrats of blocking talks thus far .
the declaration also stressed that to avoid the immigration law from " becoming an instrument in election campaigns , " the decision on further talks would be taken before the european elections on june 13 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader reinhard bütikofer spd chairman franz müntefering said on friday , " a common law is the priority . " green party chief reinhard bütikofer -lrb- photo -rrb- emphasized that it was important that further negotiations with the opposition were marked by a " clear timetable " and a " clear alternative . " conservatives make security issue a priority the latest crisis in the immigration debate came after the greens abandoned talks on monday , saying the conservative opposition was hell-bent on including anti-terrorism measures in the immigration package - a move the greens believe has nothing to do with immigration directly and was blocking all other issues . " we do n't believe that we can come to a responsible solution with the christian democrats , " bütikofer told daily tagesspiegel on thursday . the christian democrats insist - in light of the recent terrorist attacks in madrid - that an accord on the immigration law hinges on reaching agreement on important internal security issues .
the conservatives want a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and participate in violent demonstrations as well as the expulsion of persons who preach hate and violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , they want to deport foreigners sentenced to more than a year in prison , set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . government might go it alone schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . but in light of pressure from business and industry keen to hire skilled personnel from abroad and germany 's rapidly ageing population that needs young workers to keep the social services from collapsing , the government has indicated that it might go it alone with the immigration law if the conservatives do n't fall in line . it would thus seek parliamentary approval for clauses in the immigration law that do n't need the support of the opposition-dominated upper house , which represents germany 's federal states . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens abandon german immigration talks germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .

german politicians say berlin missed a great chance at publicity after the parliament refused to allow hollywood star tom cruise to shoot " mission impossible 3 " in berlin 's historic reichstag building . a month after tom cruise arrived in berlin to check out possible locations for the third part of his spy thriller " mission impossible " - the hollywood hunk has been given the cold shoulder by the german parliament . cruise was apparently fascinated by the reichstag 's spectacular glass dome and wanted to shoot there .
but the idea of a hollywood crew trampling through the hallowed corridors of the seat of german democracy was , it seems , too much for parliamentary president wolfgang thierse to bear . earlier this week , he shot down cruise 's wish .

the parliamentarians said germany had missed a chance to raise its international profile .
" it 's great if such films do n't just play against the backdrop of los angeles or new york , but also in berlin or paris , " greens deputy floor leader volker beck said .

" president of berlin 's city-state parliament , walter momper insisted that cruise could still film in berlin and offered his own office , the former prussian assembly building , as an alternative location .
" mr cruise should show us the screenplay , and if it fits with the dignity of the building , then he can film here by paying a small fee , " momper told daily berliner kurier . but , as it turns out , the outcry may be hugely overestimating what 's at stake .
a source at the babelsberg film studios near potsdam told news magazine spiegel that all director joe carnahan wanted was to " shoot a really simple dialogue scene in the dome of the reichstag , " not a sophisticated one with special effects and the works . babelsberg spokesman felix neunzerling too added it was n't a big deal .

big european mobile phone carriers are now facing a headache big airlines have already confronted : low-cost competition .
the mobile phone equivalents of ryanair and easyjet are promising to shake up the market . it was probably only a question of time until some enterprising businessperson saw the possibilities in emulating the successful model of the low-cost air carriers .
while ryanair , german wings and hapag-lloyd have undercut the giants of the aviation industry and forced them to radically reevaluate how they do business , mobile phone upstarts like denmark 's telmore are doing the same in its own sector . after years of growth , the european mobile phone market is saturated , since already 80 percent of europeans already own mobile phones .
mobile phone service providers can not count on basing future business strategies on winning new customers .
they are n't there to be had . " in the next few years , a segmentation of the market is going to take place , similar to what we 've seen with the airlines , " roman friedrich , telecoms analyst at the consulting firm booz allen hamilton deutschland , told dw-world .
he said according to studies his firm has carried out , the european mobile phone market is standing just before a turning point . " by the end of the year in europe there will several low-cost providers and in two years at the most , in almost every country there will be at least one big low-cost operator , " he said . up to 60 percent cheaper it 's likely that low-cost mobile phone providers will find the same enthusiastic reception as europe 's low-cost air carriers have .
friedrich estimates that up to 20 percent of mobile phone users could switch to low-cost carriers . for those who use their mobile phones for just telephoning and have little interest in high-tech extras or service hotlines , low-cost providers are an attractive alternative .
prices can run from 30 to 40 percent under those charged by the big carriers , or in some cases , up to 60 percent . those however who put value on having the newest , sleekest phone on the market in their purse or pocket and want to play games , get news , or download music and videos will be disappointed .
the low-cost players , according to friedrich , dispense with anything that involves higher operating expenses or development costs . danish success several danish low-cost firms , telmore and cbb mobil , have managed to give big carriers a few sleepless nights with their success .
the two have acquired 43.7 percent of all new mobile customers from 2000 to 2003 .
today , more than 20 percent of mobile customers are using a discount mobile service provider . the developments in denmark have led the mobile phone providers across europe , even in countries without low-cost players , to consider what their future strategies should be .
some are considering offering their own inexpensive plans or creating subsidiaries to try to beat the arrival of the low-cost competition - an event that the big firms say is a given . " after telmore several companies , such as tele.ring in austria and sunrise in switzerland as good candidates for restructuring into low-cost carriers , " said friedrich .
" in sweden and the netherlands there are several companies currently in the starting blocks . " in germany , new providers are sure to mix up the mobile telephony landscape .
the current market structure , two large and two small providers , is considered by the sector to be unstable and nearly predestined for the entry of one or more low-cost carriers .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .

" copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .
-lrb- march 25 , 2004 -rrb- " rosewood " spy files open for researchers journalists and historians may now access the so-called rosewood files , documents about west german spies who worked for the east german secret police , the stasi .
-lrb- march 19 , 2003 -rrb- turkish " fly catchers " in the stasi 's service the agency administering the files of the former east german secret police has uncovered a little-known chapter in the history of germany 's immigrant guest workers : some served as spies for the stasi .

the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details . four days after the green party pulled out of crucial immigration talks with the conservative opposition - prompting talk of a government crisis - germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens have agreed to bury differences and search for common ground on continuing negotiations . following a government summit meeting in chancellor schröder 's office on friday , representatives from the two parties said they had reached a compromise , according to which the chancellor will hold special meetings with the conservative opposition of christian democrats and its sister party , the christian social union , to determine whether there were any chances for a all-party accord on a new immigration law . but , in the end it would be up to a government committee to decide whether immigration negotiations with the conservative opposition should continue .
the new immigration law is in effect designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and facilitate companies to recruit skilled staff from abroad . the government summit meeting on friday agreed on a declaration in which they accused the opposition christian democrats of blocking talks thus far .
the declaration also stressed that to avoid the immigration law from " becoming an instrument in election campaigns , " the decision on further talks would be taken before the european elections on june 13 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader reinhard bütikofer spd chairman franz müntefering said on friday , " a common law is the priority . " green party chief reinhard bütikofer -lrb- photo -rrb- emphasized that it was important that further negotiations with the opposition were marked by a " clear timetable " and a " clear alternative . " conservatives make security issue a priority the latest crisis in the immigration debate came after the greens abandoned talks on monday , saying the conservative opposition was hell-bent on including anti-terrorism measures in the immigration package - a move the greens believe has nothing to do with immigration directly and was blocking all other issues . " we do n't believe that we can come to a responsible solution with the christian democrats , " bütikofer told daily tagesspiegel on thursday . the christian democrats insist - in light of the recent terrorist attacks in madrid - that an accord on the immigration law hinges on reaching agreement on important internal security issues .

chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details . four days after the green party pulled out of crucial immigration talks with the conservative opposition - prompting talk of a government crisis - germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens have agreed to bury differences and search for common ground on continuing negotiations . following a government summit meeting in chancellor schröder 's office on friday , representatives from the two parties said they had reached a compromise , according to which the chancellor will hold special meetings with the conservative opposition of christian democrats and its sister party , the christian social union , to determine whether there were any chances for a all-party accord on a new immigration law . but , in the end it would be up to a government committee to decide whether immigration negotiations with the conservative opposition should continue .
the new immigration law is in effect designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and facilitate companies to recruit skilled staff from abroad . the government summit meeting on friday agreed on a declaration in which they accused the opposition christian democrats of blocking talks thus far .
the declaration also stressed that to avoid the immigration law from " becoming an instrument in election campaigns , " the decision on further talks would be taken before the european elections on june 13 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader reinhard bütikofer spd chairman franz müntefering said on friday , " a common law is the priority . " green party chief reinhard bütikofer -lrb- photo -rrb- emphasized that it was important that further negotiations with the opposition were marked by a " clear timetable " and a " clear alternative . " conservatives make security issue a priority the latest crisis in the immigration debate came after the greens abandoned talks on monday , saying the conservative opposition was hell-bent on including anti-terrorism measures in the immigration package - a move the greens believe has nothing to do with immigration directly and was blocking all other issues . " we do n't believe that we can come to a responsible solution with the christian democrats , " bütikofer told daily tagesspiegel on thursday . the christian democrats insist - in light of the recent terrorist attacks in madrid - that an accord on the immigration law hinges on reaching agreement on important internal security issues .
the conservatives want a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and participate in violent demonstrations as well as the expulsion of persons who preach hate and violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , they want to deport foreigners sentenced to more than a year in prison , set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . government might go it alone schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . but in light of pressure from business and industry keen to hire skilled personnel from abroad and germany 's rapidly ageing population that needs young workers to keep the social services from collapsing , the government has indicated that it might go it alone with the immigration law if the conservatives do n't fall in line . it would thus seek parliamentary approval for clauses in the immigration law that do n't need the support of the opposition-dominated upper house , which represents germany 's federal states . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens abandon german immigration talks germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .

deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .
but will the news revive germany 's flagging shareholder culture ? stock market enthusiasts have reason to hope again .
the head of postbank , wulf von schimmelmann , and the executive chairman of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , have big things planned . on june 21 , postbank goes public .
with its clear position as a private bank and a low-risk business model , the credit institute is " fit for the stock market , " said zumwinkel . postbank plans to list up to 50 percent of its equity capital minus one share on the german stock exchange - meaning that deutsche post will remain the majority shareholder .
a price range for the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
experts are already speculating on a price of € 30 per share .
proceeds of about € 3 billion should flow into deutsche post 's coffers as a result of the listing .
the company said it plans to use the money on a stratetgic expansion - among the countries mentioned were austria and denmark .
prognosis positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is the largest private bank in germany .
at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .
and with good reason .
postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .
" the savings deposits alone have climbed by € 1.6 billion , " he said , adding that , last year , the bank managed to triple its net profits in comparison with the previous year .
all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .
shortly before the postbank ipo was announced , the financial times deutschland reported that deutsche bank was aiming for a complete takeover of postbank , and that there 'd already been discussions to that effect with the government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.05.2004 postbank ipo could provide spark to german stock market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setting sail towards a successful future on the stock market .
deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .
but will the news revive germany 's flagging shareholder culture ? stock market enthusiasts have reason to hope again .
the head of postbank , wulf von schimmelmann , and the executive chairman of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , have big things planned . on june 21 , postbank goes public .
with its clear position as a private bank and a low-risk business model , the credit institute is " fit for the stock market , " said zumwinkel . postbank plans to list up to 50 percent of its equity capital minus one share on the german stock exchange - meaning that deutsche post will remain the majority shareholder .
a price range for the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
experts are already speculating on a price of € 30 per share .
proceeds of about € 3 billion should flow into deutsche post 's coffers as a result of the listing .
the company said it plans to use the money on a stratetgic expansion - among the countries mentioned were austria and denmark .
prognosis positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is the largest private bank in germany .
at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .
and with good reason .
postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .
" the savings deposits alone have climbed by € 1.6 billion , " he said , adding that , last year , the bank managed to triple its net profits in comparison with the previous year .
all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .
shortly before the postbank ipo was announced , the financial times deutschland reported that deutsche bank was aiming for a complete takeover of postbank , and that there 'd already been discussions to that effect with the government .
zumwinkel denies the rumours , though , saying deutsche post intends to be the majority shareholder for the long run . arend wulff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post looks abroad driven by aggressive international expansion , deutsche post reported a profit in 2003 .

big european mobile phone carriers are now facing a headache big airlines have already confronted : low-cost competition .
the mobile phone equivalents of ryanair and easyjet are promising to shake up the market . it was probably only a question of time until some enterprising businessperson saw the possibilities in emulating the successful model of the low-cost air carriers .
while ryanair , german wings and hapag-lloyd have undercut the giants of the aviation industry and forced them to radically reevaluate how they do business , mobile phone upstarts like denmark 's telmore are doing the same in its own sector . after years of growth , the european mobile phone market is saturated , since already 80 percent of europeans already own mobile phones .
mobile phone service providers can not count on basing future business strategies on winning new customers .
they are n't there to be had . " in the next few years , a segmentation of the market is going to take place , similar to what we 've seen with the airlines , " roman friedrich , telecoms analyst at the consulting firm booz allen hamilton deutschland , told dw-world .
he said according to studies his firm has carried out , the european mobile phone market is standing just before a turning point . " by the end of the year in europe there will several low-cost providers and in two years at the most , in almost every country there will be at least one big low-cost operator , " he said . up to 60 percent cheaper it 's likely that low-cost mobile phone providers will find the same enthusiastic reception as europe 's low-cost air carriers have .
friedrich estimates that up to 20 percent of mobile phone users could switch to low-cost carriers . for those who use their mobile phones for just telephoning and have little interest in high-tech extras or service hotlines , low-cost providers are an attractive alternative .
prices can run from 30 to 40 percent under those charged by the big carriers , or in some cases , up to 60 percent . those however who put value on having the newest , sleekest phone on the market in their purse or pocket and want to play games , get news , or download music and videos will be disappointed .
the low-cost players , according to friedrich , dispense with anything that involves higher operating expenses or development costs . danish success several danish low-cost firms , telmore and cbb mobil , have managed to give big carriers a few sleepless nights with their success .
the two have acquired 43.7 percent of all new mobile customers from 2000 to 2003 .
today , more than 20 percent of mobile customers are using a discount mobile service provider . the developments in denmark have led the mobile phone providers across europe , even in countries without low-cost players , to consider what their future strategies should be .
some are considering offering their own inexpensive plans or creating subsidiaries to try to beat the arrival of the low-cost competition - an event that the big firms say is a given . " after telmore several companies , such as tele.ring in austria and sunrise in switzerland as good candidates for restructuring into low-cost carriers , " said friedrich .
" in sweden and the netherlands there are several companies currently in the starting blocks . " in germany , new providers are sure to mix up the mobile telephony landscape .
the current market structure , two large and two small providers , is considered by the sector to be unstable and nearly predestined for the entry of one or more low-cost carriers .

amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

a nato spokesman said that some accusations seemed out of date and said that each country was responsible for the conduct of their soldiers .
the united nations said in a statement that the report was outdated and drew " heavily on conditions existing in 1999-2001 , when the un mission in kosovo was at the incipient stage . " " outdated information from that period is extrapolated on and presented as current , " the statement continued . germany not aware of any investigations the german defense ministry , which has 3,600 soldiers as part of the nato mission in kosovo , said it had yet to read the report .
in 1999 and 2000 , german soldiers were accused of visiting underage sex workers , according to reports and a defense ministry spokesman .
but the spokesman told dw-world that the ministry found no wrong doing .
he said he was not aware of any current investigations . " there are very clear taboos for german soldiers , " the spokesman said , adding that soldiers are restricted to living on military bases .
" there is legal consequences if a soldier ignores them .
that is made very clear in training . " the un said that it too had implemented tough punishment for violators as early as 2001 , setting up a trafficking and prostitution investigation unit to work together with police and women 's advocacy groups .
amnesty says more needs to be done , including guaranteeing victims redress and reparation and setting up some sort of witness protection program for the women . " trafficking of women and girls in kosovo and other post-conflict situations will never end as long as the perpetrators go free , " said the organization .

amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

a nato spokesman said that some accusations seemed out of date and said that each country was responsible for the conduct of their soldiers .
the united nations said in a statement that the report was outdated and drew " heavily on conditions existing in 1999-2001 , when the un mission in kosovo was at the incipient stage .

that is made very clear in training . " the un said that it too had implemented tough punishment for violators as early as 2001 , setting up a trafficking and prostitution investigation unit to work together with police and women 's advocacy groups .
amnesty says more needs to be done , including guaranteeing victims redress and reparation and setting up some sort of witness protection program for the women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.05.2004 eu wants " some good will " in mideast peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish foreign minister cowen : please activate the middle east " road map " the eu called on the israelis and the palestinians to finally activate the " road map " meant to resolve their conflict after talks between the bloc , nine southern neighbors and the palestinian authority on thursday . irish foreign minister brian cowen said he saw chances for a ceasefire between the israelis and palestinians at the european union-mediterranean talks in the irish capital . cowen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called on both sides to finally enact the peace plan brokered by the so-called middle east quartet made up of the eu , russia , the united states and the united nations . " the israeli government 's position is that it supports the road map .
we support the road map .
everyone supports the road map , " said cowen .
" now could we please have some activation on the road map and implementation and some good will demonstrated and not allow the enemies of peace to dictate the agenda process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom unlike the united states , however , the european union plays a secondary role in middle east peace mediation , something acknowledged by israeli foreign minister silvan shalom -lrb- photo -rrb- .
shalom attacked the eu behind closed doors , saying the bloc often sided with the palestinians . following prime minister ariel sharon 's failed attempt to get his likud party to appove his plan to withdraw from the gaza strip , shalom said the party would alter the plan accordingly . despite the fact that the palestinian chief negotiator refused to meet his israeli counterpart for discussions , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the meeting was a success .
the european union was able to hear both the opinions of both arab states and the israelis on the conflict . partnership a success eu foreign policy chief javier solana praised the partnership between europe and the mediterranean countries , which started in 1995 . " even despite the difficulties that in that region continue to take place … we have been able to continue working together and doing things which are very beneficial for the countries of this region , " solana said . slow progress was being made to support economic and political reforms , and that the long-term aim remained establishing a free trade zone around the mediterranean in 2010 , eu diplomats said .
the eu already has such an agreement with algeria , morocco , tunisia and jordan .
altogether , the european union and the european investment bank provide € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- for cultural work , educational exchanges and training and reform programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " it 's not a question of whether enough comes back .
instead it 's an investment in stability , " said fischer .
" the central question for european security in the 21st century is whether the mediterranean will become a sea of cooperation or confrontation .
that is not only for the mediterranean states of the eu , but for all of us , of paramount importance . " not too busy for the south eu foreign policy commissioner chris patten countered accusations that the eu was too occupied with its own expansion from 10 to 25 states to look southward . he said the eu-med program " enables us to focus more on ways in which people help those countries which wish … to share much more fully in our market and in the way we do things in the union .

" the israeli government 's position is that it supports the road map .
we support the road map .
everyone supports the road map , " said cowen .
" now could we please have some activation on the road map and implementation and some good will demonstrated and not allow the enemies of peace to dictate the agenda process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom unlike the united states , however , the european union plays a secondary role in middle east peace mediation , something acknowledged by israeli foreign minister silvan shalom -lrb- photo -rrb- .
shalom attacked the eu behind closed doors , saying the bloc often sided with the palestinians . following prime minister ariel sharon 's failed attempt to get his likud party to appove his plan to withdraw from the gaza strip , shalom said the party would alter the plan accordingly . despite the fact that the palestinian chief negotiator refused to meet his israeli counterpart for discussions , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the meeting was a success .
the european union was able to hear both the opinions of both arab states and the israelis on the conflict . partnership a success eu foreign policy chief javier solana praised the partnership between europe and the mediterranean countries , which started in 1995 . " even despite the difficulties that in that region continue to take place … we have been able to continue working together and doing things which are very beneficial for the countries of this region , " solana said . slow progress was being made to support economic and political reforms , and that the long-term aim remained establishing a free trade zone around the mediterranean in 2010 , eu diplomats said .
the eu already has such an agreement with algeria , morocco , tunisia and jordan .
altogether , the european union and the european investment bank provide € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- for cultural work , educational exchanges and training and reform programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " it 's not a question of whether enough comes back .
instead it 's an investment in stability , " said fischer .
" the central question for european security in the 21st century is whether the mediterranean will become a sea of cooperation or confrontation .
that is not only for the mediterranean states of the eu , but for all of us , of paramount importance . " not too busy for the south eu foreign policy commissioner chris patten countered accusations that the eu was too occupied with its own expansion from 10 to 25 states to look southward . he said the eu-med program " enables us to focus more on ways in which people help those countries which wish … to share much more fully in our market and in the way we do things in the union .
it 's a direct rebuttal of the proposition that enlargement of the european union would lead to a ' fortress europe ' . " besides libya , all north african states are part of the eu-mediterranean program .
but since libyan leader muammar gadhafi 's visit to brussels in late april , the chances have improved for the country , which had observer status at the dublin talks , to be integrated into the eu 's program . " we aim to become a full member , but that will still take come time and agreement in our own bodies , " libyan foreign minister mohammed abdul rahman shalgan said . however , since a libyan court sentenced bulgarian doctors to death this week for allegedly infecting children with the hiv virus , relations have been put on ice .
but cowen made clear that change will only come if the sentence is rescinded and a solution is found . berndt riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe-med forum to push for middle east ceasefire stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday .

german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .
skilled employees and tomorrow 's experts " do n't just fall from heaven , " said germany 's social democratic education minister edelgard bulmahn -lrb- right -rrb- before friday 's debate and vote in the bundestag . " they must be trained , " she said . the vote passed 300-284 in parliament and does not need approval of the opposition-controlled upper house . the government has been critical of companies that are able of offering traineeships , but do not .
last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines . " we are locked into fragile economic times and issuing threats is n't going to improve the climate for hiring , " martin wansleben , managing director of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told reporters .
" this law is disastrous . " opposition politicians were no more supportive .
guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation .

german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .
skilled employees and tomorrow 's experts " do n't just fall from heaven , " said germany 's social democratic education minister edelgard bulmahn -lrb- right -rrb- before friday 's debate and vote in the bundestag . " they must be trained , " she said . the vote passed 300-284 in parliament and does not need approval of the opposition-controlled upper house . the government has been critical of companies that are able of offering traineeships , but do not .
last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines . " we are locked into fragile economic times and issuing threats is n't going to improve the climate for hiring , " martin wansleben , managing director of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told reporters .
" this law is disastrous . " opposition politicians were no more supportive .
guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation . " " this is not a good day for vocational training in germany , " he told the ddp news agency . business or young people first ? but green party parliamentarian grietje bettin criticized opposition politicians for only looking out for the interests of the business community and ignoring the needs of young people in need of training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she said the fine should not be seen as a penalty , but rather as a fair and socially just method to create a balance between companies that do train and those that do not . nicolette kressl of the spd responded to opposition criticism by saying politicians from those parties had not suggested any alternative measures to increase the overall number of traineeships on offer . the move to pass some kind of legislation gained momentum last year , when 35,000 people who sought traineeships failed to find one .
there were 182,000 apprenticeships in total last month , about 27,000 lower than the year before , according to germany 's federal labor agency . in a survey carried out by the university of dortmund , 42 percent of german parents asked said they worried that their child would not find " an appropriate traineeship " after leaving school , up from 32 percent a decade ago .
in the eastern part of germany , 24 percent were against the imposition of fines on companies which did not sufficiently train .
in western germany , only 19 percent were against such a system . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder gets tough on traineeship deficit german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo .

u.s. president george w bush has reacted with shock at the images of torture in iraqi prisons by american soldiers .

" the political damage for the usa is so immense , " writes munich 's süddeutsche zeitung , " that even the resignation of donald rumsfeld wo n't even things out . "
but a political victim would send a particularly believable sign that the american government takes seriously its own moral assertions and values that it tries to hold up in iraq .
the paper suggests donald rumsfeld 's resignation would be a sign of humility that has been sorely lacking in him for too long .
for the lübecker nachrichten there 's much to suggest that the pentagon chief donald rumsfeld will be the first to fall over this scandal .
but , adds the paper , even president bush ca n't slip away from personal responsibility .
" that the president in front of arabic television could not even bring himself to say sorry is disgraceful . "
" this gesture was the absolute minimum requirement , " writes the daily , " because now the us which was supposed to stand for freedom and democracy , symbolizes the worst things humans are capable of , brutality , humiliation and inhumanity . "
" this has n't just happened out of the blue , " writes the aachener nachrichten .
" why , then , has the bush administration been so willing to hand over al qaeda suspects captured in afghanistan to other countries ?
the answer is quite simply because their more vigorous interrogation methods will see results .
or if we put it another way , " writes the daily , " because they engage in torture . "

the damage done by this behavior is enormous , the paper wrote .
the scandal for the rest of the world confirms that the united states has taken on more than it can handle in iraq .
the paper said george w. bush will have to make a sacrifice in washington and the most prominent victim could be the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld . italy ’ s corriere della sera agreed , but added that there is more than rumsfeld ’ s scalp at stake .
the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .
but , the paper points out , he only earns one or two cents a liter .

the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .
but , the paper points out , he only earns one or two cents a liter .
the oil companies take about 15 cents and the oil sheikhs earn 18 cents a liter .
the other 80-odd cents , the paper concluded , goes into the coffers of the german government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.05.2004 mobile phone carriers feel the heat from low-cost rivals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-cost providers are likely to introduce bargain-basement phone rates across europe .
big european mobile phone carriers are now facing a headache big airlines have already confronted : low-cost competition .
the mobile phone equivalents of ryanair and easyjet are promising to shake up the market . it was probably only a question of time until some enterprising businessperson saw the possibilities in emulating the successful model of the low-cost air carriers .
while ryanair , german wings and hapag-lloyd have undercut the giants of the aviation industry and forced them to radically reevaluate how they do business , mobile phone upstarts like denmark 's telmore are doing the same in its own sector . after years of growth , the european mobile phone market is saturated , since already 80 percent of europeans already own mobile phones .
mobile phone service providers can not count on basing future business strategies on winning new customers .
they are n't there to be had . " in the next few years , a segmentation of the market is going to take place , similar to what we 've seen with the airlines , " roman friedrich , telecoms analyst at the consulting firm booz allen hamilton deutschland , told dw-world .
he said according to studies his firm has carried out , the european mobile phone market is standing just before a turning point . " by the end of the year in europe there will several low-cost providers and in two years at the most , in almost every country there will be at least one big low-cost operator , " he said . up to 60 percent cheaper it 's likely that low-cost mobile phone providers will find the same enthusiastic reception as europe 's low-cost air carriers have .
friedrich estimates that up to 20 percent of mobile phone users could switch to low-cost carriers . for those who use their mobile phones for just telephoning and have little interest in high-tech extras or service hotlines , low-cost providers are an attractive alternative .
prices can run from 30 to 40 percent under those charged by the big carriers , or in some cases , up to 60 percent . those however who put value on having the newest , sleekest phone on the market in their purse or pocket and want to play games , get news , or download music and videos will be disappointed .
the low-cost players , according to friedrich , dispense with anything that involves higher operating expenses or development costs . danish success several danish low-cost firms , telmore and cbb mobil , have managed to give big carriers a few sleepless nights with their success .
the two have acquired 43.7 percent of all new mobile customers from 2000 to 2003 .
today , more than 20 percent of mobile customers are using a discount mobile service provider . the developments in denmark have led the mobile phone providers across europe , even in countries without low-cost players , to consider what their future strategies should be .
some are considering offering their own inexpensive plans or creating subsidiaries to try to beat the arrival of the low-cost competition - an event that the big firms say is a given . " after telmore several companies , such as tele.ring in austria and sunrise in switzerland as good candidates for restructuring into low-cost carriers , " said friedrich .
" in sweden and the netherlands there are several companies currently in the starting blocks . " in germany , new providers are sure to mix up the mobile telephony landscape .
the current market structure , two large and two small providers , is considered by the sector to be unstable and nearly predestined for the entry of one or more low-cost carriers .
the only question companies are asking is who will make the first step . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de third generation mobile phones arrive in germany it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany .

it was n't that the fans were surprised that their team made it to the finals .
the eisbären had been riding high all season thanks to a line-up of experienced foreign players and young german talent .
but national success is still relatively new for the former east german team .
today , it 's one of the few sports teams from the old gdr that 's risen to the top of the league in reunified germany .
in recent years , the eisbären have even outplayed the west berlin team , the berlin capitals . " it ’ s really something that the eisbären are doing so well now , " local sports journalist klaus weiser told dw-world .
" they ’ re a bit of a cult team , with a long tradition , they ’ ve always been really popular in east berlin .
they were the east german champions 15 times , and after reunification when they played nationally with western teams , they were among the worst , always at the bottom .
but the stadium was always full , and the fans have always been behind them . ” champions of world 's smallest league it ’ s true that the eisbären were at the top of their league in east germany .
but that ’ s not too difficult when the league only has two teams .
the lack of funds for hockey in the gdr meant the eisbären , then known as dynamo berlin , faced off over and over against the only other team in the country , dynamo whitewater .
the players knew each other ’ s style inside out , down to the way they laced up their skates . in 1990 , following german reunification , the eisbären placed a dismal 11th in the national league .
five years later , they were in 17th place .
then , in 1996 , salvation came in the bosman ruling , a court decision which allowed the unlimited employment of foreign players .
the eisbären were one of the first hockey teams to take advantage of the ruling , swapping almost their entire team for talented imports from eastern europe , scandinavia , and north america .
that season , they placed fourth . billionaire investor , foreign players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eisbärens ' logo another stroke of luck came in 1999 , when billionaire american businessman philip anschutz bought the team .
a short while later , he hired the team ’ s current coach , canadian pierre pagé , formerly the coach of such national hockey league -lrb- nhl -rrb- teams as the calgary flames and the anaheim mighty ducks . " it starts with a vision , " pagé said .
" when anschutz came here , he first put some order in the financial books , and then started building a foundation for the team .
people said it could n't be done here , because of all the problems in the past .
but they were wrong .
we respect tradition and history .
we wouldn ’ t be here if it wasn ’ t for the berlin dynamo , they started the whole thing in 1954 . " pagé says his team has the best , most loyal fans in the german hockey league .
and , in turn , the fans are grateful to him and the eisbären 's contingent of foreign players for giving them back a team they can be proud of .
" the foreign players are the very heart of the team right now , " said oliver , a german hockey enthusiast .

deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .
but will the news revive germany 's flagging shareholder culture ? stock market enthusiasts have reason to hope again .
the head of postbank , wulf von schimmelmann , and the executive chairman of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , have big things planned . on june 21 , postbank goes public .
with its clear position as a private bank and a low-risk business model , the credit institute is " fit for the stock market , " said zumwinkel . postbank plans to list up to 50 percent of its equity capital minus one share on the german stock exchange - meaning that deutsche post will remain the majority shareholder .
a price range for the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
experts are already speculating on a price of € 30 per share .
proceeds of about € 3 billion should flow into deutsche post 's coffers as a result of the listing .
the company said it plans to use the money on a stratetgic expansion - among the countries mentioned were austria and denmark .
prognosis positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is the largest private bank in germany .
at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .
and with good reason .
postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .
" the savings deposits alone have climbed by € 1.6 billion , " he said , adding that , last year , the bank managed to triple its net profits in comparison with the previous year .
all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .
shortly before the postbank ipo was announced , the financial times deutschland reported that deutsche bank was aiming for a complete takeover of postbank , and that there 'd already been discussions to that effect with the government .

at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .

postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .

all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .

it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.05.2004 fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 7.3 million foreigners have already made germany their home .
the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details . four days after the green party pulled out of crucial immigration talks with the conservative opposition - prompting talk of a government crisis - germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens have agreed to bury differences and search for common ground on continuing negotiations . following a government summit meeting in chancellor schröder 's office on friday , representatives from the two parties said they had reached a compromise , according to which the chancellor will hold special meetings with the conservative opposition of christian democrats and its sister party , the christian social union , to determine whether there were any chances for a all-party accord on a new immigration law . but , in the end it would be up to a government committee to decide whether immigration negotiations with the conservative opposition should continue .
the new immigration law is in effect designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and facilitate companies to recruit skilled staff from abroad . the government summit meeting on friday agreed on a declaration in which they accused the opposition christian democrats of blocking talks thus far .

the new immigration law is in effect designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and facilitate companies to recruit skilled staff from abroad . the government summit meeting on friday agreed on a declaration in which they accused the opposition christian democrats of blocking talks thus far .
the declaration also stressed that to avoid the immigration law from " becoming an instrument in election campaigns , " the decision on further talks would be taken before the european elections on june 13 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader reinhard bütikofer spd chairman franz müntefering said on friday , " a common law is the priority . " green party chief reinhard bütikofer -lrb- photo -rrb- emphasized that it was important that further negotiations with the opposition were marked by a " clear timetable " and a " clear alternative . " conservatives make security issue a priority the latest crisis in the immigration debate came after the greens abandoned talks on monday , saying the conservative opposition was hell-bent on including anti-terrorism measures in the immigration package - a move the greens believe has nothing to do with immigration directly and was blocking all other issues . " we do n't believe that we can come to a responsible solution with the christian democrats , " bütikofer told daily tagesspiegel on thursday . the christian democrats insist - in light of the recent terrorist attacks in madrid - that an accord on the immigration law hinges on reaching agreement on important internal security issues .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .

the damage done by this behavior is enormous , the paper wrote .
the scandal for the rest of the world confirms that the united states has taken on more than it can handle in iraq .
the paper said george w. bush will have to make a sacrifice in washington and the most prominent victim could be the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld . italy ’ s corriere della sera agreed , but added that there is more than rumsfeld ’ s scalp at stake .
the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .

the damage done by this behavior is enormous , the paper wrote .
the scandal for the rest of the world confirms that the united states has taken on more than it can handle in iraq .
the paper said george w. bush will have to make a sacrifice in washington and the most prominent victim could be the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld . italy ’ s corriere della sera agreed , but added that there is more than rumsfeld ’ s scalp at stake .
the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .
but , the paper points out , he only earns one or two cents a liter .
the oil companies take about 15 cents and the oil sheikhs earn 18 cents a liter .

" the political damage for the usa is so immense , " writes munich 's süddeutsche zeitung , " that even the resignation of donald rumsfeld wo n't even things out . "
but a political victim would send a particularly believable sign that the american government takes seriously its own moral assertions and values that it tries to hold up in iraq .
the paper suggests donald rumsfeld 's resignation would be a sign of humility that has been sorely lacking in him for too long .
for the lübecker nachrichten there 's much to suggest that the pentagon chief donald rumsfeld will be the first to fall over this scandal .
but , adds the paper , even president bush ca n't slip away from personal responsibility .
" that the president in front of arabic television could not even bring himself to say sorry is disgraceful . "
" this gesture was the absolute minimum requirement , " writes the daily , " because now the us which was supposed to stand for freedom and democracy , symbolizes the worst things humans are capable of , brutality , humiliation and inhumanity . "
" this has n't just happened out of the blue , " writes the aachener nachrichten .
" why , then , has the bush administration been so willing to hand over al qaeda suspects captured in afghanistan to other countries ?
the answer is quite simply because their more vigorous interrogation methods will see results .
or if we put it another way , " writes the daily , " because they engage in torture . "
u.s. president george w bush has reacted with shock at the images of torture in iraqi prisons by american soldiers .
but adds the paper , " the question remains whether it 's the torture itself that disturbs the president or the images of the torture ? "
the financial times deutschland writes that the accusations of torture against u.s. soldiers has grown to a barely containable foreign policy issue for the white house and notes that half a year before the presidential elections the topic of iraq is again the central issue .
but the paper doubts that the presidential candidate john kerry will be able to utilize this scandal to his advantage .
the paper believes president bush 's interview on arabic television was designed for an american audience to show he was taking responsibility .
and according to this daily there 's no sign yet that bush will lose the election on the issue of iraq .
the rise in crude oil prices pushing petrol in germany to € 1.20 per liter leaves many papers grumbling .
the mass-circulation bild zeitung writes that at the petrol stations three drivers did n't bother to fill their tanks .
" everyone 's scrimping and saving , " writes the paper .
" but the politicians that are chauffeured around for free should realize that germany needs to remain mobile , to transport the millions of commuters and the goods they produce - otherwise the country will be threatened by stoppages and everyone will be poorer , " the paper argues .
the mittelbayerisch zeitung from regensburg disagrees - while the german auto club adac the opposition conservatives and others call for the eco-tax to be dropped – the southern german paper argues that this environmental levy has sensible and long-term goals .
world oil prices will fall again , points out the daily , and dropping the eco levy for two weeks to alleviate higher petrol prices is a short-term solution that will have no impact .

german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .
skilled employees and tomorrow 's experts " do n't just fall from heaven , " said germany 's social democratic education minister edelgard bulmahn -lrb- right -rrb- before friday 's debate and vote in the bundestag . " they must be trained , " she said . the vote passed 300-284 in parliament and does not need approval of the opposition-controlled upper house . the government has been critical of companies that are able of offering traineeships , but do not .
last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines . " we are locked into fragile economic times and issuing threats is n't going to improve the climate for hiring , " martin wansleben , managing director of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told reporters .
" this law is disastrous . " opposition politicians were no more supportive .
guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation . " " this is not a good day for vocational training in germany , " he told the ddp news agency . business or young people first ? but green party parliamentarian grietje bettin criticized opposition politicians for only looking out for the interests of the business community and ignoring the needs of young people in need of training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she said the fine should not be seen as a penalty , but rather as a fair and socially just method to create a balance between companies that do train and those that do not . nicolette kressl of the spd responded to opposition criticism by saying politicians from those parties had not suggested any alternative measures to increase the overall number of traineeships on offer . the move to pass some kind of legislation gained momentum last year , when 35,000 people who sought traineeships failed to find one .
there were 182,000 apprenticeships in total last month , about 27,000 lower than the year before , according to germany 's federal labor agency . in a survey carried out by the university of dortmund , 42 percent of german parents asked said they worried that their child would not find " an appropriate traineeship " after leaving school , up from 32 percent a decade ago .

last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines . " we are locked into fragile economic times and issuing threats is n't going to improve the climate for hiring , " martin wansleben , managing director of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told reporters .
" this law is disastrous . " opposition politicians were no more supportive .
guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation . " " this is not a good day for vocational training in germany , " he told the ddp news agency . business or young people first ? but green party parliamentarian grietje bettin criticized opposition politicians for only looking out for the interests of the business community and ignoring the needs of young people in need of training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she said the fine should not be seen as a penalty , but rather as a fair and socially just method to create a balance between companies that do train and those that do not . nicolette kressl of the spd responded to opposition criticism by saying politicians from those parties had not suggested any alternative measures to increase the overall number of traineeships on offer . the move to pass some kind of legislation gained momentum last year , when 35,000 people who sought traineeships failed to find one .
there were 182,000 apprenticeships in total last month , about 27,000 lower than the year before , according to germany 's federal labor agency . in a survey carried out by the university of dortmund , 42 percent of german parents asked said they worried that their child would not find " an appropriate traineeship " after leaving school , up from 32 percent a decade ago .
in the eastern part of germany , 24 percent were against the imposition of fines on companies which did not sufficiently train .
in western germany , only 19 percent were against such a system . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder gets tough on traineeship deficit german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo .

" the israeli government 's position is that it supports the road map .
we support the road map .
everyone supports the road map , " said cowen .
" now could we please have some activation on the road map and implementation and some good will demonstrated and not allow the enemies of peace to dictate the agenda process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom unlike the united states , however , the european union plays a secondary role in middle east peace mediation , something acknowledged by israeli foreign minister silvan shalom -lrb- photo -rrb- .
shalom attacked the eu behind closed doors , saying the bloc often sided with the palestinians . following prime minister ariel sharon 's failed attempt to get his likud party to appove his plan to withdraw from the gaza strip , shalom said the party would alter the plan accordingly . despite the fact that the palestinian chief negotiator refused to meet his israeli counterpart for discussions , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the meeting was a success .
the european union was able to hear both the opinions of both arab states and the israelis on the conflict . partnership a success eu foreign policy chief javier solana praised the partnership between europe and the mediterranean countries , which started in 1995 . " even despite the difficulties that in that region continue to take place … we have been able to continue working together and doing things which are very beneficial for the countries of this region , " solana said . slow progress was being made to support economic and political reforms , and that the long-term aim remained establishing a free trade zone around the mediterranean in 2010 , eu diplomats said .
the eu already has such an agreement with algeria , morocco , tunisia and jordan .
altogether , the european union and the european investment bank provide € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- for cultural work , educational exchanges and training and reform programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " it 's not a question of whether enough comes back .
instead it 's an investment in stability , " said fischer .
" the central question for european security in the 21st century is whether the mediterranean will become a sea of cooperation or confrontation .
that is not only for the mediterranean states of the eu , but for all of us , of paramount importance . " not too busy for the south eu foreign policy commissioner chris patten countered accusations that the eu was too occupied with its own expansion from 10 to 25 states to look southward . he said the eu-med program " enables us to focus more on ways in which people help those countries which wish … to share much more fully in our market and in the way we do things in the union .
it 's a direct rebuttal of the proposition that enlargement of the european union would lead to a ' fortress europe ' . " besides libya , all north african states are part of the eu-mediterranean program .
but since libyan leader muammar gadhafi 's visit to brussels in late april , the chances have improved for the country , which had observer status at the dublin talks , to be integrated into the eu 's program . " we aim to become a full member , but that will still take come time and agreement in our own bodies , " libyan foreign minister mohammed abdul rahman shalgan said . however , since a libyan court sentenced bulgarian doctors to death this week for allegedly infecting children with the hiv virus , relations have been put on ice .
but cowen made clear that change will only come if the sentence is rescinded and a solution is found . berndt riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe-med forum to push for middle east ceasefire stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday .

german politicians say berlin missed a great chance at publicity after the parliament refused to allow hollywood star tom cruise to shoot " mission impossible 3 " in berlin 's historic reichstag building . a month after tom cruise arrived in berlin to check out possible locations for the third part of his spy thriller " mission impossible " - the hollywood hunk has been given the cold shoulder by the german parliament . cruise was apparently fascinated by the reichstag 's spectacular glass dome and wanted to shoot there .
but the idea of a hollywood crew trampling through the hallowed corridors of the seat of german democracy was , it seems , too much for parliamentary president wolfgang thierse to bear . earlier this week , he shot down cruise 's wish .
" it 's about preserving the dignity of the parliament , " thierse 's spokesman hans hotter said . but the issue continued to simmer on thursday after politicians from the greens and free democrats bemoaned thierse 's decision .
the parliamentarians said germany had missed a chance to raise its international profile .
" it 's great if such films do n't just play against the backdrop of los angeles or new york , but also in berlin or paris , " greens deputy floor leader volker beck said . " if such a blockbuster can make the reichstag building an international star , then the parliament should n't be so parochial , " free democrats chief guido westerwelle said , adding it was a " brilliant chance to spark worldwide interest in berlin and to lure visitors to germany . " president of berlin 's city-state parliament , walter momper insisted that cruise could still film in berlin and offered his own office , the former prussian assembly building , as an alternative location .
" mr cruise should show us the screenplay , and if it fits with the dignity of the building , then he can film here by paying a small fee , " momper told daily berliner kurier . but , as it turns out , the outcry may be hugely overestimating what 's at stake .
a source at the babelsberg film studios near potsdam told news magazine spiegel that all director joe carnahan wanted was to " shoot a really simple dialogue scene in the dome of the reichstag , " not a sophisticated one with special effects and the works . babelsberg spokesman felix neunzerling too added it was n't a big deal .

amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

a nato spokesman said that some accusations seemed out of date and said that each country was responsible for the conduct of their soldiers .
the united nations said in a statement that the report was outdated and drew " heavily on conditions existing in 1999-2001 , when the un mission in kosovo was at the incipient stage . " " outdated information from that period is extrapolated on and presented as current , " the statement continued . germany not aware of any investigations the german defense ministry , which has 3,600 soldiers as part of the nato mission in kosovo , said it had yet to read the report .
in 1999 and 2000 , german soldiers were accused of visiting underage sex workers , according to reports and a defense ministry spokesman .
but the spokesman told dw-world that the ministry found no wrong doing .
he said he was not aware of any current investigations . " there are very clear taboos for german soldiers , " the spokesman said , adding that soldiers are restricted to living on military bases .
" there is legal consequences if a soldier ignores them .
that is made very clear in training . " the un said that it too had implemented tough punishment for violators as early as 2001 , setting up a trafficking and prostitution investigation unit to work together with police and women 's advocacy groups .
amnesty says more needs to be done , including guaranteeing victims redress and reparation and setting up some sort of witness protection program for the women . " trafficking of women and girls in kosovo and other post-conflict situations will never end as long as the perpetrators go free , " said the organization .
" and as long as civilian and military personnel are allowed to commit human rights violations with impunity .

a nato spokesman said that some accusations seemed out of date and said that each country was responsible for the conduct of their soldiers .
the united nations said in a statement that the report was outdated and drew " heavily on conditions existing in 1999-2001 , when the un mission in kosovo was at the incipient stage . " " outdated information from that period is extrapolated on and presented as current , " the statement continued . germany not aware of any investigations the german defense ministry , which has 3,600 soldiers as part of the nato mission in kosovo , said it had yet to read the report .
in 1999 and 2000 , german soldiers were accused of visiting underage sex workers , according to reports and a defense ministry spokesman .
but the spokesman told dw-world that the ministry found no wrong doing .
he said he was not aware of any current investigations . " there are very clear taboos for german soldiers , " the spokesman said , adding that soldiers are restricted to living on military bases .
" there is legal consequences if a soldier ignores them .
that is made very clear in training . " the un said that it too had implemented tough punishment for violators as early as 2001 , setting up a trafficking and prostitution investigation unit to work together with police and women 's advocacy groups .
amnesty says more needs to be done , including guaranteeing victims redress and reparation and setting up some sort of witness protection program for the women . " trafficking of women and girls in kosovo and other post-conflict situations will never end as long as the perpetrators go free , " said the organization .
" and as long as civilian and military personnel are allowed to commit human rights violations with impunity . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck : nato needs to stay in kosovo beyond 2006 german defense minister peter struck has said peacekeepers will have to remain in kosovo much longer than previously expected after recent clashes between serbs and albanians in the region .

big european mobile phone carriers are now facing a headache big airlines have already confronted : low-cost competition .
the mobile phone equivalents of ryanair and easyjet are promising to shake up the market . it was probably only a question of time until some enterprising businessperson saw the possibilities in emulating the successful model of the low-cost air carriers .
while ryanair , german wings and hapag-lloyd have undercut the giants of the aviation industry and forced them to radically reevaluate how they do business , mobile phone upstarts like denmark 's telmore are doing the same in its own sector . after years of growth , the european mobile phone market is saturated , since already 80 percent of europeans already own mobile phones .
mobile phone service providers can not count on basing future business strategies on winning new customers .
they are n't there to be had . " in the next few years , a segmentation of the market is going to take place , similar to what we 've seen with the airlines , " roman friedrich , telecoms analyst at the consulting firm booz allen hamilton deutschland , told dw-world .
he said according to studies his firm has carried out , the european mobile phone market is standing just before a turning point . " by the end of the year in europe there will several low-cost providers and in two years at the most , in almost every country there will be at least one big low-cost operator , " he said . up to 60 percent cheaper it 's likely that low-cost mobile phone providers will find the same enthusiastic reception as europe 's low-cost air carriers have .
friedrich estimates that up to 20 percent of mobile phone users could switch to low-cost carriers . for those who use their mobile phones for just telephoning and have little interest in high-tech extras or service hotlines , low-cost providers are an attractive alternative .
prices can run from 30 to 40 percent under those charged by the big carriers , or in some cases , up to 60 percent . those however who put value on having the newest , sleekest phone on the market in their purse or pocket and want to play games , get news , or download music and videos will be disappointed .
the low-cost players , according to friedrich , dispense with anything that involves higher operating expenses or development costs . danish success several danish low-cost firms , telmore and cbb mobil , have managed to give big carriers a few sleepless nights with their success .
the two have acquired 43.7 percent of all new mobile customers from 2000 to 2003 .
today , more than 20 percent of mobile customers are using a discount mobile service provider . the developments in denmark have led the mobile phone providers across europe , even in countries without low-cost players , to consider what their future strategies should be .
some are considering offering their own inexpensive plans or creating subsidiaries to try to beat the arrival of the low-cost competition - an event that the big firms say is a given . " after telmore several companies , such as tele.ring in austria and sunrise in switzerland as good candidates for restructuring into low-cost carriers , " said friedrich .
" in sweden and the netherlands there are several companies currently in the starting blocks . " in germany , new providers are sure to mix up the mobile telephony landscape .
the current market structure , two large and two small providers , is considered by the sector to be unstable and nearly predestined for the entry of one or more low-cost carriers .

german politicians say berlin missed a great chance at publicity after the parliament refused to allow hollywood star tom cruise to shoot " mission impossible 3 " in berlin 's historic reichstag building . a month after tom cruise arrived in berlin to check out possible locations for the third part of his spy thriller " mission impossible " - the hollywood hunk has been given the cold shoulder by the german parliament . cruise was apparently fascinated by the reichstag 's spectacular glass dome and wanted to shoot there .
but the idea of a hollywood crew trampling through the hallowed corridors of the seat of german democracy was , it seems , too much for parliamentary president wolfgang thierse to bear . earlier this week , he shot down cruise 's wish .
" it 's about preserving the dignity of the parliament , " thierse 's spokesman hans hotter said . but the issue continued to simmer on thursday after politicians from the greens and free democrats bemoaned thierse 's decision .
the parliamentarians said germany had missed a chance to raise its international profile .
" it 's great if such films do n't just play against the backdrop of los angeles or new york , but also in berlin or paris , " greens deputy floor leader volker beck said . " if such a blockbuster can make the reichstag building an international star , then the parliament should n't be so parochial , " free democrats chief guido westerwelle said , adding it was a " brilliant chance to spark worldwide interest in berlin and to lure visitors to germany . " president of berlin 's city-state parliament , walter momper insisted that cruise could still film in berlin and offered his own office , the former prussian assembly building , as an alternative location .
" mr cruise should show us the screenplay , and if it fits with the dignity of the building , then he can film here by paying a small fee , " momper told daily berliner kurier . but , as it turns out , the outcry may be hugely overestimating what 's at stake .
a source at the babelsberg film studios near potsdam told news magazine spiegel that all director joe carnahan wanted was to " shoot a really simple dialogue scene in the dome of the reichstag , " not a sophisticated one with special effects and the works . babelsberg spokesman felix neunzerling too added it was n't a big deal .

amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

a nato spokesman said that some accusations seemed out of date and said that each country was responsible for the conduct of their soldiers .
the united nations said in a statement that the report was outdated and drew " heavily on conditions existing in 1999-2001 , when the un mission in kosovo was at the incipient stage .

that is made very clear in training . " the un said that it too had implemented tough punishment for violators as early as 2001 , setting up a trafficking and prostitution investigation unit to work together with police and women 's advocacy groups .
amnesty says more needs to be done , including guaranteeing victims redress and reparation and setting up some sort of witness protection program for the women .

amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

amnesty says more needs to be done , including guaranteeing victims redress and reparation and setting up some sort of witness protection program for the women .

amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

a nato spokesman said that some accusations seemed out of date and said that each country was responsible for the conduct of their soldiers .
the united nations said in a statement that the report was outdated and drew " heavily on conditions existing in 1999-2001 , when the un mission in kosovo was at the incipient stage . " " outdated information from that period is extrapolated on and presented as current , " the statement continued . germany not aware of any investigations the german defense ministry , which has 3,600 soldiers as part of the nato mission in kosovo , said it had yet to read the report .
in 1999 and 2000 , german soldiers were accused of visiting underage sex workers , according to reports and a defense ministry spokesman .
but the spokesman told dw-world that the ministry found no wrong doing .
he said he was not aware of any current investigations . " there are very clear taboos for german soldiers , " the spokesman said , adding that soldiers are restricted to living on military bases .
" there is legal consequences if a soldier ignores them .
that is made very clear in training . " the un said that it too had implemented tough punishment for violators as early as 2001 , setting up a trafficking and prostitution investigation unit to work together with police and women 's advocacy groups .
amnesty says more needs to be done , including guaranteeing victims redress and reparation and setting up some sort of witness protection program for the women . " trafficking of women and girls in kosovo and other post-conflict situations will never end as long as the perpetrators go free , " said the organization .
" and as long as civilian and military personnel are allowed to commit human rights violations with impunity .

big european mobile phone carriers are now facing a headache big airlines have already confronted : low-cost competition .
the mobile phone equivalents of ryanair and easyjet are promising to shake up the market . it was probably only a question of time until some enterprising businessperson saw the possibilities in emulating the successful model of the low-cost air carriers .
while ryanair , german wings and hapag-lloyd have undercut the giants of the aviation industry and forced them to radically reevaluate how they do business , mobile phone upstarts like denmark 's telmore are doing the same in its own sector . after years of growth , the european mobile phone market is saturated , since already 80 percent of europeans already own mobile phones .
mobile phone service providers can not count on basing future business strategies on winning new customers .
they are n't there to be had . " in the next few years , a segmentation of the market is going to take place , similar to what we 've seen with the airlines , " roman friedrich , telecoms analyst at the consulting firm booz allen hamilton deutschland , told dw-world .
he said according to studies his firm has carried out , the european mobile phone market is standing just before a turning point . " by the end of the year in europe there will several low-cost providers and in two years at the most , in almost every country there will be at least one big low-cost operator , " he said . up to 60 percent cheaper it 's likely that low-cost mobile phone providers will find the same enthusiastic reception as europe 's low-cost air carriers have .
friedrich estimates that up to 20 percent of mobile phone users could switch to low-cost carriers . for those who use their mobile phones for just telephoning and have little interest in high-tech extras or service hotlines , low-cost providers are an attractive alternative .
prices can run from 30 to 40 percent under those charged by the big carriers , or in some cases , up to 60 percent . those however who put value on having the newest , sleekest phone on the market in their purse or pocket and want to play games , get news , or download music and videos will be disappointed .

the two have acquired 43.7 percent of all new mobile customers from 2000 to 2003 .
today , more than 20 percent of mobile customers are using a discount mobile service provider . the developments in denmark have led the mobile phone providers across europe , even in countries without low-cost players , to consider what their future strategies should be .
some are considering offering their own inexpensive plans or creating subsidiaries to try to beat the arrival of the low-cost competition - an event that the big firms say is a given . " after telmore several companies , such as tele.ring in austria and sunrise in switzerland as good candidates for restructuring into low-cost carriers , " said friedrich .
" in sweden and the netherlands there are several companies currently in the starting blocks . " in germany , new providers are sure to mix up the mobile telephony landscape .

the mobile phone equivalents of ryanair and easyjet are promising to shake up the market . it was probably only a question of time until some enterprising businessperson saw the possibilities in emulating the successful model of the low-cost air carriers .
while ryanair , german wings and hapag-lloyd have undercut the giants of the aviation industry and forced them to radically reevaluate how they do business , mobile phone upstarts like denmark 's telmore are doing the same in its own sector . after years of growth , the european mobile phone market is saturated , since already 80 percent of europeans already own mobile phones .
mobile phone service providers can not count on basing future business strategies on winning new customers .
they are n't there to be had . " in the next few years , a segmentation of the market is going to take place , similar to what we 've seen with the airlines , " roman friedrich , telecoms analyst at the consulting firm booz allen hamilton deutschland , told dw-world .
he said according to studies his firm has carried out , the european mobile phone market is standing just before a turning point . " by the end of the year in europe there will several low-cost providers and in two years at the most , in almost every country there will be at least one big low-cost operator , " he said . up to 60 percent cheaper it 's likely that low-cost mobile phone providers will find the same enthusiastic reception as europe 's low-cost air carriers have .
friedrich estimates that up to 20 percent of mobile phone users could switch to low-cost carriers . for those who use their mobile phones for just telephoning and have little interest in high-tech extras or service hotlines , low-cost providers are an attractive alternative .
prices can run from 30 to 40 percent under those charged by the big carriers , or in some cases , up to 60 percent . those however who put value on having the newest , sleekest phone on the market in their purse or pocket and want to play games , get news , or download music and videos will be disappointed .
the low-cost players , according to friedrich , dispense with anything that involves higher operating expenses or development costs . danish success several danish low-cost firms , telmore and cbb mobil , have managed to give big carriers a few sleepless nights with their success .
the two have acquired 43.7 percent of all new mobile customers from 2000 to 2003 .
today , more than 20 percent of mobile customers are using a discount mobile service provider . the developments in denmark have led the mobile phone providers across europe , even in countries without low-cost players , to consider what their future strategies should be .
some are considering offering their own inexpensive plans or creating subsidiaries to try to beat the arrival of the low-cost competition - an event that the big firms say is a given . " after telmore several companies , such as tele.ring in austria and sunrise in switzerland as good candidates for restructuring into low-cost carriers , " said friedrich .
" in sweden and the netherlands there are several companies currently in the starting blocks . " in germany , new providers are sure to mix up the mobile telephony landscape .
the current market structure , two large and two small providers , is considered by the sector to be unstable and nearly predestined for the entry of one or more low-cost carriers .

it was n't that the fans were surprised that their team made it to the finals .
the eisbären had been riding high all season thanks to a line-up of experienced foreign players and young german talent .
but national success is still relatively new for the former east german team .
today , it 's one of the few sports teams from the old gdr that 's risen to the top of the league in reunified germany .
in recent years , the eisbären have even outplayed the west berlin team , the berlin capitals . " it ’ s really something that the eisbären are doing so well now , " local sports journalist klaus weiser told dw-world .
" they ’ re a bit of a cult team , with a long tradition , they ’ ve always been really popular in east berlin .
they were the east german champions 15 times , and after reunification when they played nationally with western teams , they were among the worst , always at the bottom .

the players knew each other ’ s style inside out , down to the way they laced up their skates . in 1990 , following german reunification , the eisbären placed a dismal 11th in the national league .
five years later , they were in 17th place .
then , in 1996 , salvation came in the bosman ruling , a court decision which allowed the unlimited employment of foreign players .
the eisbären were one of the first hockey teams to take advantage of the ruling , swapping almost their entire team for talented imports from eastern europe , scandinavia , and north america .

" when anschutz came here , he first put some order in the financial books , and then started building a foundation for the team .
people said it could n't be done here , because of all the problems in the past .
but they were wrong .
we respect tradition and history .
we wouldn ’ t be here if it wasn ’ t for the berlin dynamo , they started the whole thing in 1954 . " pagé says his team has the best , most loyal fans in the german hockey league .
and , in turn , the fans are grateful to him and the eisbären 's contingent of foreign players for giving them back a team they can be proud of .
" the foreign players are the very heart of the team right now , " said oliver , a german hockey enthusiast .

german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .
skilled employees and tomorrow 's experts " do n't just fall from heaven , " said germany 's social democratic education minister edelgard bulmahn -lrb- right -rrb- before friday 's debate and vote in the bundestag . " they must be trained , " she said . the vote passed 300-284 in parliament and does not need approval of the opposition-controlled upper house . the government has been critical of companies that are able of offering traineeships , but do not .
last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines . " we are locked into fragile economic times and issuing threats is n't going to improve the climate for hiring , " martin wansleben , managing director of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told reporters .
" this law is disastrous . " opposition politicians were no more supportive .
guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation . " " this is not a good day for vocational training in germany , " he told the ddp news agency . business or young people first ? but green party parliamentarian grietje bettin criticized opposition politicians for only looking out for the interests of the business community and ignoring the needs of young people in need of training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she said the fine should not be seen as a penalty , but rather as a fair and socially just method to create a balance between companies that do train and those that do not . nicolette kressl of the spd responded to opposition criticism by saying politicians from those parties had not suggested any alternative measures to increase the overall number of traineeships on offer . the move to pass some kind of legislation gained momentum last year , when 35,000 people who sought traineeships failed to find one .
there were 182,000 apprenticeships in total last month , about 27,000 lower than the year before , according to germany 's federal labor agency . in a survey carried out by the university of dortmund , 42 percent of german parents asked said they worried that their child would not find " an appropriate traineeship " after leaving school , up from 32 percent a decade ago .

german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .
skilled employees and tomorrow 's experts " do n't just fall from heaven , " said germany 's social democratic education minister edelgard bulmahn -lrb- right -rrb- before friday 's debate and vote in the bundestag . " they must be trained , " she said . the vote passed 300-284 in parliament and does not need approval of the opposition-controlled upper house . the government has been critical of companies that are able of offering traineeships , but do not .
last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines . " we are locked into fragile economic times and issuing threats is n't going to improve the climate for hiring , " martin wansleben , managing director of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told reporters .
" this law is disastrous . " opposition politicians were no more supportive .
guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation . " " this is not a good day for vocational training in germany , " he told the ddp news agency . business or young people first ? but green party parliamentarian grietje bettin criticized opposition politicians for only looking out for the interests of the business community and ignoring the needs of young people in need of training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she said the fine should not be seen as a penalty , but rather as a fair and socially just method to create a balance between companies that do train and those that do not . nicolette kressl of the spd responded to opposition criticism by saying politicians from those parties had not suggested any alternative measures to increase the overall number of traineeships on offer . the move to pass some kind of legislation gained momentum last year , when 35,000 people who sought traineeships failed to find one .

" the political damage for the usa is so immense , " writes munich 's süddeutsche zeitung , " that even the resignation of donald rumsfeld wo n't even things out . "
but a political victim would send a particularly believable sign that the american government takes seriously its own moral assertions and values that it tries to hold up in iraq .
the paper suggests donald rumsfeld 's resignation would be a sign of humility that has been sorely lacking in him for too long .
for the lübecker nachrichten there 's much to suggest that the pentagon chief donald rumsfeld will be the first to fall over this scandal .
but , adds the paper , even president bush ca n't slip away from personal responsibility .
" that the president in front of arabic television could not even bring himself to say sorry is disgraceful . "
" this gesture was the absolute minimum requirement , " writes the daily , " because now the us which was supposed to stand for freedom and democracy , symbolizes the worst things humans are capable of , brutality , humiliation and inhumanity . "
" this has n't just happened out of the blue , " writes the aachener nachrichten .
" why , then , has the bush administration been so willing to hand over al qaeda suspects captured in afghanistan to other countries ?
the answer is quite simply because their more vigorous interrogation methods will see results .
or if we put it another way , " writes the daily , " because they engage in torture . "
u.s. president george w bush has reacted with shock at the images of torture in iraqi prisons by american soldiers .
but adds the paper , " the question remains whether it 's the torture itself that disturbs the president or the images of the torture ? "
the financial times deutschland writes that the accusations of torture against u.s. soldiers has grown to a barely containable foreign policy issue for the white house and notes that half a year before the presidential elections the topic of iraq is again the central issue .
but the paper doubts that the presidential candidate john kerry will be able to utilize this scandal to his advantage .
the paper believes president bush 's interview on arabic television was designed for an american audience to show he was taking responsibility .
and according to this daily there 's no sign yet that bush will lose the election on the issue of iraq .
the rise in crude oil prices pushing petrol in germany to € 1.20 per liter leaves many papers grumbling .
the mass-circulation bild zeitung writes that at the petrol stations three drivers did n't bother to fill their tanks .

" but the politicians that are chauffeured around for free should realize that germany needs to remain mobile , to transport the millions of commuters and the goods they produce - otherwise the country will be threatened by stoppages and everyone will be poorer , " the paper argues .
the mittelbayerisch zeitung from regensburg disagrees - while the german auto club adac the opposition conservatives and others call for the eco-tax to be dropped – the southern german paper argues that this environmental levy has sensible and long-term goals .
world oil prices will fall again , points out the daily , and dropping the eco levy for two weeks to alleviate higher petrol prices is a short-term solution that will have no impact .

but a political victim would send a particularly believable sign that the american government takes seriously its own moral assertions and values that it tries to hold up in iraq .
the paper suggests donald rumsfeld 's resignation would be a sign of humility that has been sorely lacking in him for too long .
for the lübecker nachrichten there 's much to suggest that the pentagon chief donald rumsfeld will be the first to fall over this scandal .
but , adds the paper , even president bush ca n't slip away from personal responsibility .
" that the president in front of arabic television could not even bring himself to say sorry is disgraceful . "
" this gesture was the absolute minimum requirement , " writes the daily , " because now the us which was supposed to stand for freedom and democracy , symbolizes the worst things humans are capable of , brutality , humiliation and inhumanity . "
" this has n't just happened out of the blue , " writes the aachener nachrichten .
" why , then , has the bush administration been so willing to hand over al qaeda suspects captured in afghanistan to other countries ?
the answer is quite simply because their more vigorous interrogation methods will see results .
or if we put it another way , " writes the daily , " because they engage in torture . "
u.s. president george w bush has reacted with shock at the images of torture in iraqi prisons by american soldiers .
but adds the paper , " the question remains whether it 's the torture itself that disturbs the president or the images of the torture ? "
the financial times deutschland writes that the accusations of torture against u.s. soldiers has grown to a barely containable foreign policy issue for the white house and notes that half a year before the presidential elections the topic of iraq is again the central issue .
but the paper doubts that the presidential candidate john kerry will be able to utilize this scandal to his advantage .
the paper believes president bush 's interview on arabic television was designed for an american audience to show he was taking responsibility .
and according to this daily there 's no sign yet that bush will lose the election on the issue of iraq .
the rise in crude oil prices pushing petrol in germany to € 1.20 per liter leaves many papers grumbling .
the mass-circulation bild zeitung writes that at the petrol stations three drivers did n't bother to fill their tanks .
" everyone 's scrimping and saving , " writes the paper .
" but the politicians that are chauffeured around for free should realize that germany needs to remain mobile , to transport the millions of commuters and the goods they produce - otherwise the country will be threatened by stoppages and everyone will be poorer , " the paper argues .
the mittelbayerisch zeitung from regensburg disagrees - while the german auto club adac the opposition conservatives and others call for the eco-tax to be dropped – the southern german paper argues that this environmental levy has sensible and long-term goals .
world oil prices will fall again , points out the daily , and dropping the eco levy for two weeks to alleviate higher petrol prices is a short-term solution that will have no impact .

deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .
but will the news revive germany 's flagging shareholder culture ? stock market enthusiasts have reason to hope again .
the head of postbank , wulf von schimmelmann , and the executive chairman of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , have big things planned . on june 21 , postbank goes public .
with its clear position as a private bank and a low-risk business model , the credit institute is " fit for the stock market , " said zumwinkel . postbank plans to list up to 50 percent of its equity capital minus one share on the german stock exchange - meaning that deutsche post will remain the majority shareholder .
a price range for the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
experts are already speculating on a price of € 30 per share .
proceeds of about € 3 billion should flow into deutsche post 's coffers as a result of the listing .
the company said it plans to use the money on a stratetgic expansion - among the countries mentioned were austria and denmark .
prognosis positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is the largest private bank in germany .
at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .
and with good reason .
postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .
" the savings deposits alone have climbed by € 1.6 billion , " he said , adding that , last year , the bank managed to triple its net profits in comparison with the previous year .
all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .
shortly before the postbank ipo was announced , the financial times deutschland reported that deutsche bank was aiming for a complete takeover of postbank , and that there 'd already been discussions to that effect with the government .
zumwinkel denies the rumours , though , saying deutsche post intends to be the majority shareholder for the long run . arend wulff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post looks abroad driven by aggressive international expansion , deutsche post reported a profit in 2003 .

deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .
but will the news revive germany 's flagging shareholder culture ? stock market enthusiasts have reason to hope again .
the head of postbank , wulf von schimmelmann , and the executive chairman of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , have big things planned . on june 21 , postbank goes public .
with its clear position as a private bank and a low-risk business model , the credit institute is " fit for the stock market , " said zumwinkel . postbank plans to list up to 50 percent of its equity capital minus one share on the german stock exchange - meaning that deutsche post will remain the majority shareholder .
a price range for the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
experts are already speculating on a price of € 30 per share .
proceeds of about € 3 billion should flow into deutsche post 's coffers as a result of the listing .
the company said it plans to use the money on a stratetgic expansion - among the countries mentioned were austria and denmark .
prognosis positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is the largest private bank in germany .
at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .
and with good reason .
postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .
" the savings deposits alone have climbed by € 1.6 billion , " he said , adding that , last year , the bank managed to triple its net profits in comparison with the previous year .
all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .
shortly before the postbank ipo was announced , the financial times deutschland reported that deutsche bank was aiming for a complete takeover of postbank , and that there 'd already been discussions to that effect with the government .
zumwinkel denies the rumours , though , saying deutsche post intends to be the majority shareholder for the long run . arend wulff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post looks abroad driven by aggressive international expansion , deutsche post reported a profit in 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.05.2004 european press review : the consequences of prisoner abuse in iraq the focus of much of the comment in european papers on friday was the abuse of iraqi prisoners by their american guards and rising gasoline prices . the dutch algemeen dagblad looks at the consequences of the reports of torture in iraq by u.s. and british troops .
the damage done by this behavior is enormous , the paper wrote .
the scandal for the rest of the world confirms that the united states has taken on more than it can handle in iraq .
the paper said george w. bush will have to make a sacrifice in washington and the most prominent victim could be the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld . italy ’ s corriere della sera agreed , but added that there is more than rumsfeld ’ s scalp at stake .
the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .
but , the paper points out , he only earns one or two cents a liter .
the oil companies take about 15 cents and the oil sheikhs earn 18 cents a liter .

the damage done by this behavior is enormous , the paper wrote .
the scandal for the rest of the world confirms that the united states has taken on more than it can handle in iraq .
the paper said george w. bush will have to make a sacrifice in washington and the most prominent victim could be the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld . italy ’ s corriere della sera agreed , but added that there is more than rumsfeld ’ s scalp at stake .
the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .
but , the paper points out , he only earns one or two cents a liter .
the oil companies take about 15 cents and the oil sheikhs earn 18 cents a liter .

dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .

there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .

speaking to journalists in brussels on friday , negotiators from both sides were positive about the prospects of forging a deal , although they were both keen to point out that there was much work still to be done .
eu trade representative said that long awaited offers on market access could be tabled in the coming days .
the offers had been due to come last month but were delayed , with access for agricultural products and tariffs in that area among the issues holding things up .
eu officials this week made it known that they are ready to improve market access for mercosur 's agricultural producers , a move which apparently unblocked the impasse .
the bloc , which comprises argentina , brazil , uruguay and paraguay , has been in negotiations with the eu since 2000 .

the shoe will adjust to changing conditions and the runner 's particular style while in use .

the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details . four days after the green party pulled out of crucial immigration talks with the conservative opposition - prompting talk of a government crisis - germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens have agreed to bury differences and search for common ground on continuing negotiations . following a government summit meeting in chancellor schröder 's office on friday , representatives from the two parties said they had reached a compromise , according to which the chancellor will hold special meetings with the conservative opposition of christian democrats and its sister party , the christian social union , to determine whether there were any chances for a all-party accord on a new immigration law . but , in the end it would be up to a government committee to decide whether immigration negotiations with the conservative opposition should continue .
the new immigration law is in effect designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and facilitate companies to recruit skilled staff from abroad . the government summit meeting on friday agreed on a declaration in which they accused the opposition christian democrats of blocking talks thus far .

" conservatives make security issue a priority the latest crisis in the immigration debate came after the greens abandoned talks on monday , saying the conservative opposition was hell-bent on including anti-terrorism measures in the immigration package - a move the greens believe has nothing to do with immigration directly and was blocking all other issues . " we do n't believe that we can come to a responsible solution with the christian democrats , " bütikofer told daily tagesspiegel on thursday . the christian democrats insist - in light of the recent terrorist attacks in madrid - that an accord on the immigration law hinges on reaching agreement on important internal security issues .
the conservatives want a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and participate in violent demonstrations as well as the expulsion of persons who preach hate and violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , they want to deport foreigners sentenced to more than a year in prison , set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . government might go it alone schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . but in light of pressure from business and industry keen to hire skilled personnel from abroad and germany 's rapidly ageing population that needs young workers to keep the social services from collapsing , the government has indicated that it might go it alone with the immigration law if the conservatives do n't fall in line . it would thus seek parliamentary approval for clauses in the immigration law that do n't need the support of the opposition-dominated upper house , which represents germany 's federal states . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens abandon german immigration talks germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .

prodi ’ s comments could signal a shift in geopolitical focus - a move to diversify away from the transatlantic partnership that has traditionally been seen as europe ’ s most important trade relationship .
during a visit to brussels by chinese premier wen jiabao , prodi said he " would bet that the eu-china trade relationship will be the single biggest in the world . "
eu-us ties currently top the world ’ s bilateral trade league and have a turnover of about € 240 billion each year .
to reach this level eu-china trade would have to almost double .
after thursday 's meeting , both prodi and the chinese premier were keen to drive home how much the relationship is growing , pointing to the five trade and technology agreements signed today by the two sides as examples .
both men described the relationship as " a strategic partnership " and wen called for " a strategic dialogue to further bilateral relations . "
to that end prodi announced thursday that officials will be drawing up ideas for a " completely new agreement " between the eu and china to reflect what he called " the new level of relations . "

speaking to journalists in brussels on friday , negotiators from both sides were positive about the prospects of forging a deal , although they were both keen to point out that there was much work still to be done .
eu trade representative said that long awaited offers on market access could be tabled in the coming days .
the offers had been due to come last month but were delayed , with access for agricultural products and tariffs in that area among the issues holding things up .
eu officials this week made it known that they are ready to improve market access for mercosur 's agricultural producers , a move which apparently unblocked the impasse .
the bloc , which comprises argentina , brazil , uruguay and paraguay , has been in negotiations with the eu since 2000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.05.2004 germany passes controversial traineeship law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , companies will have to offer traineeships - or pay up .
german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .
skilled employees and tomorrow 's experts " do n't just fall from heaven , " said germany 's social democratic education minister edelgard bulmahn -lrb- right -rrb- before friday 's debate and vote in the bundestag . " they must be trained , " she said . the vote passed 300-284 in parliament and does not need approval of the opposition-controlled upper house . the government has been critical of companies that are able of offering traineeships , but do not .
last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines . " we are locked into fragile economic times and issuing threats is n't going to improve the climate for hiring , " martin wansleben , managing director of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told reporters .
" this law is disastrous . " opposition politicians were no more supportive .
guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation . " " this is not a good day for vocational training in germany , " he told the ddp news agency . business or young people first ? but green party parliamentarian grietje bettin criticized opposition politicians for only looking out for the interests of the business community and ignoring the needs of young people in need of training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she said the fine should not be seen as a penalty , but rather as a fair and socially just method to create a balance between companies that do train and those that do not . nicolette kressl of the spd responded to opposition criticism by saying politicians from those parties had not suggested any alternative measures to increase the overall number of traineeships on offer . the move to pass some kind of legislation gained momentum last year , when 35,000 people who sought traineeships failed to find one .
there were 182,000 apprenticeships in total last month , about 27,000 lower than the year before , according to germany 's federal labor agency . in a survey carried out by the university of dortmund , 42 percent of german parents asked said they worried that their child would not find " an appropriate traineeship " after leaving school , up from 32 percent a decade ago .
in the eastern part of germany , 24 percent were against the imposition of fines on companies which did not sufficiently train .
in western germany , only 19 percent were against such a system . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder gets tough on traineeship deficit german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo .

german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .
skilled employees and tomorrow 's experts " do n't just fall from heaven , " said germany 's social democratic education minister edelgard bulmahn -lrb- right -rrb- before friday 's debate and vote in the bundestag . " they must be trained , " she said . the vote passed 300-284 in parliament and does not need approval of the opposition-controlled upper house . the government has been critical of companies that are able of offering traineeships , but do not .
last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines . " we are locked into fragile economic times and issuing threats is n't going to improve the climate for hiring , " martin wansleben , managing director of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told reporters .
" this law is disastrous . " opposition politicians were no more supportive .
guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation . " " this is not a good day for vocational training in germany , " he told the ddp news agency . business or young people first ? but green party parliamentarian grietje bettin criticized opposition politicians for only looking out for the interests of the business community and ignoring the needs of young people in need of training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she said the fine should not be seen as a penalty , but rather as a fair and socially just method to create a balance between companies that do train and those that do not . nicolette kressl of the spd responded to opposition criticism by saying politicians from those parties had not suggested any alternative measures to increase the overall number of traineeships on offer . the move to pass some kind of legislation gained momentum last year , when 35,000 people who sought traineeships failed to find one .
there were 182,000 apprenticeships in total last month , about 27,000 lower than the year before , according to germany 's federal labor agency . in a survey carried out by the university of dortmund , 42 percent of german parents asked said they worried that their child would not find " an appropriate traineeship " after leaving school , up from 32 percent a decade ago .
in the eastern part of germany , 24 percent were against the imposition of fines on companies which did not sufficiently train .
in western germany , only 19 percent were against such a system . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder gets tough on traineeship deficit german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo .

" the political damage for the usa is so immense , " writes munich 's süddeutsche zeitung , " that even the resignation of donald rumsfeld wo n't even things out . "
but a political victim would send a particularly believable sign that the american government takes seriously its own moral assertions and values that it tries to hold up in iraq .
the paper suggests donald rumsfeld 's resignation would be a sign of humility that has been sorely lacking in him for too long .
for the lübecker nachrichten there 's much to suggest that the pentagon chief donald rumsfeld will be the first to fall over this scandal .
but , adds the paper , even president bush ca n't slip away from personal responsibility .
" that the president in front of arabic television could not even bring himself to say sorry is disgraceful . "
" this gesture was the absolute minimum requirement , " writes the daily , " because now the us which was supposed to stand for freedom and democracy , symbolizes the worst things humans are capable of , brutality , humiliation and inhumanity . "
" this has n't just happened out of the blue , " writes the aachener nachrichten .
" why , then , has the bush administration been so willing to hand over al qaeda suspects captured in afghanistan to other countries ?
the answer is quite simply because their more vigorous interrogation methods will see results .
or if we put it another way , " writes the daily , " because they engage in torture . "
u.s. president george w bush has reacted with shock at the images of torture in iraqi prisons by american soldiers .
but adds the paper , " the question remains whether it 's the torture itself that disturbs the president or the images of the torture ? "
the financial times deutschland writes that the accusations of torture against u.s. soldiers has grown to a barely containable foreign policy issue for the white house and notes that half a year before the presidential elections the topic of iraq is again the central issue .
but the paper doubts that the presidential candidate john kerry will be able to utilize this scandal to his advantage .
the paper believes president bush 's interview on arabic television was designed for an american audience to show he was taking responsibility .
and according to this daily there 's no sign yet that bush will lose the election on the issue of iraq .

" but the politicians that are chauffeured around for free should realize that germany needs to remain mobile , to transport the millions of commuters and the goods they produce - otherwise the country will be threatened by stoppages and everyone will be poorer , " the paper argues .

amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.05.2004 mobile phone carriers feel the heat from low-cost rivals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-cost providers are likely to introduce bargain-basement phone rates across europe .
big european mobile phone carriers are now facing a headache big airlines have already confronted : low-cost competition .
the mobile phone equivalents of ryanair and easyjet are promising to shake up the market . it was probably only a question of time until some enterprising businessperson saw the possibilities in emulating the successful model of the low-cost air carriers .
while ryanair , german wings and hapag-lloyd have undercut the giants of the aviation industry and forced them to radically reevaluate how they do business , mobile phone upstarts like denmark 's telmore are doing the same in its own sector . after years of growth , the european mobile phone market is saturated , since already 80 percent of europeans already own mobile phones .
mobile phone service providers can not count on basing future business strategies on winning new customers .
they are n't there to be had . " in the next few years , a segmentation of the market is going to take place , similar to what we 've seen with the airlines , " roman friedrich , telecoms analyst at the consulting firm booz allen hamilton deutschland , told dw-world .
he said according to studies his firm has carried out , the european mobile phone market is standing just before a turning point . " by the end of the year in europe there will several low-cost providers and in two years at the most , in almost every country there will be at least one big low-cost operator , " he said . up to 60 percent cheaper it 's likely that low-cost mobile phone providers will find the same enthusiastic reception as europe 's low-cost air carriers have .
friedrich estimates that up to 20 percent of mobile phone users could switch to low-cost carriers . for those who use their mobile phones for just telephoning and have little interest in high-tech extras or service hotlines , low-cost providers are an attractive alternative .
prices can run from 30 to 40 percent under those charged by the big carriers , or in some cases , up to 60 percent . those however who put value on having the newest , sleekest phone on the market in their purse or pocket and want to play games , get news , or download music and videos will be disappointed .
the low-cost players , according to friedrich , dispense with anything that involves higher operating expenses or development costs . danish success several danish low-cost firms , telmore and cbb mobil , have managed to give big carriers a few sleepless nights with their success .
the two have acquired 43.7 percent of all new mobile customers from 2000 to 2003 .
today , more than 20 percent of mobile customers are using a discount mobile service provider . the developments in denmark have led the mobile phone providers across europe , even in countries without low-cost players , to consider what their future strategies should be .
some are considering offering their own inexpensive plans or creating subsidiaries to try to beat the arrival of the low-cost competition - an event that the big firms say is a given . " after telmore several companies , such as tele.ring in austria and sunrise in switzerland as good candidates for restructuring into low-cost carriers , " said friedrich .
" in sweden and the netherlands there are several companies currently in the starting blocks . " in germany , new providers are sure to mix up the mobile telephony landscape .
the current market structure , two large and two small providers , is considered by the sector to be unstable and nearly predestined for the entry of one or more low-cost carriers .
the only question companies are asking is who will make the first step . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de third generation mobile phones arrive in germany it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany .

it was n't that the fans were surprised that their team made it to the finals .
the eisbären had been riding high all season thanks to a line-up of experienced foreign players and young german talent .
but national success is still relatively new for the former east german team .
today , it 's one of the few sports teams from the old gdr that 's risen to the top of the league in reunified germany .
in recent years , the eisbären have even outplayed the west berlin team , the berlin capitals . " it ’ s really something that the eisbären are doing so well now , " local sports journalist klaus weiser told dw-world .
" they ’ re a bit of a cult team , with a long tradition , they ’ ve always been really popular in east berlin .
they were the east german champions 15 times , and after reunification when they played nationally with western teams , they were among the worst , always at the bottom .
but the stadium was always full , and the fans have always been behind them . ” champions of world 's smallest league it ’ s true that the eisbären were at the top of their league in east germany .
but that ’ s not too difficult when the league only has two teams .
the lack of funds for hockey in the gdr meant the eisbären , then known as dynamo berlin , faced off over and over against the only other team in the country , dynamo whitewater .
the players knew each other ’ s style inside out , down to the way they laced up their skates . in 1990 , following german reunification , the eisbären placed a dismal 11th in the national league .
five years later , they were in 17th place .
then , in 1996 , salvation came in the bosman ruling , a court decision which allowed the unlimited employment of foreign players .
the eisbären were one of the first hockey teams to take advantage of the ruling , swapping almost their entire team for talented imports from eastern europe , scandinavia , and north america .
that season , they placed fourth . billionaire investor , foreign players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eisbärens ' logo another stroke of luck came in 1999 , when billionaire american businessman philip anschutz bought the team .
a short while later , he hired the team ’ s current coach , canadian pierre pagé , formerly the coach of such national hockey league -lrb- nhl -rrb- teams as the calgary flames and the anaheim mighty ducks . " it starts with a vision , " pagé said .
" when anschutz came here , he first put some order in the financial books , and then started building a foundation for the team .
people said it could n't be done here , because of all the problems in the past .
but they were wrong .
we respect tradition and history .
we wouldn ’ t be here if it wasn ’ t for the berlin dynamo , they started the whole thing in 1954 . " pagé says his team has the best , most loyal fans in the german hockey league .
and , in turn , the fans are grateful to him and the eisbären 's contingent of foreign players for giving them back a team they can be proud of .
" the foreign players are the very heart of the team right now , " said oliver , a german hockey enthusiast .
" in particular , the players from canada and the u.s. - those with nhl experience - have brought over a lot of know-how , they ’ ve lifted the quality of the game , and that ’ s reflected in the growing level of public interest in the sport . " the eisbären are attracting more fans now that they ’ re winning games .
but their fan base will always be rooted in east berlin , with the people who understand what the team has been through . while the eisbären have learned how to succeed in the new germany , many of their east berlin fans are still struggling .
" a lot of the fans here are unemployed , " said one devoted follower .
" going to a game offers them an escape from everyday life .
you can just forget about your problems for a while .
it 's a different world inside the arena .

" the political damage for the usa is so immense , " writes munich 's süddeutsche zeitung , " that even the resignation of donald rumsfeld wo n't even things out . "
but a political victim would send a particularly believable sign that the american government takes seriously its own moral assertions and values that it tries to hold up in iraq .
the paper suggests donald rumsfeld 's resignation would be a sign of humility that has been sorely lacking in him for too long .
for the lübecker nachrichten there 's much to suggest that the pentagon chief donald rumsfeld will be the first to fall over this scandal .
but , adds the paper , even president bush ca n't slip away from personal responsibility .
" that the president in front of arabic television could not even bring himself to say sorry is disgraceful . "
" this gesture was the absolute minimum requirement , " writes the daily , " because now the us which was supposed to stand for freedom and democracy , symbolizes the worst things humans are capable of , brutality , humiliation and inhumanity . "
" this has n't just happened out of the blue , " writes the aachener nachrichten .
" why , then , has the bush administration been so willing to hand over al qaeda suspects captured in afghanistan to other countries ?
the answer is quite simply because their more vigorous interrogation methods will see results .
or if we put it another way , " writes the daily , " because they engage in torture . "
u.s. president george w bush has reacted with shock at the images of torture in iraqi prisons by american soldiers .
but adds the paper , " the question remains whether it 's the torture itself that disturbs the president or the images of the torture ? "
the financial times deutschland writes that the accusations of torture against u.s. soldiers has grown to a barely containable foreign policy issue for the white house and notes that half a year before the presidential elections the topic of iraq is again the central issue .
but the paper doubts that the presidential candidate john kerry will be able to utilize this scandal to his advantage .
the paper believes president bush 's interview on arabic television was designed for an american audience to show he was taking responsibility .
and according to this daily there 's no sign yet that bush will lose the election on the issue of iraq .
the rise in crude oil prices pushing petrol in germany to € 1.20 per liter leaves many papers grumbling .
the mass-circulation bild zeitung writes that at the petrol stations three drivers did n't bother to fill their tanks .
" everyone 's scrimping and saving , " writes the paper .
" but the politicians that are chauffeured around for free should realize that germany needs to remain mobile , to transport the millions of commuters and the goods they produce - otherwise the country will be threatened by stoppages and everyone will be poorer , " the paper argues .
the mittelbayerisch zeitung from regensburg disagrees - while the german auto club adac the opposition conservatives and others call for the eco-tax to be dropped – the southern german paper argues that this environmental levy has sensible and long-term goals .
world oil prices will fall again , points out the daily , and dropping the eco levy for two weeks to alleviate higher petrol prices is a short-term solution that will have no impact .

the financial times deutschland writes that the accusations of torture against u.s. soldiers has grown to a barely containable foreign policy issue for the white house and notes that half a year before the presidential elections the topic of iraq is again the central issue .
but the paper doubts that the presidential candidate john kerry will be able to utilize this scandal to his advantage .
the paper believes president bush 's interview on arabic television was designed for an american audience to show he was taking responsibility .
and according to this daily there 's no sign yet that bush will lose the election on the issue of iraq .
the rise in crude oil prices pushing petrol in germany to € 1.20 per liter leaves many papers grumbling .
the mass-circulation bild zeitung writes that at the petrol stations three drivers did n't bother to fill their tanks .
" everyone 's scrimping and saving , " writes the paper .
" but the politicians that are chauffeured around for free should realize that germany needs to remain mobile , to transport the millions of commuters and the goods they produce - otherwise the country will be threatened by stoppages and everyone will be poorer , " the paper argues .
the mittelbayerisch zeitung from regensburg disagrees - while the german auto club adac the opposition conservatives and others call for the eco-tax to be dropped – the southern german paper argues that this environmental levy has sensible and long-term goals .
world oil prices will fall again , points out the daily , and dropping the eco levy for two weeks to alleviate higher petrol prices is a short-term solution that will have no impact .

it was n't that the fans were surprised that their team made it to the finals .
the eisbären had been riding high all season thanks to a line-up of experienced foreign players and young german talent .
but national success is still relatively new for the former east german team .
today , it 's one of the few sports teams from the old gdr that 's risen to the top of the league in reunified germany .
in recent years , the eisbären have even outplayed the west berlin team , the berlin capitals . " it ’ s really something that the eisbären are doing so well now , " local sports journalist klaus weiser told dw-world .
" they ’ re a bit of a cult team , with a long tradition , they ’ ve always been really popular in east berlin .
they were the east german champions 15 times , and after reunification when they played nationally with western teams , they were among the worst , always at the bottom .
but the stadium was always full , and the fans have always been behind them . ” champions of world 's smallest league it ’ s true that the eisbären were at the top of their league in east germany .
but that ’ s not too difficult when the league only has two teams .
the lack of funds for hockey in the gdr meant the eisbären , then known as dynamo berlin , faced off over and over against the only other team in the country , dynamo whitewater .
the players knew each other ’ s style inside out , down to the way they laced up their skates . in 1990 , following german reunification , the eisbären placed a dismal 11th in the national league .
five years later , they were in 17th place .
then , in 1996 , salvation came in the bosman ruling , a court decision which allowed the unlimited employment of foreign players .
the eisbären were one of the first hockey teams to take advantage of the ruling , swapping almost their entire team for talented imports from eastern europe , scandinavia , and north america .
that season , they placed fourth . billionaire investor , foreign players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eisbärens ' logo another stroke of luck came in 1999 , when billionaire american businessman philip anschutz bought the team .
a short while later , he hired the team ’ s current coach , canadian pierre pagé , formerly the coach of such national hockey league -lrb- nhl -rrb- teams as the calgary flames and the anaheim mighty ducks . " it starts with a vision , " pagé said .
" when anschutz came here , he first put some order in the financial books , and then started building a foundation for the team .
people said it could n't be done here , because of all the problems in the past .
but they were wrong .
we respect tradition and history .
we wouldn ’ t be here if it wasn ’ t for the berlin dynamo , they started the whole thing in 1954 . " pagé says his team has the best , most loyal fans in the german hockey league .
and , in turn , the fans are grateful to him and the eisbären 's contingent of foreign players for giving them back a team they can be proud of .
" the foreign players are the very heart of the team right now , " said oliver , a german hockey enthusiast .
" in particular , the players from canada and the u.s. - those with nhl experience - have brought over a lot of know-how , they ’ ve lifted the quality of the game , and that ’ s reflected in the growing level of public interest in the sport . " the eisbären are attracting more fans now that they ’ re winning games .
but their fan base will always be rooted in east berlin , with the people who understand what the team has been through . while the eisbären have learned how to succeed in the new germany , many of their east berlin fans are still struggling .
" a lot of the fans here are unemployed , " said one devoted follower .
" going to a game offers them an escape from everyday life .
you can just forget about your problems for a while .
it 's a different world inside the arena .

deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .
but will the news revive germany 's flagging shareholder culture ? stock market enthusiasts have reason to hope again .
the head of postbank , wulf von schimmelmann , and the executive chairman of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , have big things planned . on june 21 , postbank goes public .
with its clear position as a private bank and a low-risk business model , the credit institute is " fit for the stock market , " said zumwinkel . postbank plans to list up to 50 percent of its equity capital minus one share on the german stock exchange - meaning that deutsche post will remain the majority shareholder .
a price range for the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
experts are already speculating on a price of € 30 per share .
proceeds of about € 3 billion should flow into deutsche post 's coffers as a result of the listing .
the company said it plans to use the money on a stratetgic expansion - among the countries mentioned were austria and denmark .
prognosis positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is the largest private bank in germany .
at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .
and with good reason .
postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .
" the savings deposits alone have climbed by € 1.6 billion , " he said , adding that , last year , the bank managed to triple its net profits in comparison with the previous year .
all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .
shortly before the postbank ipo was announced , the financial times deutschland reported that deutsche bank was aiming for a complete takeover of postbank , and that there 'd already been discussions to that effect with the government .

deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .
but will the news revive germany 's flagging shareholder culture ? stock market enthusiasts have reason to hope again .
the head of postbank , wulf von schimmelmann , and the executive chairman of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , have big things planned . on june 21 , postbank goes public .
with its clear position as a private bank and a low-risk business model , the credit institute is " fit for the stock market , " said zumwinkel . postbank plans to list up to 50 percent of its equity capital minus one share on the german stock exchange - meaning that deutsche post will remain the majority shareholder .
a price range for the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
experts are already speculating on a price of € 30 per share .
proceeds of about € 3 billion should flow into deutsche post 's coffers as a result of the listing .
the company said it plans to use the money on a stratetgic expansion - among the countries mentioned were austria and denmark .
prognosis positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is the largest private bank in germany .
at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .
and with good reason .
postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .
" the savings deposits alone have climbed by € 1.6 billion , " he said , adding that , last year , the bank managed to triple its net profits in comparison with the previous year .
all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .

the damage done by this behavior is enormous , the paper wrote .
the scandal for the rest of the world confirms that the united states has taken on more than it can handle in iraq .
the paper said george w. bush will have to make a sacrifice in washington and the most prominent victim could be the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld . italy ’ s corriere della sera agreed , but added that there is more than rumsfeld ’ s scalp at stake .
the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .
but , the paper points out , he only earns one or two cents a liter .

the damage done by this behavior is enormous , the paper wrote .
the scandal for the rest of the world confirms that the united states has taken on more than it can handle in iraq .
the paper said george w. bush will have to make a sacrifice in washington and the most prominent victim could be the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld . italy ’ s corriere della sera agreed , but added that there is more than rumsfeld ’ s scalp at stake .
the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .
but , the paper points out , he only earns one or two cents a liter .

but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .
but , the paper points out , he only earns one or two cents a liter .
the oil companies take about 15 cents and the oil sheikhs earn 18 cents a liter .
the other 80-odd cents , the paper concluded , goes into the coffers of the german government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .

and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .

the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details . four days after the green party pulled out of crucial immigration talks with the conservative opposition - prompting talk of a government crisis - germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens have agreed to bury differences and search for common ground on continuing negotiations . following a government summit meeting in chancellor schröder 's office on friday , representatives from the two parties said they had reached a compromise , according to which the chancellor will hold special meetings with the conservative opposition of christian democrats and its sister party , the christian social union , to determine whether there were any chances for a all-party accord on a new immigration law . but , in the end it would be up to a government committee to decide whether immigration negotiations with the conservative opposition should continue .
the new immigration law is in effect designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and facilitate companies to recruit skilled staff from abroad . the government summit meeting on friday agreed on a declaration in which they accused the opposition christian democrats of blocking talks thus far .

the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details . four days after the green party pulled out of crucial immigration talks with the conservative opposition - prompting talk of a government crisis - germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens have agreed to bury differences and search for common ground on continuing negotiations . following a government summit meeting in chancellor schröder 's office on friday , representatives from the two parties said they had reached a compromise , according to which the chancellor will hold special meetings with the conservative opposition of christian democrats and its sister party , the christian social union , to determine whether there were any chances for a all-party accord on a new immigration law . but , in the end it would be up to a government committee to decide whether immigration negotiations with the conservative opposition should continue .
the new immigration law is in effect designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and facilitate companies to recruit skilled staff from abroad . the government summit meeting on friday agreed on a declaration in which they accused the opposition christian democrats of blocking talks thus far .
the declaration also stressed that to avoid the immigration law from " becoming an instrument in election campaigns , " the decision on further talks would be taken before the european elections on june 13 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader reinhard bütikofer spd chairman franz müntefering said on friday , " a common law is the priority . " green party chief reinhard bütikofer -lrb- photo -rrb- emphasized that it was important that further negotiations with the opposition were marked by a " clear timetable " and a " clear alternative . " conservatives make security issue a priority the latest crisis in the immigration debate came after the greens abandoned talks on monday , saying the conservative opposition was hell-bent on including anti-terrorism measures in the immigration package - a move the greens believe has nothing to do with immigration directly and was blocking all other issues . " we do n't believe that we can come to a responsible solution with the christian democrats , " bütikofer told daily tagesspiegel on thursday . the christian democrats insist - in light of the recent terrorist attacks in madrid - that an accord on the immigration law hinges on reaching agreement on important internal security issues .
the conservatives want a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and participate in violent demonstrations as well as the expulsion of persons who preach hate and violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , they want to deport foreigners sentenced to more than a year in prison , set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . government might go it alone schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . but in light of pressure from business and industry keen to hire skilled personnel from abroad and germany 's rapidly ageing population that needs young workers to keep the social services from collapsing , the government has indicated that it might go it alone with the immigration law if the conservatives do n't fall in line . it would thus seek parliamentary approval for clauses in the immigration law that do n't need the support of the opposition-dominated upper house , which represents germany 's federal states . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens abandon german immigration talks germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .

german politicians say berlin missed a great chance at publicity after the parliament refused to allow hollywood star tom cruise to shoot " mission impossible 3 " in berlin 's historic reichstag building . a month after tom cruise arrived in berlin to check out possible locations for the third part of his spy thriller " mission impossible " - the hollywood hunk has been given the cold shoulder by the german parliament . cruise was apparently fascinated by the reichstag 's spectacular glass dome and wanted to shoot there .
but the idea of a hollywood crew trampling through the hallowed corridors of the seat of german democracy was , it seems , too much for parliamentary president wolfgang thierse to bear . earlier this week , he shot down cruise 's wish .
" it 's about preserving the dignity of the parliament , " thierse 's spokesman hans hotter said . but the issue continued to simmer on thursday after politicians from the greens and free democrats bemoaned thierse 's decision .
the parliamentarians said germany had missed a chance to raise its international profile .
" it 's great if such films do n't just play against the backdrop of los angeles or new york , but also in berlin or paris , " greens deputy floor leader volker beck said . " if such a blockbuster can make the reichstag building an international star , then the parliament should n't be so parochial , " free democrats chief guido westerwelle said , adding it was a " brilliant chance to spark worldwide interest in berlin and to lure visitors to germany . " president of berlin 's city-state parliament , walter momper insisted that cruise could still film in berlin and offered his own office , the former prussian assembly building , as an alternative location .
" mr cruise should show us the screenplay , and if it fits with the dignity of the building , then he can film here by paying a small fee , " momper told daily berliner kurier . but , as it turns out , the outcry may be hugely overestimating what 's at stake .
a source at the babelsberg film studios near potsdam told news magazine spiegel that all director joe carnahan wanted was to " shoot a really simple dialogue scene in the dome of the reichstag , " not a sophisticated one with special effects and the works . babelsberg spokesman felix neunzerling too added it was n't a big deal .
" naturally you can also simply build a copy of the dome , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .
skilled employees and tomorrow 's experts " do n't just fall from heaven , " said germany 's social democratic education minister edelgard bulmahn -lrb- right -rrb- before friday 's debate and vote in the bundestag . " they must be trained , " she said . the vote passed 300-284 in parliament and does not need approval of the opposition-controlled upper house . the government has been critical of companies that are able of offering traineeships , but do not .
last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines .

guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation .

there were 182,000 apprenticeships in total last month , about 27,000 lower than the year before , according to germany 's federal labor agency . in a survey carried out by the university of dortmund , 42 percent of german parents asked said they worried that their child would not find " an appropriate traineeship " after leaving school , up from 32 percent a decade ago .

german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .
skilled employees and tomorrow 's experts " do n't just fall from heaven , " said germany 's social democratic education minister edelgard bulmahn -lrb- right -rrb- before friday 's debate and vote in the bundestag . " they must be trained , " she said . the vote passed 300-284 in parliament and does not need approval of the opposition-controlled upper house . the government has been critical of companies that are able of offering traineeships , but do not .
last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines . " we are locked into fragile economic times and issuing threats is n't going to improve the climate for hiring , " martin wansleben , managing director of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told reporters .
" this law is disastrous . " opposition politicians were no more supportive .
guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation .

there were 182,000 apprenticeships in total last month , about 27,000 lower than the year before , according to germany 's federal labor agency . in a survey carried out by the university of dortmund , 42 percent of german parents asked said they worried that their child would not find " an appropriate traineeship " after leaving school , up from 32 percent a decade ago .
in the eastern part of germany , 24 percent were against the imposition of fines on companies which did not sufficiently train .

it was n't that the fans were surprised that their team made it to the finals .
the eisbären had been riding high all season thanks to a line-up of experienced foreign players and young german talent .
but national success is still relatively new for the former east german team .
today , it 's one of the few sports teams from the old gdr that 's risen to the top of the league in reunified germany .
in recent years , the eisbären have even outplayed the west berlin team , the berlin capitals . " it ’ s really something that the eisbären are doing so well now , " local sports journalist klaus weiser told dw-world .
" they ’ re a bit of a cult team , with a long tradition , they ’ ve always been really popular in east berlin .
they were the east german champions 15 times , and after reunification when they played nationally with western teams , they were among the worst , always at the bottom .
but the stadium was always full , and the fans have always been behind them . ” champions of world 's smallest league it ’ s true that the eisbären were at the top of their league in east germany .
but that ’ s not too difficult when the league only has two teams .
the lack of funds for hockey in the gdr meant the eisbären , then known as dynamo berlin , faced off over and over against the only other team in the country , dynamo whitewater .
the players knew each other ’ s style inside out , down to the way they laced up their skates . in 1990 , following german reunification , the eisbären placed a dismal 11th in the national league .
five years later , they were in 17th place .
then , in 1996 , salvation came in the bosman ruling , a court decision which allowed the unlimited employment of foreign players .
the eisbären were one of the first hockey teams to take advantage of the ruling , swapping almost their entire team for talented imports from eastern europe , scandinavia , and north america .
that season , they placed fourth . billionaire investor , foreign players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eisbärens ' logo another stroke of luck came in 1999 , when billionaire american businessman philip anschutz bought the team .
a short while later , he hired the team ’ s current coach , canadian pierre pagé , formerly the coach of such national hockey league -lrb- nhl -rrb- teams as the calgary flames and the anaheim mighty ducks . " it starts with a vision , " pagé said .
" when anschutz came here , he first put some order in the financial books , and then started building a foundation for the team .
people said it could n't be done here , because of all the problems in the past .
but they were wrong .
we respect tradition and history .
we wouldn ’ t be here if it wasn ’ t for the berlin dynamo , they started the whole thing in 1954 . " pagé says his team has the best , most loyal fans in the german hockey league .
and , in turn , the fans are grateful to him and the eisbären 's contingent of foreign players for giving them back a team they can be proud of .
" the foreign players are the very heart of the team right now , " said oliver , a german hockey enthusiast .
" in particular , the players from canada and the u.s. - those with nhl experience - have brought over a lot of know-how , they ’ ve lifted the quality of the game , and that ’ s reflected in the growing level of public interest in the sport . " the eisbären are attracting more fans now that they ’ re winning games .
but their fan base will always be rooted in east berlin , with the people who understand what the team has been through . while the eisbären have learned how to succeed in the new germany , many of their east berlin fans are still struggling .
" a lot of the fans here are unemployed , " said one devoted follower .
" going to a game offers them an escape from everyday life .
you can just forget about your problems for a while .
it 's a different world inside the arena .

german politicians say berlin missed a great chance at publicity after the parliament refused to allow hollywood star tom cruise to shoot " mission impossible 3 " in berlin 's historic reichstag building . a month after tom cruise arrived in berlin to check out possible locations for the third part of his spy thriller " mission impossible " - the hollywood hunk has been given the cold shoulder by the german parliament . cruise was apparently fascinated by the reichstag 's spectacular glass dome and wanted to shoot there .
but the idea of a hollywood crew trampling through the hallowed corridors of the seat of german democracy was , it seems , too much for parliamentary president wolfgang thierse to bear . earlier this week , he shot down cruise 's wish .
" it 's about preserving the dignity of the parliament , " thierse 's spokesman hans hotter said . but the issue continued to simmer on thursday after politicians from the greens and free democrats bemoaned thierse 's decision .
the parliamentarians said germany had missed a chance to raise its international profile .
" it 's great if such films do n't just play against the backdrop of los angeles or new york , but also in berlin or paris , " greens deputy floor leader volker beck said . " if such a blockbuster can make the reichstag building an international star , then the parliament should n't be so parochial , " free democrats chief guido westerwelle said , adding it was a " brilliant chance to spark worldwide interest in berlin and to lure visitors to germany . " president of berlin 's city-state parliament , walter momper insisted that cruise could still film in berlin and offered his own office , the former prussian assembly building , as an alternative location .
" mr cruise should show us the screenplay , and if it fits with the dignity of the building , then he can film here by paying a small fee , " momper told daily berliner kurier . but , as it turns out , the outcry may be hugely overestimating what 's at stake .
a source at the babelsberg film studios near potsdam told news magazine spiegel that all director joe carnahan wanted was to " shoot a really simple dialogue scene in the dome of the reichstag , " not a sophisticated one with special effects and the works . babelsberg spokesman felix neunzerling too added it was n't a big deal .

big european mobile phone carriers are now facing a headache big airlines have already confronted : low-cost competition .
the mobile phone equivalents of ryanair and easyjet are promising to shake up the market . it was probably only a question of time until some enterprising businessperson saw the possibilities in emulating the successful model of the low-cost air carriers .
while ryanair , german wings and hapag-lloyd have undercut the giants of the aviation industry and forced them to radically reevaluate how they do business , mobile phone upstarts like denmark 's telmore are doing the same in its own sector . after years of growth , the european mobile phone market is saturated , since already 80 percent of europeans already own mobile phones .
mobile phone service providers can not count on basing future business strategies on winning new customers .
they are n't there to be had . " in the next few years , a segmentation of the market is going to take place , similar to what we 've seen with the airlines , " roman friedrich , telecoms analyst at the consulting firm booz allen hamilton deutschland , told dw-world .
he said according to studies his firm has carried out , the european mobile phone market is standing just before a turning point . " by the end of the year in europe there will several low-cost providers and in two years at the most , in almost every country there will be at least one big low-cost operator , " he said . up to 60 percent cheaper it 's likely that low-cost mobile phone providers will find the same enthusiastic reception as europe 's low-cost air carriers have .
friedrich estimates that up to 20 percent of mobile phone users could switch to low-cost carriers . for those who use their mobile phones for just telephoning and have little interest in high-tech extras or service hotlines , low-cost providers are an attractive alternative .
prices can run from 30 to 40 percent under those charged by the big carriers , or in some cases , up to 60 percent . those however who put value on having the newest , sleekest phone on the market in their purse or pocket and want to play games , get news , or download music and videos will be disappointed .
the low-cost players , according to friedrich , dispense with anything that involves higher operating expenses or development costs . danish success several danish low-cost firms , telmore and cbb mobil , have managed to give big carriers a few sleepless nights with their success .
the two have acquired 43.7 percent of all new mobile customers from 2000 to 2003 .
today , more than 20 percent of mobile customers are using a discount mobile service provider . the developments in denmark have led the mobile phone providers across europe , even in countries without low-cost players , to consider what their future strategies should be .
some are considering offering their own inexpensive plans or creating subsidiaries to try to beat the arrival of the low-cost competition - an event that the big firms say is a given . " after telmore several companies , such as tele.ring in austria and sunrise in switzerland as good candidates for restructuring into low-cost carriers , " said friedrich .
" in sweden and the netherlands there are several companies currently in the starting blocks . " in germany , new providers are sure to mix up the mobile telephony landscape .
the current market structure , two large and two small providers , is considered by the sector to be unstable and nearly predestined for the entry of one or more low-cost carriers .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .
-lrb- march 25 , 2004 -rrb- " rosewood " spy files open for researchers journalists and historians may now access the so-called rosewood files , documents about west german spies who worked for the east german secret police , the stasi .
-lrb- march 19 , 2003 -rrb- turkish " fly catchers " in the stasi 's service the agency administering the files of the former east german secret police has uncovered a little-known chapter in the history of germany 's immigrant guest workers : some served as spies for the stasi .

the damage done by this behavior is enormous , the paper wrote .
the scandal for the rest of the world confirms that the united states has taken on more than it can handle in iraq .
the paper said george w. bush will have to make a sacrifice in washington and the most prominent victim could be the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld . italy ’ s corriere della sera agreed , but added that there is more than rumsfeld ’ s scalp at stake .
the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .
but , the paper points out , he only earns one or two cents a liter .

it was n't that the fans were surprised that their team made it to the finals .
the eisbären had been riding high all season thanks to a line-up of experienced foreign players and young german talent .
but national success is still relatively new for the former east german team .
today , it 's one of the few sports teams from the old gdr that 's risen to the top of the league in reunified germany .
in recent years , the eisbären have even outplayed the west berlin team , the berlin capitals . " it ’ s really something that the eisbären are doing so well now , " local sports journalist klaus weiser told dw-world .
" they ’ re a bit of a cult team , with a long tradition , they ’ ve always been really popular in east berlin .
they were the east german champions 15 times , and after reunification when they played nationally with western teams , they were among the worst , always at the bottom .
but the stadium was always full , and the fans have always been behind them . ” champions of world 's smallest league it ’ s true that the eisbären were at the top of their league in east germany .
but that ’ s not too difficult when the league only has two teams .
the lack of funds for hockey in the gdr meant the eisbären , then known as dynamo berlin , faced off over and over against the only other team in the country , dynamo whitewater .
the players knew each other ’ s style inside out , down to the way they laced up their skates . in 1990 , following german reunification , the eisbären placed a dismal 11th in the national league .
five years later , they were in 17th place .
then , in 1996 , salvation came in the bosman ruling , a court decision which allowed the unlimited employment of foreign players .
the eisbären were one of the first hockey teams to take advantage of the ruling , swapping almost their entire team for talented imports from eastern europe , scandinavia , and north america .
that season , they placed fourth . billionaire investor , foreign players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eisbärens ' logo another stroke of luck came in 1999 , when billionaire american businessman philip anschutz bought the team .
a short while later , he hired the team ’ s current coach , canadian pierre pagé , formerly the coach of such national hockey league -lrb- nhl -rrb- teams as the calgary flames and the anaheim mighty ducks . " it starts with a vision , " pagé said .
" when anschutz came here , he first put some order in the financial books , and then started building a foundation for the team .
people said it could n't be done here , because of all the problems in the past .
but they were wrong .
we respect tradition and history .
we wouldn ’ t be here if it wasn ’ t for the berlin dynamo , they started the whole thing in 1954 . " pagé says his team has the best , most loyal fans in the german hockey league .
and , in turn , the fans are grateful to him and the eisbären 's contingent of foreign players for giving them back a team they can be proud of .
" the foreign players are the very heart of the team right now , " said oliver , a german hockey enthusiast .
" in particular , the players from canada and the u.s. - those with nhl experience - have brought over a lot of know-how , they ’ ve lifted the quality of the game , and that ’ s reflected in the growing level of public interest in the sport . " the eisbären are attracting more fans now that they ’ re winning games .
but their fan base will always be rooted in east berlin , with the people who understand what the team has been through . while the eisbären have learned how to succeed in the new germany , many of their east berlin fans are still struggling .
" a lot of the fans here are unemployed , " said one devoted follower .

they were the east german champions 15 times , and after reunification when they played nationally with western teams , they were among the worst , always at the bottom .
but the stadium was always full , and the fans have always been behind them . ” champions of world 's smallest league it ’ s true that the eisbären were at the top of their league in east germany .
but that ’ s not too difficult when the league only has two teams .
the lack of funds for hockey in the gdr meant the eisbären , then known as dynamo berlin , faced off over and over against the only other team in the country , dynamo whitewater .
the players knew each other ’ s style inside out , down to the way they laced up their skates . in 1990 , following german reunification , the eisbären placed a dismal 11th in the national league .
five years later , they were in 17th place .
then , in 1996 , salvation came in the bosman ruling , a court decision which allowed the unlimited employment of foreign players .
the eisbären were one of the first hockey teams to take advantage of the ruling , swapping almost their entire team for talented imports from eastern europe , scandinavia , and north america .
that season , they placed fourth . billionaire investor , foreign players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eisbärens ' logo another stroke of luck came in 1999 , when billionaire american businessman philip anschutz bought the team .
a short while later , he hired the team ’ s current coach , canadian pierre pagé , formerly the coach of such national hockey league -lrb- nhl -rrb- teams as the calgary flames and the anaheim mighty ducks . " it starts with a vision , " pagé said .
" when anschutz came here , he first put some order in the financial books , and then started building a foundation for the team .
people said it could n't be done here , because of all the problems in the past .
but they were wrong .
we respect tradition and history .
we wouldn ’ t be here if it wasn ’ t for the berlin dynamo , they started the whole thing in 1954 . " pagé says his team has the best , most loyal fans in the german hockey league .
and , in turn , the fans are grateful to him and the eisbären 's contingent of foreign players for giving them back a team they can be proud of .
" the foreign players are the very heart of the team right now , " said oliver , a german hockey enthusiast .
" in particular , the players from canada and the u.s. - those with nhl experience - have brought over a lot of know-how , they ’ ve lifted the quality of the game , and that ’ s reflected in the growing level of public interest in the sport . " the eisbären are attracting more fans now that they ’ re winning games .
but their fan base will always be rooted in east berlin , with the people who understand what the team has been through . while the eisbären have learned how to succeed in the new germany , many of their east berlin fans are still struggling .
" a lot of the fans here are unemployed , " said one devoted follower .
" going to a game offers them an escape from everyday life .
you can just forget about your problems for a while .
it 's a different world inside the arena .

german politicians say berlin missed a great chance at publicity after the parliament refused to allow hollywood star tom cruise to shoot " mission impossible 3 " in berlin 's historic reichstag building . a month after tom cruise arrived in berlin to check out possible locations for the third part of his spy thriller " mission impossible " - the hollywood hunk has been given the cold shoulder by the german parliament . cruise was apparently fascinated by the reichstag 's spectacular glass dome and wanted to shoot there .
but the idea of a hollywood crew trampling through the hallowed corridors of the seat of german democracy was , it seems , too much for parliamentary president wolfgang thierse to bear . earlier this week , he shot down cruise 's wish .
" it 's about preserving the dignity of the parliament , " thierse 's spokesman hans hotter said . but the issue continued to simmer on thursday after politicians from the greens and free democrats bemoaned thierse 's decision .
the parliamentarians said germany had missed a chance to raise its international profile .
" it 's great if such films do n't just play against the backdrop of los angeles or new york , but also in berlin or paris , " greens deputy floor leader volker beck said . " if such a blockbuster can make the reichstag building an international star , then the parliament should n't be so parochial , " free democrats chief guido westerwelle said , adding it was a " brilliant chance to spark worldwide interest in berlin and to lure visitors to germany . " president of berlin 's city-state parliament , walter momper insisted that cruise could still film in berlin and offered his own office , the former prussian assembly building , as an alternative location .
" mr cruise should show us the screenplay , and if it fits with the dignity of the building , then he can film here by paying a small fee , " momper told daily berliner kurier . but , as it turns out , the outcry may be hugely overestimating what 's at stake .
a source at the babelsberg film studios near potsdam told news magazine spiegel that all director joe carnahan wanted was to " shoot a really simple dialogue scene in the dome of the reichstag , " not a sophisticated one with special effects and the works . babelsberg spokesman felix neunzerling too added it was n't a big deal .
" naturally you can also simply build a copy of the dome , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details . four days after the green party pulled out of crucial immigration talks with the conservative opposition - prompting talk of a government crisis - germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens have agreed to bury differences and search for common ground on continuing negotiations . following a government summit meeting in chancellor schröder 's office on friday , representatives from the two parties said they had reached a compromise , according to which the chancellor will hold special meetings with the conservative opposition of christian democrats and its sister party , the christian social union , to determine whether there were any chances for a all-party accord on a new immigration law . but , in the end it would be up to a government committee to decide whether immigration negotiations with the conservative opposition should continue .
the new immigration law is in effect designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and facilitate companies to recruit skilled staff from abroad . the government summit meeting on friday agreed on a declaration in which they accused the opposition christian democrats of blocking talks thus far .
the declaration also stressed that to avoid the immigration law from " becoming an instrument in election campaigns , " the decision on further talks would be taken before the european elections on june 13 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader reinhard bütikofer spd chairman franz müntefering said on friday , " a common law is the priority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.05.2004 german politics captivates theater-goers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " democracy " in berlin : east german spy guillaume whispers in chancellor brandt 's ear michael frayn pays tribute to late german chancellor willy brandt in the play " democracy . "
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .

" the israeli government 's position is that it supports the road map .
we support the road map .
everyone supports the road map , " said cowen .
" now could we please have some activation on the road map and implementation and some good will demonstrated and not allow the enemies of peace to dictate the agenda process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom unlike the united states , however , the european union plays a secondary role in middle east peace mediation , something acknowledged by israeli foreign minister silvan shalom -lrb- photo -rrb- .
shalom attacked the eu behind closed doors , saying the bloc often sided with the palestinians . following prime minister ariel sharon 's failed attempt to get his likud party to appove his plan to withdraw from the gaza strip , shalom said the party would alter the plan accordingly . despite the fact that the palestinian chief negotiator refused to meet his israeli counterpart for discussions , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the meeting was a success .
the european union was able to hear both the opinions of both arab states and the israelis on the conflict . partnership a success eu foreign policy chief javier solana praised the partnership between europe and the mediterranean countries , which started in 1995 . " even despite the difficulties that in that region continue to take place … we have been able to continue working together and doing things which are very beneficial for the countries of this region , " solana said . slow progress was being made to support economic and political reforms , and that the long-term aim remained establishing a free trade zone around the mediterranean in 2010 , eu diplomats said .
the eu already has such an agreement with algeria , morocco , tunisia and jordan .
altogether , the european union and the european investment bank provide € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- for cultural work , educational exchanges and training and reform programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " it 's not a question of whether enough comes back .
instead it 's an investment in stability , " said fischer .
" the central question for european security in the 21st century is whether the mediterranean will become a sea of cooperation or confrontation .
that is not only for the mediterranean states of the eu , but for all of us , of paramount importance . " not too busy for the south eu foreign policy commissioner chris patten countered accusations that the eu was too occupied with its own expansion from 10 to 25 states to look southward . he said the eu-med program " enables us to focus more on ways in which people help those countries which wish … to share much more fully in our market and in the way we do things in the union .
it 's a direct rebuttal of the proposition that enlargement of the european union would lead to a ' fortress europe ' . " besides libya , all north african states are part of the eu-mediterranean program .
but since libyan leader muammar gadhafi 's visit to brussels in late april , the chances have improved for the country , which had observer status at the dublin talks , to be integrated into the eu 's program . " we aim to become a full member , but that will still take come time and agreement in our own bodies , " libyan foreign minister mohammed abdul rahman shalgan said . however , since a libyan court sentenced bulgarian doctors to death this week for allegedly infecting children with the hiv virus , relations have been put on ice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.05.2004 fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 7.3 million foreigners have already made germany their home .
the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details . four days after the green party pulled out of crucial immigration talks with the conservative opposition - prompting talk of a government crisis - germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens have agreed to bury differences and search for common ground on continuing negotiations . following a government summit meeting in chancellor schröder 's office on friday , representatives from the two parties said they had reached a compromise , according to which the chancellor will hold special meetings with the conservative opposition of christian democrats and its sister party , the christian social union , to determine whether there were any chances for a all-party accord on a new immigration law . but , in the end it would be up to a government committee to decide whether immigration negotiations with the conservative opposition should continue .
the new immigration law is in effect designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and facilitate companies to recruit skilled staff from abroad . the government summit meeting on friday agreed on a declaration in which they accused the opposition christian democrats of blocking talks thus far .
the declaration also stressed that to avoid the immigration law from " becoming an instrument in election campaigns , " the decision on further talks would be taken before the european elections on june 13 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader reinhard bütikofer spd chairman franz müntefering said on friday , " a common law is the priority . " green party chief reinhard bütikofer -lrb- photo -rrb- emphasized that it was important that further negotiations with the opposition were marked by a " clear timetable " and a " clear alternative . " conservatives make security issue a priority the latest crisis in the immigration debate came after the greens abandoned talks on monday , saying the conservative opposition was hell-bent on including anti-terrorism measures in the immigration package - a move the greens believe has nothing to do with immigration directly and was blocking all other issues . " we do n't believe that we can come to a responsible solution with the christian democrats , " bütikofer told daily tagesspiegel on thursday . the christian democrats insist - in light of the recent terrorist attacks in madrid - that an accord on the immigration law hinges on reaching agreement on important internal security issues .
the conservatives want a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and participate in violent demonstrations as well as the expulsion of persons who preach hate and violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , they want to deport foreigners sentenced to more than a year in prison , set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . government might go it alone schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . but in light of pressure from business and industry keen to hire skilled personnel from abroad and germany 's rapidly ageing population that needs young workers to keep the social services from collapsing , the government has indicated that it might go it alone with the immigration law if the conservatives do n't fall in line . it would thus seek parliamentary approval for clauses in the immigration law that do n't need the support of the opposition-dominated upper house , which represents germany 's federal states . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens abandon german immigration talks germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .

" the political damage for the usa is so immense , " writes munich 's süddeutsche zeitung , " that even the resignation of donald rumsfeld wo n't even things out . "
but a political victim would send a particularly believable sign that the american government takes seriously its own moral assertions and values that it tries to hold up in iraq .
the paper suggests donald rumsfeld 's resignation would be a sign of humility that has been sorely lacking in him for too long .
for the lübecker nachrichten there 's much to suggest that the pentagon chief donald rumsfeld will be the first to fall over this scandal .

german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .
skilled employees and tomorrow 's experts " do n't just fall from heaven , " said germany 's social democratic education minister edelgard bulmahn -lrb- right -rrb- before friday 's debate and vote in the bundestag . " they must be trained , " she said . the vote passed 300-284 in parliament and does not need approval of the opposition-controlled upper house . the government has been critical of companies that are able of offering traineeships , but do not .
last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines . " we are locked into fragile economic times and issuing threats is n't going to improve the climate for hiring , " martin wansleben , managing director of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told reporters .
" this law is disastrous . " opposition politicians were no more supportive .
guido westerwelle of the business-friendly free democrats said instead of the law creating new traineeships , it would more likely drive more small and medium-size companies into the ground . hartmut schauerte of the conservative christian democrats called the law a " catastrophic miscalculation . " " this is not a good day for vocational training in germany , " he told the ddp news agency . business or young people first ? but green party parliamentarian grietje bettin criticized opposition politicians for only looking out for the interests of the business community and ignoring the needs of young people in need of training . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she said the fine should not be seen as a penalty , but rather as a fair and socially just method to create a balance between companies that do train and those that do not . nicolette kressl of the spd responded to opposition criticism by saying politicians from those parties had not suggested any alternative measures to increase the overall number of traineeships on offer . the move to pass some kind of legislation gained momentum last year , when 35,000 people who sought traineeships failed to find one .
there were 182,000 apprenticeships in total last month , about 27,000 lower than the year before , according to germany 's federal labor agency . in a survey carried out by the university of dortmund , 42 percent of german parents asked said they worried that their child would not find " an appropriate traineeship " after leaving school , up from 32 percent a decade ago .
in the eastern part of germany , 24 percent were against the imposition of fines on companies which did not sufficiently train .
in western germany , only 19 percent were against such a system . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder gets tough on traineeship deficit german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo .

the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details . four days after the green party pulled out of crucial immigration talks with the conservative opposition - prompting talk of a government crisis - germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens have agreed to bury differences and search for common ground on continuing negotiations . following a government summit meeting in chancellor schröder 's office on friday , representatives from the two parties said they had reached a compromise , according to which the chancellor will hold special meetings with the conservative opposition of christian democrats and its sister party , the christian social union , to determine whether there were any chances for a all-party accord on a new immigration law . but , in the end it would be up to a government committee to decide whether immigration negotiations with the conservative opposition should continue .
the new immigration law is in effect designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and facilitate companies to recruit skilled staff from abroad . the government summit meeting on friday agreed on a declaration in which they accused the opposition christian democrats of blocking talks thus far .
the declaration also stressed that to avoid the immigration law from " becoming an instrument in election campaigns , " the decision on further talks would be taken before the european elections on june 13 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader reinhard bütikofer spd chairman franz müntefering said on friday , " a common law is the priority . " green party chief reinhard bütikofer -lrb- photo -rrb- emphasized that it was important that further negotiations with the opposition were marked by a " clear timetable " and a " clear alternative . " conservatives make security issue a priority the latest crisis in the immigration debate came after the greens abandoned talks on monday , saying the conservative opposition was hell-bent on including anti-terrorism measures in the immigration package - a move the greens believe has nothing to do with immigration directly and was blocking all other issues . " we do n't believe that we can come to a responsible solution with the christian democrats , " bütikofer told daily tagesspiegel on thursday . the christian democrats insist - in light of the recent terrorist attacks in madrid - that an accord on the immigration law hinges on reaching agreement on important internal security issues .
the conservatives want a speedy deportation of foreigners who belong to extremist outfits and participate in violent demonstrations as well as the expulsion of persons who preach hate and violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , they want to deport foreigners sentenced to more than a year in prison , set up a central database for storing details of germans who invite foreigners requiring a visa and tighten rules on accepting asylum-seekers . government might go it alone schröder 's government has already been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation of 2002 under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . but in light of pressure from business and industry keen to hire skilled personnel from abroad and germany 's rapidly ageing population that needs young workers to keep the social services from collapsing , the government has indicated that it might go it alone with the immigration law if the conservatives do n't fall in line . it would thus seek parliamentary approval for clauses in the immigration law that do n't need the support of the opposition-dominated upper house , which represents germany 's federal states . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens abandon german immigration talks germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .

deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .
but will the news revive germany 's flagging shareholder culture ? stock market enthusiasts have reason to hope again .
the head of postbank , wulf von schimmelmann , and the executive chairman of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , have big things planned . on june 21 , postbank goes public .
with its clear position as a private bank and a low-risk business model , the credit institute is " fit for the stock market , " said zumwinkel . postbank plans to list up to 50 percent of its equity capital minus one share on the german stock exchange - meaning that deutsche post will remain the majority shareholder .
a price range for the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
experts are already speculating on a price of € 30 per share .
proceeds of about € 3 billion should flow into deutsche post 's coffers as a result of the listing .
the company said it plans to use the money on a stratetgic expansion - among the countries mentioned were austria and denmark .
prognosis positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is the largest private bank in germany .
at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .
and with good reason .
postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .
" the savings deposits alone have climbed by € 1.6 billion , " he said , adding that , last year , the bank managed to triple its net profits in comparison with the previous year .
all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .
shortly before the postbank ipo was announced , the financial times deutschland reported that deutsche bank was aiming for a complete takeover of postbank , and that there 'd already been discussions to that effect with the government .
zumwinkel denies the rumours , though , saying deutsche post intends to be the majority shareholder for the long run . arend wulff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post looks abroad driven by aggressive international expansion , deutsche post reported a profit in 2003 .

german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .
proponents say it will ensure future employment .
critics counter it will not create any new traineeships . the law , which has been hotly debated for months , will go into affect this fall if german companies overall do n't provide 15 percent more traineeships than the number of applicants .
if that is the case , companies not meeting hiring targets will be forced to pay into a fund , which will then be redistributed to firms which take on the required number of trainees . to avoid the fine , companies with over 10 employees must prove that at least seven percent of their employees are apprentices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn speaking before the german parliament .

last year , fewer than one-fourth of the 2.1 million german companies entitled to offer traineeships did so .
the number of companies and young people entering into traineeship contracts last year fell to its lowest level since 1990 , according to the federal institute of vocational education -lrb- bibb -rrb- . industry displeasure business groups , however , slammed the vote , saying it was counterproductive in that it would not create more trainee positions and that it was yet another bureaucratic hurdle an already burdened german business community would have to jump over . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said some 300 personnel will be needed to process any possible fines .

" the israeli government 's position is that it supports the road map .
we support the road map .
everyone supports the road map , " said cowen .
" now could we please have some activation on the road map and implementation and some good will demonstrated and not allow the enemies of peace to dictate the agenda process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom unlike the united states , however , the european union plays a secondary role in middle east peace mediation , something acknowledged by israeli foreign minister silvan shalom -lrb- photo -rrb- .
shalom attacked the eu behind closed doors , saying the bloc often sided with the palestinians . following prime minister ariel sharon 's failed attempt to get his likud party to appove his plan to withdraw from the gaza strip , shalom said the party would alter the plan accordingly . despite the fact that the palestinian chief negotiator refused to meet his israeli counterpart for discussions , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the meeting was a success .
the european union was able to hear both the opinions of both arab states and the israelis on the conflict . partnership a success eu foreign policy chief javier solana praised the partnership between europe and the mediterranean countries , which started in 1995 . " even despite the difficulties that in that region continue to take place … we have been able to continue working together and doing things which are very beneficial for the countries of this region , " solana said . slow progress was being made to support economic and political reforms , and that the long-term aim remained establishing a free trade zone around the mediterranean in 2010 , eu diplomats said .
the eu already has such an agreement with algeria , morocco , tunisia and jordan .
altogether , the european union and the european investment bank provide € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- for cultural work , educational exchanges and training and reform programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " it 's not a question of whether enough comes back .
instead it 's an investment in stability , " said fischer .
" the central question for european security in the 21st century is whether the mediterranean will become a sea of cooperation or confrontation .
that is not only for the mediterranean states of the eu , but for all of us , of paramount importance . " not too busy for the south eu foreign policy commissioner chris patten countered accusations that the eu was too occupied with its own expansion from 10 to 25 states to look southward . he said the eu-med program " enables us to focus more on ways in which people help those countries which wish … to share much more fully in our market and in the way we do things in the union .
it 's a direct rebuttal of the proposition that enlargement of the european union would lead to a ' fortress europe ' . " besides libya , all north african states are part of the eu-mediterranean program .
but since libyan leader muammar gadhafi 's visit to brussels in late april , the chances have improved for the country , which had observer status at the dublin talks , to be integrated into the eu 's program . " we aim to become a full member , but that will still take come time and agreement in our own bodies , " libyan foreign minister mohammed abdul rahman shalgan said . however , since a libyan court sentenced bulgarian doctors to death this week for allegedly infecting children with the hiv virus , relations have been put on ice .
but cowen made clear that change will only come if the sentence is rescinded and a solution is found . berndt riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe-med forum to push for middle east ceasefire stability in the middle east and the fight against terrorism top the agenda at a meeting between eu foreign ministers and representatives from southern mediterranean states in dublin on thursday .

deutsche postbank , a unit of deutsche post worldnet ag , has announced plans to sell shares in almost 50 percent of its equity capital on the stock market .
but will the news revive germany 's flagging shareholder culture ? stock market enthusiasts have reason to hope again .
the head of postbank , wulf von schimmelmann , and the executive chairman of deutsche post , klaus zumwinkel , have big things planned . on june 21 , postbank goes public .
with its clear position as a private bank and a low-risk business model , the credit institute is " fit for the stock market , " said zumwinkel . postbank plans to list up to 50 percent of its equity capital minus one share on the german stock exchange - meaning that deutsche post will remain the majority shareholder .
a price range for the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- is expected to be set june 5 or 6 , with the final price to be set june 19 .
the application for shares begins on june 7 .
experts are already speculating on a price of € 30 per share .
proceeds of about € 3 billion should flow into deutsche post 's coffers as a result of the listing .
the company said it plans to use the money on a stratetgic expansion - among the countries mentioned were austria and denmark .
prognosis positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is the largest private bank in germany .
at postbank and deutsche post , it 's optimism all the way .
and with good reason .
postbank is germany 's largest private bank , with some 11.5 million customers .
according to schimmelman , postbank 's first quarter results have been company record-breakers .
" the savings deposits alone have climbed by € 1.6 billion , " he said , adding that , last year , the bank managed to triple its net profits in comparison with the previous year .
all in all , the prognosis for postbank 's ipo looks good .
and potential shareholders are already hoping that the listing will provide the impetus to bring germany 's flagging capital market back to life .
the postbank ipo is the biggest stock market debut europe has seen in more than three years , according to markus straub of the german shareholders association .
in germany , it 's the first stock market entry in 2 1/2 years , following the failed attempts of semi-conductor companies silitronic and x-fab to go public in march .
anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .
shortly before the postbank ipo was announced , the financial times deutschland reported that deutsche bank was aiming for a complete takeover of postbank , and that there 'd already been discussions to that effect with the government .

anticipation is building about how postbank stock will perform on the german stock market index , the dax .
but straub has retained a healthy skepticism .
it 's still too early to comment on the numbers being floated , he said , adding that it 's best to wait until the final share price has been announced .
past experience with the ipo 's of both deutsche post and deutsche telekom have shown it 's better to err on the side of caution .
" as an investor , i know that state companies and their subsidiaries have n't lived up to all the hype , " straub said .
the next telekom ?
so will postbank be the new darling of german shareholders ?
even postbank employees have no illusions there .
while they expect that with the ipo , the company will become more popular with private investors , they say postbank is more interested in attracting large corporate investors .
that would certainly save straub and others at the german shareholders association some headaches .
" we hope that there wo n't be a big marketing campaign like there was with the telekom shares , where you have celebrities trying to convince ordinary people to buy overpriced shares , " said straub , referring to telekom 's infamous bid to get ordinary germans to buy their stocks in the late 1990s .
shortly before the postbank ipo was announced , the financial times deutschland reported that deutsche bank was aiming for a complete takeover of postbank , and that there 'd already been discussions to that effect with the government .
zumwinkel denies the rumours , though , saying deutsche post intends to be the majority shareholder for the long run . arend wulff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche post looks abroad driven by aggressive international expansion , deutsche post reported a profit in 2003 .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.05.2004 german press review : bush and rumsfeld in the media dock german papers on friday continue to comment on the iraq torture scandal and the consequences it could have for the bush administration as increasing gas prices that are plaguing europe . " the political damage for the usa is so immense , " writes munich 's süddeutsche zeitung , " that even the resignation of donald rumsfeld wo n't even things out . "
but a political victim would send a particularly believable sign that the american government takes seriously its own moral assertions and values that it tries to hold up in iraq .
the paper suggests donald rumsfeld 's resignation would be a sign of humility that has been sorely lacking in him for too long .
for the lübecker nachrichten there 's much to suggest that the pentagon chief donald rumsfeld will be the first to fall over this scandal .
but , adds the paper , even president bush ca n't slip away from personal responsibility .
" that the president in front of arabic television could not even bring himself to say sorry is disgraceful . "
" this gesture was the absolute minimum requirement , " writes the daily , " because now the us which was supposed to stand for freedom and democracy , symbolizes the worst things humans are capable of , brutality , humiliation and inhumanity . "
" this has n't just happened out of the blue , " writes the aachener nachrichten .
" why , then , has the bush administration been so willing to hand over al qaeda suspects captured in afghanistan to other countries ?
the answer is quite simply because their more vigorous interrogation methods will see results .
or if we put it another way , " writes the daily , " because they engage in torture . "
u.s. president george w bush has reacted with shock at the images of torture in iraqi prisons by american soldiers .
but adds the paper , " the question remains whether it 's the torture itself that disturbs the president or the images of the torture ? "
the financial times deutschland writes that the accusations of torture against u.s. soldiers has grown to a barely containable foreign policy issue for the white house and notes that half a year before the presidential elections the topic of iraq is again the central issue .
but the paper doubts that the presidential candidate john kerry will be able to utilize this scandal to his advantage .
the paper believes president bush 's interview on arabic television was designed for an american audience to show he was taking responsibility .
and according to this daily there 's no sign yet that bush will lose the election on the issue of iraq .
the rise in crude oil prices pushing petrol in germany to € 1.20 per liter leaves many papers grumbling .
the mass-circulation bild zeitung writes that at the petrol stations three drivers did n't bother to fill their tanks .
" everyone 's scrimping and saving , " writes the paper .
" but the politicians that are chauffeured around for free should realize that germany needs to remain mobile , to transport the millions of commuters and the goods they produce - otherwise the country will be threatened by stoppages and everyone will be poorer , " the paper argues .
the mittelbayerisch zeitung from regensburg disagrees - while the german auto club adac the opposition conservatives and others call for the eco-tax to be dropped – the southern german paper argues that this environmental levy has sensible and long-term goals .
world oil prices will fall again , points out the daily , and dropping the eco levy for two weeks to alleviate higher petrol prices is a short-term solution that will have no impact .

i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .
-lrb- march 25 , 2004 -rrb- " rosewood " spy files open for researchers journalists and historians may now access the so-called rosewood files , documents about west german spies who worked for the east german secret police , the stasi .

the damage done by this behavior is enormous , the paper wrote .
the scandal for the rest of the world confirms that the united states has taken on more than it can handle in iraq .
the paper said george w. bush will have to make a sacrifice in washington and the most prominent victim could be the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld . italy ’ s corriere della sera agreed , but added that there is more than rumsfeld ’ s scalp at stake .
the whole u.s. strategy in iraq is now questionable , the paper said , and we are now seeing the first signs of disagreement within the government in washington . austria ’ s der standard noted that the psychological torture committed in the baghdad prison , although terrible , can not be compared to the atrocities committed in the same building under saddam hussein .
but , the paper emphasized , this does not change the fact that the image of america as a benevolent and positive force has been largely obliterated . germany ’ s frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented that one can only imagine how many major planning mistakes have been caused by the quibbling over how to run the war and establish the peace in iraq .
with all the mistakes together – and they are all mistakes by the pentagon , the paper said – it is a miracle that most parts of iraq are relatively peaceful .
but , the paper warned , the mistakes are taking their toll and this war is far from over . britain ’ s independent said the pictures bring to mind the worst images of the vietnam war , and this is part of a culture and a long tradition that stretches back to the crusades : that moslems are unclean , depraved unbelievers , unfit to be treated as humans .
this , the paper added , is pretty much what osama bin laden says about the west . the french daily , liberation , turned its attention to the skyrocketing fuel prices in europe .
the paper blamed george w. bush .
he has turned the entire middle east into a war zone , the paper said , adding that the price of oil is a good barometer for the state of the world . in germany , for example , a liter of gas now costs about € 1.20 .
germany ’ s mass-circulation bild noted that germans are crimping to save and stretch their budgets .
instead of filling up , they are spending € 10 or € 20 and complaining to the gas station attendant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.05.2004 eu wants " some good will " in mideast peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish foreign minister cowen : please activate the middle east " road map " the eu called on the israelis and the palestinians to finally activate the " road map " meant to resolve their conflict after talks between the bloc , nine southern neighbors and the palestinian authority on thursday . irish foreign minister brian cowen said he saw chances for a ceasefire between the israelis and palestinians at the european union-mediterranean talks in the irish capital . cowen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called on both sides to finally enact the peace plan brokered by the so-called middle east quartet made up of the eu , russia , the united states and the united nations . " the israeli government 's position is that it supports the road map .
we support the road map .
everyone supports the road map , " said cowen .
" now could we please have some activation on the road map and implementation and some good will demonstrated and not allow the enemies of peace to dictate the agenda process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom unlike the united states , however , the european union plays a secondary role in middle east peace mediation , something acknowledged by israeli foreign minister silvan shalom -lrb- photo -rrb- .
shalom attacked the eu behind closed doors , saying the bloc often sided with the palestinians . following prime minister ariel sharon 's failed attempt to get his likud party to appove his plan to withdraw from the gaza strip , shalom said the party would alter the plan accordingly . despite the fact that the palestinian chief negotiator refused to meet his israeli counterpart for discussions , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the meeting was a success .
the european union was able to hear both the opinions of both arab states and the israelis on the conflict . partnership a success eu foreign policy chief javier solana praised the partnership between europe and the mediterranean countries , which started in 1995 . " even despite the difficulties that in that region continue to take place … we have been able to continue working together and doing things which are very beneficial for the countries of this region , " solana said . slow progress was being made to support economic and political reforms , and that the long-term aim remained establishing a free trade zone around the mediterranean in 2010 , eu diplomats said .
the eu already has such an agreement with algeria , morocco , tunisia and jordan .
altogether , the european union and the european investment bank provide € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- for cultural work , educational exchanges and training and reform programs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer " it 's not a question of whether enough comes back .
instead it 's an investment in stability , " said fischer .
" the central question for european security in the 21st century is whether the mediterranean will become a sea of cooperation or confrontation .
that is not only for the mediterranean states of the eu , but for all of us , of paramount importance . " not too busy for the south eu foreign policy commissioner chris patten countered accusations that the eu was too occupied with its own expansion from 10 to 25 states to look southward . he said the eu-med program " enables us to focus more on ways in which people help those countries which wish … to share much more fully in our market and in the way we do things in the union .
it 's a direct rebuttal of the proposition that enlargement of the european union would lead to a ' fortress europe ' . " besides libya , all north african states are part of the eu-mediterranean program .

amnesty international released a report this week accusing the international community of encouraging the sex trade in kosovo .
but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

but nato and the un say the report is out of date and unreliable . the human rights organization slammed the united nations and nato for not doing more to punish its people for contributing to what has become a flourishing sex industry in the balkan country . since 1999 , when international peacekeepers entered the country after negotiating an end to the conflict between kosovo and serbia , the number of institutions where women and girls are being exploited has mushroomed from 18 to 200 in 2003 , according to the report .
girls as young as 11 have been lured under false pretenses from places like moldova , the ukraine and bulgaria to work in the sex trade . " we were his property , " one women told amnesty of her treatment in kosovo .
" by buying us , he had the right to beat us , rape us , starve us and force us to have sex with clients . " international workers spend money on sex especially abhorrent , alleges amnesty , is the complacency with which the international community has treated the problem .
most of the women are still being treated as criminals by kosovo authorities , charged as prostitutes or illegal immigrants , according to the report . rather than condemn the abuses , the international community makes up an estimated 20 percent of the clientele that supports the sex industry , amnesty claims . " with clients including international police and troops , the girls and women are often too afraid to escape and the authorities are failing to help them , " according to amnesty . there are an estimated 40,000 soldiers , police officers and international workers in kosovo .

amnesty says more needs to be done , including guaranteeing victims redress and reparation and setting up some sort of witness protection program for the women .

it was n't that the fans were surprised that their team made it to the finals .
the eisbären had been riding high all season thanks to a line-up of experienced foreign players and young german talent .
but national success is still relatively new for the former east german team .
today , it 's one of the few sports teams from the old gdr that 's risen to the top of the league in reunified germany .
in recent years , the eisbären have even outplayed the west berlin team , the berlin capitals . " it ’ s really something that the eisbären are doing so well now , " local sports journalist klaus weiser told dw-world .
" they ’ re a bit of a cult team , with a long tradition , they ’ ve always been really popular in east berlin .
they were the east german champions 15 times , and after reunification when they played nationally with western teams , they were among the worst , always at the bottom .
but the stadium was always full , and the fans have always been behind them . ” champions of world 's smallest league it ’ s true that the eisbären were at the top of their league in east germany .
but that ’ s not too difficult when the league only has two teams .
the lack of funds for hockey in the gdr meant the eisbären , then known as dynamo berlin , faced off over and over against the only other team in the country , dynamo whitewater .
the players knew each other ’ s style inside out , down to the way they laced up their skates . in 1990 , following german reunification , the eisbären placed a dismal 11th in the national league .
five years later , they were in 17th place .
then , in 1996 , salvation came in the bosman ruling , a court decision which allowed the unlimited employment of foreign players .
the eisbären were one of the first hockey teams to take advantage of the ruling , swapping almost their entire team for talented imports from eastern europe , scandinavia , and north america .
that season , they placed fourth . billionaire investor , foreign players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eisbärens ' logo another stroke of luck came in 1999 , when billionaire american businessman philip anschutz bought the team .
a short while later , he hired the team ’ s current coach , canadian pierre pagé , formerly the coach of such national hockey league -lrb- nhl -rrb- teams as the calgary flames and the anaheim mighty ducks . " it starts with a vision , " pagé said .
" when anschutz came here , he first put some order in the financial books , and then started building a foundation for the team .
people said it could n't be done here , because of all the problems in the past .
but they were wrong .
we respect tradition and history .
we wouldn ’ t be here if it wasn ’ t for the berlin dynamo , they started the whole thing in 1954 . " pagé says his team has the best , most loyal fans in the german hockey league .
and , in turn , the fans are grateful to him and the eisbären 's contingent of foreign players for giving them back a team they can be proud of .
" the foreign players are the very heart of the team right now , " said oliver , a german hockey enthusiast .
" in particular , the players from canada and the u.s. - those with nhl experience - have brought over a lot of know-how , they ’ ve lifted the quality of the game , and that ’ s reflected in the growing level of public interest in the sport . " the eisbären are attracting more fans now that they ’ re winning games .
but their fan base will always be rooted in east berlin , with the people who understand what the team has been through . while the eisbären have learned how to succeed in the new germany , many of their east berlin fans are still struggling .
" a lot of the fans here are unemployed , " said one devoted follower .
" going to a game offers them an escape from everyday life .
you can just forget about your problems for a while .
it 's a different world inside the arena .

"
the award-winning drama premiered in london last year and opened thursday in berlin .
dw-world spoke with the british playwright . berlin was the spy 's playground during the cold war , and it 's a fitting place to meet 70-year-old michael fray , the british playwright , novelist and translator , who penned " democracy . "
the play focuses on west germany 's biggest counterintelligence scandal , when in 1974 chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistant günter guillaume was exposed as an east german spy .
exactly 30 years ago , on may 7 , brandt , the first social democratic chancellor of the postwar era , resigned .
what remained of his four and a half year tenure were the treaties he had brokered to normalize relations with poland and mutually renouncing violence with the soviet union .
brandt was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1971 for his contribution to european reconciliation . " democracy " has been a huge success in london and continues to play to packed houses there .
the drama had its german premier in a berlin theater thursday and is set to open on broadway in october . dw-world : the germans must be thankful to you for writing the play democracy . "
you cast willy brandt , a key figure of german history , in a very positive light , portraying him as a wise , humane and profound man .
did you intend to give the germans a hero ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael frayn michael frayn : willy brandt was a hero long before i arrived on the scene .
he was great man .
and he had a great achievement : he began the reconciliation with the east .
even if he had n't managed to get the eastern treaties through he would still would have been a great man .
there was something about him which held everyone 's attention .
many people hated him , but he also inspired love in many people , here in germany and abroad . why write a play about brandt and german politics ? i wanted to write a play about the complexity of politics .
and german politics is a particularly good example , because it is so complex , because of the federal system .
and also because every german government since the second world war has been a coalition .
and almost nobody else can make a coalition work .
-lsb- they 're -rsb- terrified that things will be unstable .
and the other great complexity of german politics was of course the fact that germany was divided into two countries for so many years .
but i wanted to write about brandt and guillaume in particular , because i also wanted the play to be not only about the complexity of politics but the complexity of individual human beings . it 's quite unusual for a british playwright to deal with german politics . but german politics is particular interesting , because it is so complicated .
it 's a much more complicated version of democratic politics than we have in britain .
there are lots of british plays about the nazi period .
but no one has yet started to write about what is much more interesting to me : the amazing recovery after the second world war , which maybe astonishes me more as an outsider than it does germans , because germans take it for granted . is brandt something like an anti-hitler ? he was an anti-hitler , absolutely .
he was always an opponent of nazism .
he was in exile throughout the nazi period .
when he became chancellor , he did say on this day , " the war that hitler began against the nations of europe and so many people in our own nation is finally lost . " your previous play , " copenhagen , " in which the german physicist werner heisenberg meets his mentor , niels bohr , in 1941 , deals with the conflict between good and evil . " copenhagen " is about how difficult it is to know why people do what they do .
until you know that , you ca n't make any judgement about whether what they do is good or bad .
you have to know what there intentions are . why does someone like the spy günter guillaume , who describes himself as a " nobody " in " democracy , " do what he does ? i think guillaume was probably a loyal citizen of the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- .
he thought he could serve them by working for the stasi -lrb- the east german secret police -rrb- .
they sent him to the west , and , purely by chance , he got into the federal chancellor 's office .
i suppose then he thought he could continue honourably , loyally serving the gdr , the stasi , although at the same time , of course , he came to admire brandt very much . is he a symbol for the average german ? i would n't think the average german works for two different governments at the same time .
but everyone has different possibilities inside himself , has to find some way of resolving these possibilities .
so guillaume is just a particularly extreme example of that . the only member of the gdr leadership who plays a role in " democracy " - although he never appears - is former stasi chief mischa wolf .
was he the real focus of fascination ? mischa wolf is a very intriguing character .
he was perhaps the most successful spymaster in the world .
but i think , by far , the most interesting character in that period is brandt himself , because he was a very complex man .
he had many dark places inside himself , in spite of his obvious success .
he suffered a great deal from depression , and he had many serious weaknesses , not just superficial ones like drinking too much and being too interested in women .
he was konfliktscheu -lrb- wary of confrontation -rrb- and he found it very difficult to come to decisions . what remains from the period besides a stirring story ? what remains from that time is brandt 's achievement , the ostpolitik -lrb- eastern policy -rrb- .
that changed everything in europe .
it began to make it possible to end the cold war .
it was only the first step , but perhaps without that first step , there would still be a gdr , there would still be a soviet union , there would still be a nuclear stalemate .
it was the first step , and that changed the world . klemens vogel interviewed michael frayn -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german spy christel guillaume dies christel guillaume , wife of the east german spy who brought down a west german chancellor , died in berlin of heart failure on saturday , according to her son .

big european mobile phone carriers are now facing a headache big airlines have already confronted : low-cost competition .
the mobile phone equivalents of ryanair and easyjet are promising to shake up the market . it was probably only a question of time until some enterprising businessperson saw the possibilities in emulating the successful model of the low-cost air carriers .
while ryanair , german wings and hapag-lloyd have undercut the giants of the aviation industry and forced them to radically reevaluate how they do business , mobile phone upstarts like denmark 's telmore are doing the same in its own sector . after years of growth , the european mobile phone market is saturated , since already 80 percent of europeans already own mobile phones .
mobile phone service providers can not count on basing future business strategies on winning new customers .
they are n't there to be had . " in the next few years , a segmentation of the market is going to take place , similar to what we 've seen with the airlines , " roman friedrich , telecoms analyst at the consulting firm booz allen hamilton deutschland , told dw-world .
he said according to studies his firm has carried out , the european mobile phone market is standing just before a turning point . " by the end of the year in europe there will several low-cost providers and in two years at the most , in almost every country there will be at least one big low-cost operator , " he said . up to 60 percent cheaper it 's likely that low-cost mobile phone providers will find the same enthusiastic reception as europe 's low-cost air carriers have .
friedrich estimates that up to 20 percent of mobile phone users could switch to low-cost carriers . for those who use their mobile phones for just telephoning and have little interest in high-tech extras or service hotlines , low-cost providers are an attractive alternative .
prices can run from 30 to 40 percent under those charged by the big carriers , or in some cases , up to 60 percent . those however who put value on having the newest , sleekest phone on the market in their purse or pocket and want to play games , get news , or download music and videos will be disappointed .
the low-cost players , according to friedrich , dispense with anything that involves higher operating expenses or development costs . danish success several danish low-cost firms , telmore and cbb mobil , have managed to give big carriers a few sleepless nights with their success .
the two have acquired 43.7 percent of all new mobile customers from 2000 to 2003 .
today , more than 20 percent of mobile customers are using a discount mobile service provider . the developments in denmark have led the mobile phone providers across europe , even in countries without low-cost players , to consider what their future strategies should be .

" after telmore several companies , such as tele.ring in austria and sunrise in switzerland as good candidates for restructuring into low-cost carriers , " said friedrich .
" in sweden and the netherlands there are several companies currently in the starting blocks . " in germany , new providers are sure to mix up the mobile telephony landscape .

friedrich estimates that up to 20 percent of mobile phone users could switch to low-cost carriers . for those who use their mobile phones for just telephoning and have little interest in high-tech extras or service hotlines , low-cost providers are an attractive alternative .
prices can run from 30 to 40 percent under those charged by the big carriers , or in some cases , up to 60 percent . those however who put value on having the newest , sleekest phone on the market in their purse or pocket and want to play games , get news , or download music and videos will be disappointed .
the low-cost players , according to friedrich , dispense with anything that involves higher operating expenses or development costs . danish success several danish low-cost firms , telmore and cbb mobil , have managed to give big carriers a few sleepless nights with their success .
the two have acquired 43.7 percent of all new mobile customers from 2000 to 2003 .
today , more than 20 percent of mobile customers are using a discount mobile service provider . the developments in denmark have led the mobile phone providers across europe , even in countries without low-cost players , to consider what their future strategies should be .
some are considering offering their own inexpensive plans or creating subsidiaries to try to beat the arrival of the low-cost competition - an event that the big firms say is a given . " after telmore several companies , such as tele.ring in austria and sunrise in switzerland as good candidates for restructuring into low-cost carriers , " said friedrich .
" in sweden and the netherlands there are several companies currently in the starting blocks . " in germany , new providers are sure to mix up the mobile telephony landscape .
the current market structure , two large and two small providers , is considered by the sector to be unstable and nearly predestined for the entry of one or more low-cost carriers .

just 56 arrived the next working day is the postal service failing to deliver on its promises ?
after a deluge of e-mails complaining about the post , we devoted much of this morning 's programme to a special investigation of the state of the royal mail .
we heard from the bbc 's reporters and correspondents around the country , who 've been conducting a snapshot test of the royal mail .
between them , they posted 100 first class letters on wednesday afternoon .
only 56 of them had arrived by late yesterday afternoon - well short of the royal mail 's own targets. go to the full results of our post test breakfast 's julia botfield reports on our 100-letter test in a special programme this morning , breakfast asked : is the royal mail failing to deliver ?
we put the results of our spot-check to the chief executive of the royal mail , adam crozier .
crozier : taking personal charge " we recognise that you have highlighted some problem areas , " he told us .
" as group chief executive , i will step in to run the letters business .
" until now , i have not personally run the letters business , but i think it 's important that i do - i think it 's important that everyone takes responsibility for the letters business , from the top to the bottom . "
mr crozier revealed he 'd called a meeting of operations directors in london , to sort out problems with deliveries .
" we are focused on making sure that the quality of service improves and we hope to begin to see improvements within the next two to three months . " watch our interview with adam crozier we talked to billy hayes , leader of the union of communications workers he told us post workers were struggling to cope with an increasing number of addresses - up from 21 million to 27 million - while 10 % of the workforce had been cut. watch our interview with billy hayes and - again - we had hundreds of e-mails read a selection of e-mails on our your comments page for the price of a first class stamp - 28p - the royal mail aims to deliver letters the next working day , wherever they 're posted in the uk .
in reality , just over 92 % of first class letters arrived on time last year .
during last autumn 's wildcat strikes , the figure dropped to about 80 % it 's thought that around 14 million letters go missing each year .
after conducting its own survey , the consumer organisation postwatch reckons that much of the missing mail has been wrongly-delivered , rather than stolen or destroyed .
most of us deliver the letter to the right address - but we might take some time to do it .
but a small minority of us put mis-delivered letters straight into the bin .
we asked bbc correspondents and producers to send 100 first class letters across the country .

but some celebrities believe they no longer have the privacy guarantee that once came with the confines of the country .
the countryside rights of way act allows ramblers the right to roam 18,130 sq km -lrb- 7,000 sq miles -rrb- over mountain , moor , heath and down in england and wales .
in december anyone will be able to get within 100 yards of madonna 's £ 9m , 1,200-acre georgian retreat , ashcombe , in wiltshire .
' eyes and ears ' parliament has given the countryside agency the task of deciding which areas will be open to ramblers and what constitutes public land .
there are easier ways to celebrity spot than standing 200m away ; you would n't see much , i suspect paul bell , ramblers ' association madonna and her film director husband guy ritchie have appealed against the decision to turn 100 acres of their land into open countryside .
the couple believe their human rights would be breached and their privacy infringed by allowing the press and fans so close to their home .
in a five-day public inquiry opened on wednesday to decide the case , their lawyer has argued that the description of the land as open countryside is inappropriate as it is farmland .
but paul bell , from the ramblers ' association , has said he does not understand why the public 's right to roam has been opposed .
" the land is at least 200m away .
there 's a centuries old public footpath that 's closer to the house .
there are easier ways to celebrity spot than standing 200m away , you would n't see much i suspect , " mr bell said .
rather , mr bell believes that walkers would be a help rather than a hindrance : " legitimate ramblers will be a deterrent to people who have a criminal intent .
" when john major was prime minister , cambridgeshire police decided to keep a footpath near his home open because ramblers acted as the eyes and ears to anything peculiar . "
' legal duty ' andy wistow , senior countryside officer with the countryside agency , is giving evidence to the inquiry and says fame is not an issue when designating land as open countryside .
keith richards had opposed plans to build a cycle path near his home " the act has a provision that allows the owner to stop people coming within 20m of their property .

the national archives holds central government and law court records dating back to the 11th century .
family history week , running from 8 may , will offer a comprehensive guide to using the collection and general advice on tracing a family tree .
the national archives ' sam evans said the week 's events are particularly suited to people starting out on their quest , with experts offering a one-to-one " surgery " on the opening day .
the arrival of the internet has prompted a family history boom , miss evans said .
" when people start doing it , it becomes quite addictive .
it 's the thrill of the chase , " she said .
" it is exciting to find skeletons in the cupboard , what grandma has been keeping tight-lipped about .
people uncover quite amazing stories , and even if they do n't this does give them a real sense of identity . "
spanning centuries during the week , there will be talks on using the archives ' records , which include world war i army records , emigration , census , apprenticeship , royal and merchant seaman and railway staff records , and slave registers .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- can airbus conquer the world ?

by tom symonds bbc transport correspondent a truly enormous plane , an even bigger hangar to build it in , talk of a revolution in air travel , extravagant promises of airborne casinos , bars and shops .
we 've been here before .
rising demand for air travel makes larger aircraft viable as the assembly of the airbus a380 super-airliner begins , it is becoming apparent that in many ways its advent is just history repeating itself .
back in the mid 60s , almost the same claims were made for the boeing 747 jumbo jet .
it would carry more passengers , 400 to be precise , and enable airlines to slash costs .
but the a380 has been designed for its time , and that means building- ' em-big .
environmental credentials there has been a huge increase in demand for air travel .
with twin decks running the length of the plane , there will be staircases at the front and rear in pictures : from drawing board to production this allows airlines to use even bigger planes than the 747 , with less fear that they may fly with empty seats .
the size of the a380 means it can take a third more passengers than a jumbo jet , about 555 people , so that fewer flights will be needed to carry the same number of passengers .
slots in and out of major hub airports are at a premium .
and in the uk particularly , there 's pressure to limit airport expansion .
airbus also promotes the a380 's environmental credentials - it does 95 miles to the gallon per passenger .
the a380 thus consumes less fuel per passenger than its competitors .
where the parts come from it is a sales pitch that has attracted orders from 11 international airlines , a total of 129 a380s to date .
airbus is keen to build an upmarket image for the giant aircraft but what sort of business model are they signing up to ?
put simply , a380s will fly to around 60 big airports around the world , the hubs .
after all , it is a big plane and not all airports can handle it .
crucially , passengers wanting to get to smaller cities will have to transfer .
luxury airlines will have to convince passengers they want to fly with as many as 500 , and potentially 800 , people around them : this is a plane that will have four aisles .
more passengers per plane could create the potential for delays .
and that is a big issue , especially when added to the increased security procedures on the ground .
perhaps to avoid criticism that its plane is designed to be ' cattle-class ' , airbus has carefully marketed the a380 as a luxurious way to travel , its promo videos oozing spacious inflight shopping , showers , bars , and libraries .
the full size mock-up of the plane in toulouse , france , even has an onboard waterfall .
there is space for all this , but it is a brave airline that does n't fill that space with more seats .
no competition as the production of the first a380 begins , hopes are high that it will be a business success .
plenty of space may come at a cost for passengers the share price of eads , the airbus majority shareholder , has risen as a result .
but the a380 is partly flying high because it does n't have an obvious competitor .
boeing , the creator of the 747 , pulled out of the race to build the world 's biggest airline in 2001 .
instead , boeing is offering airlines an alternative model rather than building them big , it has decided to target the middle of the aircraft market .
its new 7e7 dreamliner was launched in april .
airlines ' dilemma dreamliner is designed to replace the existing 757 and 767 airliners which are getting old .
because it is smaller , carrying 230-300 passengers , it is arguably more flexible than the a380 .
boeing believes the 7e7 can serve both short and long-haul routes .
" big jet ranges , with smaller jet sizes , " as the company puts it .
this will be good for airlines that want to fly more planes to smaller destinations .
it will allow passengers to travel direct , without the need to change .
so an intriguing question presents itself : will the airline industry of the future want the build- ' em-big , pack- ' em-in a380 , or the all-things-to-all-airlines 7e7 ?
new chapter it is of course quite possible that they will want both .
but it is worth noting that the first order for the 7e7 was from japan 's all nippon airways .
japanese carriers have been reluctant to sign up for a380s .
whatever happens , airbus has the head start .

by tom symonds bbc transport correspondent a truly enormous plane , an even bigger hangar to build it in , talk of a revolution in air travel , extravagant promises of airborne casinos , bars and shops .
we 've been here before .
rising demand for air travel makes larger aircraft viable as the assembly of the airbus a380 super-airliner begins , it is becoming apparent that in many ways its advent is just history repeating itself .
back in the mid 60s , almost the same claims were made for the boeing 747 jumbo jet .
it would carry more passengers , 400 to be precise , and enable airlines to slash costs .
but the a380 has been designed for its time , and that means building- ' em-big .
environmental credentials there has been a huge increase in demand for air travel .
with twin decks running the length of the plane , there will be staircases at the front and rear in pictures : from drawing board to production this allows airlines to use even bigger planes than the 747 , with less fear that they may fly with empty seats .
the size of the a380 means it can take a third more passengers than a jumbo jet , about 555 people , so that fewer flights will be needed to carry the same number of passengers .
slots in and out of major hub airports are at a premium .
and in the uk particularly , there 's pressure to limit airport expansion .
airbus also promotes the a380 's environmental credentials - it does 95 miles to the gallon per passenger .
the a380 thus consumes less fuel per passenger than its competitors .
where the parts come from it is a sales pitch that has attracted orders from 11 international airlines , a total of 129 a380s to date .
airbus is keen to build an upmarket image for the giant aircraft but what sort of business model are they signing up to ?
put simply , a380s will fly to around 60 big airports around the world , the hubs .
after all , it is a big plane and not all airports can handle it .
crucially , passengers wanting to get to smaller cities will have to transfer .
luxury airlines will have to convince passengers they want to fly with as many as 500 , and potentially 800 , people around them : this is a plane that will have four aisles .
more passengers per plane could create the potential for delays .
and that is a big issue , especially when added to the increased security procedures on the ground .
perhaps to avoid criticism that its plane is designed to be ' cattle-class ' , airbus has carefully marketed the a380 as a luxurious way to travel , its promo videos oozing spacious inflight shopping , showers , bars , and libraries .
the full size mock-up of the plane in toulouse , france , even has an onboard waterfall .
there is space for all this , but it is a brave airline that does n't fill that space with more seats .
no competition as the production of the first a380 begins , hopes are high that it will be a business success .
plenty of space may come at a cost for passengers the share price of eads , the airbus majority shareholder , has risen as a result .
but the a380 is partly flying high because it does n't have an obvious competitor .
boeing , the creator of the 747 , pulled out of the race to build the world 's biggest airline in 2001 .
instead , boeing is offering airlines an alternative model rather than building them big , it has decided to target the middle of the aircraft market .
its new 7e7 dreamliner was launched in april .
airlines ' dilemma dreamliner is designed to replace the existing 757 and 767 airliners which are getting old .
because it is smaller , carrying 230-300 passengers , it is arguably more flexible than the a380 .
boeing believes the 7e7 can serve both short and long-haul routes .
" big jet ranges , with smaller jet sizes , " as the company puts it .
this will be good for airlines that want to fly more planes to smaller destinations .
it will allow passengers to travel direct , without the need to change .
so an intriguing question presents itself : will the airline industry of the future want the build- ' em-big , pack- ' em-in a380 , or the all-things-to-all-airlines 7e7 ?
new chapter it is of course quite possible that they will want both .
but it is worth noting that the first order for the 7e7 was from japan 's all nippon airways .
japanese carriers have been reluctant to sign up for a380s .
whatever happens , airbus has the head start .
the factory to show off , the full order book , and a date for the first a380 to go into service .
in 2006 a new chapter will begin in the history of air travel .

but not in the tiny baltic nation of estonia , where democracy is running about as close to real-time as you can get .
visiting delegations get a taste of estonia 's parliament estonia 's cabinet meetings are a good example .
each week , government ministers gather at a few long , grey tables in a seemingly spartan room not far from the country 's parliament building .
the walls of the room may be mostly bare , but the tables certainly are not .
spaced at intervals along the table tops are sleek , flat-panel monitors , one for each minister .
underneath the desks are high-end computers , each hard-wired to the internet via broadband connections .
the day 's agenda is displayed on a giant projection screen .
any cabinet member who happens to be travelling can participate in the meeting via instant messaging .
as the meeting progresses , press officers send updates to the estonian government 's website .
in the space of 30 seconds , government decisions are made available to any estonian citizen with an internet connection .
young blood none of this seems outrageously hi-tech here in estonia .
the cabinet 's been holding meetings like this since the year 2000 .
the decision to open up the workings of government in this way stretch back to 1992 , when estonia achieved independence .
" during soviet times , the whole system was closed , " said tex vertmann , a technology adviser to the estonian government .
what we mostly teach is understanding what your goals are as a government , and then figuring out how technology can help you achieve those goals ant sild , e-governance academy " so we opened our system , because people demanded it .
and i think citizens are quite happy with it . "
the process was helped along , mr vertmann said , by the fact that each of the estonian governments formed since independence have included younger ministers open to trying new ways of doing things .
" they are interested in looking at the future , " he said .
" they know how to use new technology , and they know about the benefits they can get from these new technologies . "
the push for e-government has made the estonian government more efficient .
cabinet meetings that used to take up to 10 hours , now run on average about 45 minutes .
web technologies have also helped make the estonian government more transparent .
citizens can now log into a government internet portal called today , i decide .
on the site , estonians can comment on government policies , both domestic and foreign .
" every person can send in ideas and proposals in any field , " said estonia 's foreign minister kristiina ojuland .
" if there are really important proposals , serious proposals , then those are sent to the relevant ministries .
and there have been cases where we 've changed our legislation based on those proposals coming from citizens . "
teaching others problems do remain , however , in getting estonians interested and online .
although more than 700 free internet access points exist across the country , and wi-fi is stretching out into the countryside , many estonians still do not have access to the internet .
some do not even know how to use a computer .
officials from nearby countries have been trained in estonia one group trying to change that is the look @ world foundation .
it has just completed a two-year programme which saw more than 100,000 estonian adults , a tenth of estonia 's population , trained on using computers and the internet .
" the real benefits of the internet start only when the majority of the population starts using it , " said alar ehandi , chairman of the look @ world foundation .
" the more people that are online , the more services citizens can get via the internet .
that makes the state more efficient , and more transparent . "
now , the estonian e-government model is getting worldwide attention .
a recent study by harvard university placed estonia in fifth position worldwide when it comes to the development of e-government .
other studies rank estonia in the global top 10 in terms of online environment and " e-readiness . "
regional leader in the last few years , officials from other former soviet bloc countries have approached estonian officials and asked how they might adapt the baltic nation 's concepts of e-government to their own political systems .
the ministers can do anything they want during the cabinet meetings .
they can read news or check their e-mail tex vertmann , technology adviser with financial help from the soros foundation and the united nations development programme , the estonian government formally created the e-governance academy about 18 months ago to do just that .
ants sild , a program manager for training at the e-governance academy , said the focus of the training was not on technology , but rather " mind-set change training . "
" what we mostly teach , " said mr sild , " is understanding what your goals are as a government , and then figuring out how technology can help you achieve those goals .
" but then you need to figure out how to manage the technology , and the changes that the technology brings . "
lure of the net to date , officials from such countries as tajikistan , uzbekistan , moldova , ukraine , and even mongolia have all gone through training at the academy .
mr sild is proud that estonia 's advances in e-government can serve as a model elsewhere .
" we want to have impact , " he said .
" you ca n't go back to the autocratic rules that were common in the last century . "
but going hi-tech still offers the occasional challenge to estonia 's government ministers , according to advisor tex vertmann .
during cabinet meetings , officials sometimes get lured away by the internet 's less political offerings .
" the ministers can do anything they want during the cabinet meetings , " said mr vertmann .
" they can read news or check their e-mail . "
" and yes , " he added laughing , " some ministers read jokes online or something like that .
they 're only human . "

visiting delegations get a taste of estonia 's parliament estonia 's cabinet meetings are a good example .
each week , government ministers gather at a few long , grey tables in a seemingly spartan room not far from the country 's parliament building .
the walls of the room may be mostly bare , but the tables certainly are not .
spaced at intervals along the table tops are sleek , flat-panel monitors , one for each minister .
underneath the desks are high-end computers , each hard-wired to the internet via broadband connections .
the day 's agenda is displayed on a giant projection screen .
any cabinet member who happens to be travelling can participate in the meeting via instant messaging .
as the meeting progresses , press officers send updates to the estonian government 's website .
in the space of 30 seconds , government decisions are made available to any estonian citizen with an internet connection .
young blood none of this seems outrageously hi-tech here in estonia .
the cabinet 's been holding meetings like this since the year 2000 .
the decision to open up the workings of government in this way stretch back to 1992 , when estonia achieved independence .
" during soviet times , the whole system was closed , " said tex vertmann , a technology adviser to the estonian government .
what we mostly teach is understanding what your goals are as a government , and then figuring out how technology can help you achieve those goals ant sild , e-governance academy " so we opened our system , because people demanded it .
and i think citizens are quite happy with it . "
the process was helped along , mr vertmann said , by the fact that each of the estonian governments formed since independence have included younger ministers open to trying new ways of doing things .
" they are interested in looking at the future , " he said .
" they know how to use new technology , and they know about the benefits they can get from these new technologies . "
the push for e-government has made the estonian government more efficient .
cabinet meetings that used to take up to 10 hours , now run on average about 45 minutes .
web technologies have also helped make the estonian government more transparent .
citizens can now log into a government internet portal called today , i decide .
on the site , estonians can comment on government policies , both domestic and foreign .
" every person can send in ideas and proposals in any field , " said estonia 's foreign minister kristiina ojuland .
" if there are really important proposals , serious proposals , then those are sent to the relevant ministries .
and there have been cases where we 've changed our legislation based on those proposals coming from citizens . "
teaching others problems do remain , however , in getting estonians interested and online .
although more than 700 free internet access points exist across the country , and wi-fi is stretching out into the countryside , many estonians still do not have access to the internet .
some do not even know how to use a computer .
officials from nearby countries have been trained in estonia one group trying to change that is the look @ world foundation .
it has just completed a two-year programme which saw more than 100,000 estonian adults , a tenth of estonia 's population , trained on using computers and the internet .
" the real benefits of the internet start only when the majority of the population starts using it , " said alar ehandi , chairman of the look @ world foundation .
" the more people that are online , the more services citizens can get via the internet .
that makes the state more efficient , and more transparent . "
now , the estonian e-government model is getting worldwide attention .
a recent study by harvard university placed estonia in fifth position worldwide when it comes to the development of e-government .
other studies rank estonia in the global top 10 in terms of online environment and " e-readiness . "
regional leader in the last few years , officials from other former soviet bloc countries have approached estonian officials and asked how they might adapt the baltic nation 's concepts of e-government to their own political systems .
the ministers can do anything they want during the cabinet meetings .
they can read news or check their e-mail tex vertmann , technology adviser with financial help from the soros foundation and the united nations development programme , the estonian government formally created the e-governance academy about 18 months ago to do just that .
ants sild , a program manager for training at the e-governance academy , said the focus of the training was not on technology , but rather " mind-set change training . "
" what we mostly teach , " said mr sild , " is understanding what your goals are as a government , and then figuring out how technology can help you achieve those goals .
" but then you need to figure out how to manage the technology , and the changes that the technology brings . "
lure of the net to date , officials from such countries as tajikistan , uzbekistan , moldova , ukraine , and even mongolia have all gone through training at the academy .
mr sild is proud that estonia 's advances in e-government can serve as a model elsewhere .
" we want to have impact , " he said .
" you ca n't go back to the autocratic rules that were common in the last century . "
but going hi-tech still offers the occasional challenge to estonia 's government ministers , according to advisor tex vertmann .
during cabinet meetings , officials sometimes get lured away by the internet 's less political offerings .
" the ministers can do anything they want during the cabinet meetings , " said mr vertmann .
" they can read news or check their e-mail . "
" and yes , " he added laughing , " some ministers read jokes online or something like that .
they 're only human . "

on the site , estonians can comment on government policies , both domestic and foreign .
" every person can send in ideas and proposals in any field , " said estonia 's foreign minister kristiina ojuland .
" if there are really important proposals , serious proposals , then those are sent to the relevant ministries .
and there have been cases where we 've changed our legislation based on those proposals coming from citizens . "
teaching others problems do remain , however , in getting estonians interested and online .
although more than 700 free internet access points exist across the country , and wi-fi is stretching out into the countryside , many estonians still do not have access to the internet .
some do not even know how to use a computer .
officials from nearby countries have been trained in estonia one group trying to change that is the look @ world foundation .
it has just completed a two-year programme which saw more than 100,000 estonian adults , a tenth of estonia 's population , trained on using computers and the internet .
" the real benefits of the internet start only when the majority of the population starts using it , " said alar ehandi , chairman of the look @ world foundation .
" the more people that are online , the more services citizens can get via the internet .
that makes the state more efficient , and more transparent . "
now , the estonian e-government model is getting worldwide attention .
a recent study by harvard university placed estonia in fifth position worldwide when it comes to the development of e-government .
other studies rank estonia in the global top 10 in terms of online environment and " e-readiness . "
regional leader in the last few years , officials from other former soviet bloc countries have approached estonian officials and asked how they might adapt the baltic nation 's concepts of e-government to their own political systems .
the ministers can do anything they want during the cabinet meetings .
they can read news or check their e-mail tex vertmann , technology adviser with financial help from the soros foundation and the united nations development programme , the estonian government formally created the e-governance academy about 18 months ago to do just that .
ants sild , a program manager for training at the e-governance academy , said the focus of the training was not on technology , but rather " mind-set change training . "
" what we mostly teach , " said mr sild , " is understanding what your goals are as a government , and then figuring out how technology can help you achieve those goals .
" but then you need to figure out how to manage the technology , and the changes that the technology brings . "
lure of the net to date , officials from such countries as tajikistan , uzbekistan , moldova , ukraine , and even mongolia have all gone through training at the academy .
mr sild is proud that estonia 's advances in e-government can serve as a model elsewhere .
" we want to have impact , " he said .
" you ca n't go back to the autocratic rules that were common in the last century . "
but going hi-tech still offers the occasional challenge to estonia 's government ministers , according to advisor tex vertmann .
during cabinet meetings , officials sometimes get lured away by the internet 's less political offerings .
" the ministers can do anything they want during the cabinet meetings , " said mr vertmann .
" they can read news or check their e-mail . "
" and yes , " he added laughing , " some ministers read jokes online or something like that .
they 're only human . "

but going hi-tech still offers the occasional challenge to estonia 's government ministers , according to advisor tex vertmann .
during cabinet meetings , officials sometimes get lured away by the internet 's less political offerings .
" the ministers can do anything they want during the cabinet meetings , " said mr vertmann .
" they can read news or check their e-mail . "
" and yes , " he added laughing , " some ministers read jokes online or something like that .
they 're only human . "

it says over a quarter of beds in welsh hospitals are occupied by people who do not need to be there .
however the audit commission found a recent fall in the number of patients waiting over 18 months for treatment was encouraging .
health minister jane hutt said the findings reinforced policies being followed in wales .
but conservatives in the assembly are calling for her to resign , claiming the report points to taxpayers ' money being wasted .
the report , entitled transforming health and social care in wales , describes deep-seated problems in the ways the health service is run .
it has called for urgent action to reduce the numbers of beds in wales being blocked through delays in transferring patients elsewhere .
failure to take the opportunity to accomplish better performance and make essential reforms would mean " continuing unsustainability in health services and serious consequences for confidence in other public services " , it says .
jane hutt allocated £ 4m towards tackling bed-blocking following the recommendations of the wanless report into the welsh health service in 2003 .
she says work on the problem is ongoing .
" work is already well under way in the areas highlighted in the report .
" for example , all 22 local wanless action plans have now been received from local health boards and are being considered , " she said .
speaking to bbc wales , she added : " derek wanless said we need joined-up health and social care - that 's what we have got with the local health boards .
" let 's give the health service a chance to deliver on these recommendations . "
clive grace , director general of the audit commission in wales , said : " health services in wales deliver a high volume of care despite considerable pressures and an inefficient configuration of services .
" recent signs of reductions in waiting list figures are clearly to be welcomed but the current situation is a manifestation of deep seated system problems - national , local , political , managerial and clinical .
" that is why we see the responsibility for solving these problems as equally wide-ranging , and urgent .
" we want to get across how services need to change to deliver the health care system which wales deserves . "
' damning ' tory assembly health spokesman jonathan morgan said the report " completely undermines the position of jane hutt " .
" it is highly critical of government policy and the direction of the nhs under labour since 1999 .
" on this basis , with yet another damning report into her stewardship of the health service , i fail to see how she can continue in office for any longer . "
shadow health minister , plaid cymru 's rhodri glyn thomas called ms hutt a " semi-detached " minister who needed to give urgent attention to health management in wales .
" creating different strategies in the various local health boards is n't working .
" what we need is a national strategy of health provision in wales , " he added .

" i would urge more schools to follow the positive examples set out in today 's report in order to help pupils of bangladeshi heritage achieve more educational success in the future . "
ministers welcomed the report but said there was still more to do .
ofsted said it had timed its report to coincide with one of the uk 's foremost asian festivals , the baishaki mela , which this weekend celebrates the bengali new year in london 's " banglatown " , centred on the spitalfields area .

bruce greig , boss of 0800handyman , in south london , says his workers were often fined for parking on footpaths .
he says tickets are issued if one or more wheels touches the path , so the stand raises the scooter off the ground .

if local authorities persist in using parking laws to raise revenue , not to manage traffic , then people like me will persist in making their life as difficult as possible bruce greig , 0800handyman he acknowledges the scooters would need to be parked sensibly so as not to cause obstructions , but argues increased use would take pressure off public transport and ease congestion .
mr greig said : " it is clearly ludicrous that such a loophole exists - the law is very badly drafted .

the screening programme has been running for 13 years at an annual cost of £ 43,000 .
men aged 65 are tested using ultra-sound scans .
