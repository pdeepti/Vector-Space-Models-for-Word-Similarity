program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.04.2004 eu ministers support " battle group " peacekeeping plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-led peacekeeping force in congo last year is the model for the eu .
eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs .

instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs . " rebuilding the east is responsible for at least two thirds of germany 's weak growth .
as it stands now , germany can not revive itself , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the study , chronically high unemployment near 20 percent in the eastern states has led to mass migration of the young and educated , which is exacerbating the region 's problems . commissioned by the economy ministry and the transport ministry , which is responsible for eastern reconstruction plans , the report calls for a dramatic restructuring of how aid is allotted in the region .
instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .
" we have to readjust things anew , " he told german radio station mdr info . conservative eastern officials including saxony 's premier georg milbradt have called for radically restructuring the region to make it more attractive to businesses .
however , plans to make the eastern states a " special economic zone " have not been greeted by all politicians with such enthusiasm . " that is a completely unrealistic perspective that we should quickly bury , " said leader of the greens reinhard bütikofer , according to the associated press .

just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .
wippit recently started offering downloads for a mere € .39 per song and has plans to launch in germany soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .
wippit recently started offering downloads for a mere € .39 per song and has plans to launch in germany soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

the 18-year-old student had demanded a minimum of € 1,700 each month to fund the lifestyle she felt was entitled to , which included two vacations per year , a computer and a car worth € 7,000 .
support levels for dependents in germany are set by the so-called " düsseldorfer table , " and her father , who has a monthly income of € 15,000 , had been paying her € 865 prior to her becoming a legal adult at 18 .
the presiding judges at the nuremberg court rejected her claim on the grounds her expectations were excessive and would only encourage her to try and support herself . more briefs 06.04.2004 -pipe- genetically modified wheat planted in germany 06.04.2004 -pipe- criminal police chief wants more say in anti-terror fight 05.04.2004 -pipe- college refuses admission to former sept .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

the u.s. reality soap " the simple life " starring heiress paris hilton is a big hit on german tv .
but the import is n't enough , and germany is getting its own version - complete with blonde glamour girl . germany 's answer to paris hilton might not be as famous as the american hotel heiress who 's made a career out of flaunting her extravagant lifestyle , but judith kamps , the daughter of millionaire bakery king heiner kamps , is prepared to give hilton a run for her money . " we 're both blonde , spoiled , and like to shop , " she says .
for her , that 's where the similarities end : " paris is an airhead , whereas i 'm studying fashion design at a private college in düsseldorf . " well , there is one more similarity .
following in hilton 's footsteps , kamps is about to trade in her gucci shoes for a pair of galoshes and get down home on the farm for the german version of " the simple life .

never mind what this says about the ability of german media executives to come up with their own hit formats - the foreign imports are popular with viewers , and that means big bucks for the broadcasters lucky enough to nab them . quiz shows such as " who wants to be a millionaire , " talent shows such as " star search , " and reality shows such as " the bachelor , " and " big brother " have all been germanized .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .
since sept .
11 , inbound overseas travel to the u.s. has declined by 30 percent .
the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia -rrb- does n't want to see those numbers decline further , and issued a statement on friday .
" while we appreciate the rationale for the federal government 's action , tia is nonetheless greatly disappointed and very concerned about potential negative reactions in key inbound tourism markets from western europe , japan and other important visa waiver countries , " said william s. norman , president and ceo of the tia .
indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .
at issue is the extent of the data transfer .
european parliament representatives feel only 19 categories of data should be relayed , instead of the 34 negotiated by the commission .
according to the resolution , " such access is illegal under member state and eu privacy laws . "

visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .
since sept .

the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia -rrb- does n't want to see those numbers decline further , and issued a statement on friday .
" while we appreciate the rationale for the federal government 's action , tia is nonetheless greatly disappointed and very concerned about potential negative reactions in key inbound tourism markets from western europe , japan and other important visa waiver countries , " said william s. norman , president and ceo of the tia .
indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .
at issue is the extent of the data transfer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.04.2004 kraut goes classy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly haute cuisine it 's long had a bad rap as a sidekick to greasy sausages or significant chunks of a pig 's leg , but sauerkraut is not just a boring accompaniment to the heavier types of german food , as aficionados are trying to prove . the kraut itself , of course , is actually quite healthy , as producers of the delicacy will gladly point out .
it contains few calories and a lot of vitamin c and is even supposed to aid digestion as the " intestine 's broom . "
too few people seem to accept this , however , and 40 sauerkraut connoisseurs from germany , france , the netherlands and italy recently met to come up with ways to change that .
meeting in marlenheim , just east of strasbourg in the alsace region of france , chefs and kraut makers exchanged ideas to lift pickled cabbage to new heights as a peppermint sauerkraut sorbet or a basis for sushi .
it 's a difficult undertaking , according to eckart hengstenberg , a member of one of germany 's leading sauerkraut dynasties and president of the european association of sauerkraut producers .
" it 's just not that easy to change eating habits , " he told afp news wire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.04.2004 u.s. decides to fingerprint european travelers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in september , european visitors will be digitally fingerprinted .
visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .
since sept .
11 , inbound overseas travel to the u.s. has declined by 30 percent .
the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia -rrb- does n't want to see those numbers decline further , and issued a statement on friday .
" while we appreciate the rationale for the federal government 's action , tia is nonetheless greatly disappointed and very concerned about potential negative reactions in key inbound tourism markets from western europe , japan and other important visa waiver countries , " said william s. norman , president and ceo of the tia .
indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .
at issue is the extent of the data transfer .
european parliament representatives feel only 19 categories of data should be relayed , instead of the 34 negotiated by the commission .
according to the resolution , " such access is illegal under member state and eu privacy laws . "
both sides will continue to debate the issue this week . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de look me in the eye forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

it contains few calories and a lot of vitamin c and is even supposed to aid digestion as the " intestine 's broom . "
too few people seem to accept this , however , and 40 sauerkraut connoisseurs from germany , france , the netherlands and italy recently met to come up with ways to change that .
meeting in marlenheim , just east of strasbourg in the alsace region of france , chefs and kraut makers exchanged ideas to lift pickled cabbage to new heights as a peppermint sauerkraut sorbet or a basis for sushi .
it 's a difficult undertaking , according to eckart hengstenberg , a member of one of germany 's leading sauerkraut dynasties and president of the european association of sauerkraut producers .
" it 's just not that easy to change eating habits , " he told afp news wire .
hengstenberg and his colleagues have every reason to push kraut as a tasty delicacy .
the average frenchman for example only eats about 800 grams -lrb- 28.2 oz . -rrb- per year - one fifth less than a decade ago .
germans , on the other hand , have remained faithful to their alleged national side dish -lrb- which was actually imported from china -rrb- : they 're still eating about 3.2 kg -lrb- 112.8 oz . -rrb- a year .
come may , the eu 's new eastern european member states might help to boost kraut business again .
but a touch of haute cuisine seems unnecessary there : poles , czechs and slovaks do n't seem to have a problem with enjoying their cabbage with a deliciously greasy fried sausage .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

" german broadcaster rtl is planning its own take on the u.s. series , which became an immediate hit when it started airing here last month on rtl 's competitor , prosieben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris hilton and nicole richie german audiences ca n't seem to get enough of paris hilton and gal pal nicole richie -lrb- daughter of singer lionel richie -rrb- as they struggle to survive everyday life on an arkansas farm . knock-off success by the end of this summer , they 'll be able to ogle kamps , along with her sidekick , indira , ex-singer of pop group bro 'sis .
ironically , that band was the product of another german reality show , " popstars , " which , like " the simple life " , was also an imported format that was previously successful in britain and the u.s. the german television landscape is teeming with u.s. and british knock-offs , though rarely , if ever , does it work the other way round .
never mind what this says about the ability of german media executives to come up with their own hit formats - the foreign imports are popular with viewers , and that means big bucks for the broadcasters lucky enough to nab them . quiz shows such as " who wants to be a millionaire , " talent shows such as " star search , " and reality shows such as " the bachelor , " and " big brother " have all been germanized .
even mtv 's catty dating show " dismissed " has got in on the act . dirty and sweaty ? so bring on " the simple life " and judith kamps , who , it seems , has been working on her best paris hilton impression when thinking about what lies in store for her on the farm . " the worst thing would be to have to help out with birthing a calf .
how disgusting ! " she said in an interview with the german tabloid bild am sonntag .
" i 'm scared we 're going to be running around dirty and sweaty all the time . " preparation is everything , and kamps has the advantage of acquainting herself with the original show before her own two-month trial begins .
so unlike hilton , kamps already knows she 's better off leaving her stilettos at home .
she plans on taking rubber boots instead .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

the 18-year-old student had demanded a minimum of € 1,700 each month to fund the lifestyle she felt was entitled to , which included two vacations per year , a computer and a car worth € 7,000 .
support levels for dependents in germany are set by the so-called " düsseldorfer table , " and her father , who has a monthly income of € 15,000 , had been paying her € 865 prior to her becoming a legal adult at 18 .
the presiding judges at the nuremberg court rejected her claim on the grounds her expectations were excessive and would only encourage her to try and support herself . more briefs 06.04.2004 -pipe- genetically modified wheat planted in germany 06.04.2004 -pipe- criminal police chief wants more say in anti-terror fight 05.04.2004 -pipe- college refuses admission to former sept .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .
wippit recently started offering downloads for a mere € .39 per song and has plans to launch in germany soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .
wippit recently started offering downloads for a mere € .39 per song and has plans to launch in germany soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

it contains few calories and a lot of vitamin c and is even supposed to aid digestion as the " intestine 's broom . "
too few people seem to accept this , however , and 40 sauerkraut connoisseurs from germany , france , the netherlands and italy recently met to come up with ways to change that .
meeting in marlenheim , just east of strasbourg in the alsace region of france , chefs and kraut makers exchanged ideas to lift pickled cabbage to new heights as a peppermint sauerkraut sorbet or a basis for sushi .
it 's a difficult undertaking , according to eckart hengstenberg , a member of one of germany 's leading sauerkraut dynasties and president of the european association of sauerkraut producers .
" it 's just not that easy to change eating habits , " he told afp news wire .
hengstenberg and his colleagues have every reason to push kraut as a tasty delicacy .
the average frenchman for example only eats about 800 grams -lrb- 28.2 oz . -rrb- per year - one fifth less than a decade ago .
germans , on the other hand , have remained faithful to their alleged national side dish -lrb- which was actually imported from china -rrb- : they 're still eating about 3.2 kg -lrb- 112.8 oz . -rrb- a year .
come may , the eu 's new eastern european member states might help to boost kraut business again .
but a touch of haute cuisine seems unnecessary there : poles , czechs and slovaks do n't seem to have a problem with enjoying their cabbage with a deliciously greasy fried sausage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2004 german online music platform 's troubled first weeks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phonoline is facing stiff competition .
just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .
wippit recently started offering downloads for a mere € .39 per song and has plans to launch in germany soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs . " rebuilding the east is responsible for at least two thirds of germany 's weak growth .

instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .
" we have to readjust things anew , " he told german radio station mdr info . conservative eastern officials including saxony 's premier georg milbradt have called for radically restructuring the region to make it more attractive to businesses .
however , plans to make the eastern states a " special economic zone " have not been greeted by all politicians with such enthusiasm . " that is a completely unrealistic perspective that we should quickly bury , " said leader of the greens reinhard bütikofer , according to the associated press .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs . " rebuilding the east is responsible for at least two thirds of germany 's weak growth .

instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .

austrian environmentalists are in the middle of a three-day blockade of key motorways .
they 're protesting against increased truck traffic they say is polluting the alpine countryside . environmental activists continued their protest action on tuesday against what they call austria 's " traffic avalanche , " blocking several highways for up to five hours at a time .
they plan to expand the action on wednesday , blocking motorways in the austrian provinces of tyrol , salzburg , carinthia and lower austria for 12 hours . turnout so far has been low but good-natured , with families taking advantage of the blockade to ride their bicycles along roads normally choked with heavy transport trucks .
in lower austria , groups of protesters picknicked while listening to live music , including the song " highway to hell .

the country 's transport minister , hubert gorbach , said the protests are sending an important signal to the eu in brussels " the people who live here and who are plagued by the traffic have made the problem visible to the eu , " he said . but the protest action also met with criticism because of its timing .
the week leading up to easter typically means extra traffic on the roads as people go on holiday .

in addition to the millions of cars , approximately 1.8 million transport trucks roll across its transit motorways each year .
the pollution emissions along these routes that cut through the country 's beautiful alpine landscape regularly exceed the permissible level . the transit routes are likely to become even more important when the eu expands to include eastern neighbors czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia next month .
experts warn that the amount of traffic on austrian motorways could double in the next year . austria is dissatisfied with a compromise ruling adopted by eu ministers in brussels last year that reduces the restrictions on heavy goods traffic that austria had negotiated when it joined the eu in 1995 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.04.2004 germany seeking the simple life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bakery heiress judith kamps is germany 's paris hilton .
the u.s. reality soap " the simple life " starring heiress paris hilton is a big hit on german tv .
but the import is n't enough , and germany is getting its own version - complete with blonde glamour girl . germany 's answer to paris hilton might not be as famous as the american hotel heiress who 's made a career out of flaunting her extravagant lifestyle , but judith kamps , the daughter of millionaire bakery king heiner kamps , is prepared to give hilton a run for her money . " we 're both blonde , spoiled , and like to shop , " she says .
for her , that 's where the similarities end : " paris is an airhead , whereas i 'm studying fashion design at a private college in düsseldorf . " well , there is one more similarity .
following in hilton 's footsteps , kamps is about to trade in her gucci shoes for a pair of galoshes and get down home on the farm for the german version of " the simple life . " german broadcaster rtl is planning its own take on the u.s. series , which became an immediate hit when it started airing here last month on rtl 's competitor , prosieben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris hilton and nicole richie german audiences ca n't seem to get enough of paris hilton and gal pal nicole richie -lrb- daughter of singer lionel richie -rrb- as they struggle to survive everyday life on an arkansas farm . knock-off success by the end of this summer , they 'll be able to ogle kamps , along with her sidekick , indira , ex-singer of pop group bro 'sis .
ironically , that band was the product of another german reality show , " popstars , " which , like " the simple life " , was also an imported format that was previously successful in britain and the u.s. the german television landscape is teeming with u.s. and british knock-offs , though rarely , if ever , does it work the other way round .
never mind what this says about the ability of german media executives to come up with their own hit formats - the foreign imports are popular with viewers , and that means big bucks for the broadcasters lucky enough to nab them . quiz shows such as " who wants to be a millionaire , " talent shows such as " star search , " and reality shows such as " the bachelor , " and " big brother " have all been germanized .
even mtv 's catty dating show " dismissed " has got in on the act . dirty and sweaty ? so bring on " the simple life " and judith kamps , who , it seems , has been working on her best paris hilton impression when thinking about what lies in store for her on the farm . " the worst thing would be to have to help out with birthing a calf .
how disgusting ! " she said in an interview with the german tabloid bild am sonntag .
" i 'm scared we 're going to be running around dirty and sweaty all the time . " preparation is everything , and kamps has the advantage of acquainting herself with the original show before her own two-month trial begins .
so unlike hilton , kamps already knows she 's better off leaving her stilettos at home .

austrian environmentalists are in the middle of a three-day blockade of key motorways .
they 're protesting against increased truck traffic they say is polluting the alpine countryside . environmental activists continued their protest action on tuesday against what they call austria 's " traffic avalanche , " blocking several highways for up to five hours at a time .
they plan to expand the action on wednesday , blocking motorways in the austrian provinces of tyrol , salzburg , carinthia and lower austria for 12 hours . turnout so far has been low but good-natured , with families taking advantage of the blockade to ride their bicycles along roads normally choked with heavy transport trucks .
in lower austria , groups of protesters picknicked while listening to live music , including the song " highway to hell . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party atmosphere prevails at sites where blockades have been mounted . traffic is being diverted along alternate routes , and so far , austrian police say they 've managed to avoid large traffic jams . politicians sympathetic austrian politicians have expressed understanding for the three-day blockade .
the country 's transport minister , hubert gorbach , said the protests are sending an important signal to the eu in brussels " the people who live here and who are plagued by the traffic have made the problem visible to the eu , " he said . but the protest action also met with criticism because of its timing .
the week leading up to easter typically means extra traffic on the roads as people go on holiday .
the head of the economic association of tyrol , jürgen bodenseer , said the blockades were only damaging tyrol 's tourism industry . major transit zone austria is a major transit zone with four mountain passes linking northern and southern europe .
in addition to the millions of cars , approximately 1.8 million transport trucks roll across its transit motorways each year .
the pollution emissions along these routes that cut through the country 's beautiful alpine landscape regularly exceed the permissible level . the transit routes are likely to become even more important when the eu expands to include eastern neighbors czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia next month .
experts warn that the amount of traffic on austrian motorways could double in the next year . austria is dissatisfied with a compromise ruling adopted by eu ministers in brussels last year that reduces the restrictions on heavy goods traffic that austria had negotiated when it joined the eu in 1995 .
to encourage the use of more environmentally-friendly vehicles , the eu granted cleaner trucks unrestricted access .
austria says the compromise allows 80 percent of vehicles in transit to cross through the country freely without being subject to any quotas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de successful road toll models in europe after months of delays , the german toll collect experiment is now on hold and the contract with its proposed operator in tatters .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs . " rebuilding the east is responsible for at least two thirds of germany 's weak growth .
as it stands now , germany can not revive itself , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the study , chronically high unemployment near 20 percent in the eastern states has led to mass migration of the young and educated , which is exacerbating the region 's problems . commissioned by the economy ministry and the transport ministry , which is responsible for eastern reconstruction plans , the report calls for a dramatic restructuring of how aid is allotted in the region .
instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .
" we have to readjust things anew , " he told german radio station mdr info . conservative eastern officials including saxony 's premier georg milbradt have called for radically restructuring the region to make it more attractive to businesses .
however , plans to make the eastern states a " special economic zone " have not been greeted by all politicians with such enthusiasm . " that is a completely unrealistic perspective that we should quickly bury , " said leader of the greens reinhard bütikofer , according to the associated press .
bütikofer and others see major legal difficulties in implementing a special zone , since there would be conflicts with both german and eu labor and tax codes . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs . " rebuilding the east is responsible for at least two thirds of germany 's weak growth .
as it stands now , germany can not revive itself , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the study , chronically high unemployment near 20 percent in the eastern states has led to mass migration of the young and educated , which is exacerbating the region 's problems . commissioned by the economy ministry and the transport ministry , which is responsible for eastern reconstruction plans , the report calls for a dramatic restructuring of how aid is allotted in the region .
instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .
" we have to readjust things anew , " he told german radio station mdr info . conservative eastern officials including saxony 's premier georg milbradt have called for radically restructuring the region to make it more attractive to businesses .
however , plans to make the eastern states a " special economic zone " have not been greeted by all politicians with such enthusiasm . " that is a completely unrealistic perspective that we should quickly bury , " said leader of the greens reinhard bütikofer , according to the associated press .
bütikofer and others see major legal difficulties in implementing a special zone , since there would be conflicts with both german and eu labor and tax codes . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.04.2004 germany seeking the simple life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bakery heiress judith kamps is germany 's paris hilton .
the u.s. reality soap " the simple life " starring heiress paris hilton is a big hit on german tv .
but the import is n't enough , and germany is getting its own version - complete with blonde glamour girl . germany 's answer to paris hilton might not be as famous as the american hotel heiress who 's made a career out of flaunting her extravagant lifestyle , but judith kamps , the daughter of millionaire bakery king heiner kamps , is prepared to give hilton a run for her money . " we 're both blonde , spoiled , and like to shop , " she says .
for her , that 's where the similarities end : " paris is an airhead , whereas i 'm studying fashion design at a private college in düsseldorf . " well , there is one more similarity .
following in hilton 's footsteps , kamps is about to trade in her gucci shoes for a pair of galoshes and get down home on the farm for the german version of " the simple life . " german broadcaster rtl is planning its own take on the u.s. series , which became an immediate hit when it started airing here last month on rtl 's competitor , prosieben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris hilton and nicole richie german audiences ca n't seem to get enough of paris hilton and gal pal nicole richie -lrb- daughter of singer lionel richie -rrb- as they struggle to survive everyday life on an arkansas farm . knock-off success by the end of this summer , they 'll be able to ogle kamps , along with her sidekick , indira , ex-singer of pop group bro 'sis .
ironically , that band was the product of another german reality show , " popstars , " which , like " the simple life " , was also an imported format that was previously successful in britain and the u.s. the german television landscape is teeming with u.s. and british knock-offs , though rarely , if ever , does it work the other way round .
never mind what this says about the ability of german media executives to come up with their own hit formats - the foreign imports are popular with viewers , and that means big bucks for the broadcasters lucky enough to nab them . quiz shows such as " who wants to be a millionaire , " talent shows such as " star search , " and reality shows such as " the bachelor , " and " big brother " have all been germanized .
even mtv 's catty dating show " dismissed " has got in on the act . dirty and sweaty ? so bring on " the simple life " and judith kamps , who , it seems , has been working on her best paris hilton impression when thinking about what lies in store for her on the farm . " the worst thing would be to have to help out with birthing a calf .
how disgusting ! " she said in an interview with the german tabloid bild am sonntag .
" i 'm scared we 're going to be running around dirty and sweaty all the time . " preparation is everything , and kamps has the advantage of acquainting herself with the original show before her own two-month trial begins .
so unlike hilton , kamps already knows she 's better off leaving her stilettos at home .
she plans on taking rubber boots instead .
designer , with leopard-print , of course . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is german reality tv show ' torture ' ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.04.2004 u.s. decides to fingerprint european travelers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in september , european visitors will be digitally fingerprinted .
visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .
since sept .
11 , inbound overseas travel to the u.s. has declined by 30 percent .
the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia -rrb- does n't want to see those numbers decline further , and issued a statement on friday .
" while we appreciate the rationale for the federal government 's action , tia is nonetheless greatly disappointed and very concerned about potential negative reactions in key inbound tourism markets from western europe , japan and other important visa waiver countries , " said william s. norman , president and ceo of the tia .
indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .
at issue is the extent of the data transfer .
european parliament representatives feel only 19 categories of data should be relayed , instead of the 34 negotiated by the commission .
according to the resolution , " such access is illegal under member state and eu privacy laws . "
both sides will continue to debate the issue this week . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de look me in the eye forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .

indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .

the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia -rrb- does n't want to see those numbers decline further , and issued a statement on friday .
" while we appreciate the rationale for the federal government 's action , tia is nonetheless greatly disappointed and very concerned about potential negative reactions in key inbound tourism markets from western europe , japan and other important visa waiver countries , " said william s. norman , president and ceo of the tia .
indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.04.2004 u.s. decides to fingerprint european travelers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in september , european visitors will be digitally fingerprinted .
visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .
since sept .
11 , inbound overseas travel to the u.s. has declined by 30 percent .
the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia -rrb- does n't want to see those numbers decline further , and issued a statement on friday .
" while we appreciate the rationale for the federal government 's action , tia is nonetheless greatly disappointed and very concerned about potential negative reactions in key inbound tourism markets from western europe , japan and other important visa waiver countries , " said william s. norman , president and ceo of the tia .
indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .
at issue is the extent of the data transfer .
european parliament representatives feel only 19 categories of data should be relayed , instead of the 34 negotiated by the commission .
according to the resolution , " such access is illegal under member state and eu privacy laws . "
both sides will continue to debate the issue this week . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de look me in the eye forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .

austrian environmentalists are in the middle of a three-day blockade of key motorways .
they 're protesting against increased truck traffic they say is polluting the alpine countryside . environmental activists continued their protest action on tuesday against what they call austria 's " traffic avalanche , " blocking several highways for up to five hours at a time .
they plan to expand the action on wednesday , blocking motorways in the austrian provinces of tyrol , salzburg , carinthia and lower austria for 12 hours . turnout so far has been low but good-natured , with families taking advantage of the blockade to ride their bicycles along roads normally choked with heavy transport trucks .
in lower austria , groups of protesters picknicked while listening to live music , including the song " highway to hell . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party atmosphere prevails at sites where blockades have been mounted . traffic is being diverted along alternate routes , and so far , austrian police say they 've managed to avoid large traffic jams . politicians sympathetic austrian politicians have expressed understanding for the three-day blockade .
the country 's transport minister , hubert gorbach , said the protests are sending an important signal to the eu in brussels " the people who live here and who are plagued by the traffic have made the problem visible to the eu , " he said . but the protest action also met with criticism because of its timing .
the week leading up to easter typically means extra traffic on the roads as people go on holiday .
the head of the economic association of tyrol , jürgen bodenseer , said the blockades were only damaging tyrol 's tourism industry . major transit zone austria is a major transit zone with four mountain passes linking northern and southern europe .
in addition to the millions of cars , approximately 1.8 million transport trucks roll across its transit motorways each year .
the pollution emissions along these routes that cut through the country 's beautiful alpine landscape regularly exceed the permissible level . the transit routes are likely to become even more important when the eu expands to include eastern neighbors czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia next month .
experts warn that the amount of traffic on austrian motorways could double in the next year . austria is dissatisfied with a compromise ruling adopted by eu ministers in brussels last year that reduces the restrictions on heavy goods traffic that austria had negotiated when it joined the eu in 1995 .
to encourage the use of more environmentally-friendly vehicles , the eu granted cleaner trucks unrestricted access .
austria says the compromise allows 80 percent of vehicles in transit to cross through the country freely without being subject to any quotas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de successful road toll models in europe after months of delays , the german toll collect experiment is now on hold and the contract with its proposed operator in tatters .

just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .
wippit recently started offering downloads for a mere € .39 per song and has plans to launch in germany soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .
wippit recently started offering downloads for a mere € .39 per song and has plans to launch in germany soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .

mobile chemical labs allegedly found in iraq were one of the reasons u.s. officials used to justify the war .
german intelligence agents supplied the information , but the labs likely never existed . few sessions of the un security council got as much attention as the one on feb .
5 , 2003 .
using audio tapes , slides and a powerpoint presentation , u.s. secretary of state colin powell presented " solid proof " for iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's weapons arsenal . mobile labs were especially dangerous , powell said , adding that iraqis had supposedly set up such factories on 18 trucks , enabling them to produce chemical and biological weapons at all times .
america 's chief diplomat presented detailed photos and drawings as further proof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell at a un security council session " these are no allegations , " he said .
" what we are telling you is based on facts and conclusions drawn from solid intelligence reports . " fourteen months later , things sound a little different .
" now it appears not to be the case that it was that solid , " powell said last week , adding that he had checked and verified different sources of information as the content of the reports appeared " dramatic . " but u.s. intelligence officials now believe the information was fictitious .
even republican members of congress have expressed their outrage . " this is embarrassing for everybody who relied on this information , " pat roberts , chairman of the u.s. senate intelligence committee , told the los angeles times . germans supplied information the information 's main source seems to have been germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
the organization 's informant , a young iraqi man whose codename is " curveball , " apparently was not a reliable source . curveball came to germany in 1988 and claimed to have been chosen by hussein 's regime to help develop mobile labs after studying chemistry .
he shared details of the program with intelligence agents and offered drawings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad chalabi according to news reports , his stories were fabricated : curveball allegedly is the brother of a senior aide to ahmad chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- , a member of the iraqi interim governing council , who was set on cooperating with the u.s. to bring about a regime change in his country . who 's to blame ?
other sources cited by powell have also proven to be unfounded .
two witnesses merely had heard about , but never actually seen , the labs , david kay , the former u.s. chief weapons inspector , told the los angeles times . however , it remains unclear how the information made its way to washington .
" either the bnd did a bad job or the government passed on the information in a way that was irresponsible , " friedbert pflüger , a german parliamentarian and foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democrats , told der spiegel newsmagazine . markus wendler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one year later , germany anything but smug over iraq war germany 's steadfast opposition to the iraq war led to a division within europe and a new ice age with the bush administration in washington .

mobile chemical labs allegedly found in iraq were one of the reasons u.s. officials used to justify the war .
german intelligence agents supplied the information , but the labs likely never existed . few sessions of the un security council got as much attention as the one on feb .
5 , 2003 .
using audio tapes , slides and a powerpoint presentation , u.s. secretary of state colin powell presented " solid proof " for iraqi dictator saddam hussein 's weapons arsenal . mobile labs were especially dangerous , powell said , adding that iraqis had supposedly set up such factories on 18 trucks , enabling them to produce chemical and biological weapons at all times .
america 's chief diplomat presented detailed photos and drawings as further proof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : powell at a un security council session " these are no allegations , " he said .
" what we are telling you is based on facts and conclusions drawn from solid intelligence reports . " fourteen months later , things sound a little different .
" now it appears not to be the case that it was that solid , " powell said last week , adding that he had checked and verified different sources of information as the content of the reports appeared " dramatic . " but u.s. intelligence officials now believe the information was fictitious .
even republican members of congress have expressed their outrage . " this is embarrassing for everybody who relied on this information , " pat roberts , chairman of the u.s. senate intelligence committee , told the los angeles times . germans supplied information the information 's main source seems to have been germany 's foreign intelligence service , the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
the organization 's informant , a young iraqi man whose codename is " curveball , " apparently was not a reliable source . curveball came to germany in 1988 and claimed to have been chosen by hussein 's regime to help develop mobile labs after studying chemistry .
he shared details of the program with intelligence agents and offered drawings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmad chalabi according to news reports , his stories were fabricated : curveball allegedly is the brother of a senior aide to ahmad chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- , a member of the iraqi interim governing council , who was set on cooperating with the u.s. to bring about a regime change in his country . who 's to blame ?
other sources cited by powell have also proven to be unfounded .
two witnesses merely had heard about , but never actually seen , the labs , david kay , the former u.s. chief weapons inspector , told the los angeles times . however , it remains unclear how the information made its way to washington .

the mass circulation daily wrote on tuesday that british prime minister tony blair is prepared to hold a referendum on whether or not the uk should stay in the european union .
he could effectively turn the next general election in 2006 into a single-issue poll on britain 's relationship with europe , the paper says .
if blair were to win such an all-encompassing poll , it could then give him the authority to agree to the proposed eu constitution and bring britain into the euro zone .
the timing and the exact wording of such a referendum question have yet to be decided .
but the widely read sun has often been used by blair to float controversial ideas in the past .
according to wire reports , the government denied the claims last night , saying that their position on a referendum on europe remained " consistent . "
blair has repeatedly rejected calls for a referendum on the constitution and says that there will be a referendum on joining the euro only when the economic situation is right for the uk .
such a " do or die " vote would represent a risky but potentially clever strategy for blair , who is coming under increasing pressure to define once and for all britain 's relationship with the eu .
the majority of people in the uk are against adopting the euro but want to remain in the eu and want a referendum on the constitution .
by combining all the issues , blair would force voters into choosing " all-in " or " all-out . "
the strategy would also outflank the resurgent opposition conservative party , who would be forced to campaign for withdrawal from the eu - an unpopular choice .
the tories tried to fight the last general election on european issues but their " save the pound " campaign proved disastrous and they were thrashed at the ballot box .
if blair ends up victorious in such a poll , it would serve to reinvigorate his administration , which has been under siege recently , with rows over immigration and iraq .
-lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- dw-world.de britain says no to euro for now britain ’ s government announced on monday that the time is not yet right to switch from the pound to the euro .

the mass circulation daily wrote on tuesday that british prime minister tony blair is prepared to hold a referendum on whether or not the uk should stay in the european union .
he could effectively turn the next general election in 2006 into a single-issue poll on britain 's relationship with europe , the paper says .
if blair were to win such an all-encompassing poll , it could then give him the authority to agree to the proposed eu constitution and bring britain into the euro zone .
the timing and the exact wording of such a referendum question have yet to be decided .
but the widely read sun has often been used by blair to float controversial ideas in the past .
according to wire reports , the government denied the claims last night , saying that their position on a referendum on europe remained " consistent . "
blair has repeatedly rejected calls for a referendum on the constitution and says that there will be a referendum on joining the euro only when the economic situation is right for the uk .
such a " do or die " vote would represent a risky but potentially clever strategy for blair , who is coming under increasing pressure to define once and for all britain 's relationship with the eu .
the majority of people in the uk are against adopting the euro but want to remain in the eu and want a referendum on the constitution .
by combining all the issues , blair would force voters into choosing " all-in " or " all-out . "
the strategy would also outflank the resurgent opposition conservative party , who would be forced to campaign for withdrawal from the eu - an unpopular choice .
the tories tried to fight the last general election on european issues but their " save the pound " campaign proved disastrous and they were thrashed at the ballot box .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.04.2004 kraut goes classy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly haute cuisine it 's long had a bad rap as a sidekick to greasy sausages or significant chunks of a pig 's leg , but sauerkraut is not just a boring accompaniment to the heavier types of german food , as aficionados are trying to prove . the kraut itself , of course , is actually quite healthy , as producers of the delicacy will gladly point out .
it contains few calories and a lot of vitamin c and is even supposed to aid digestion as the " intestine 's broom . "
too few people seem to accept this , however , and 40 sauerkraut connoisseurs from germany , france , the netherlands and italy recently met to come up with ways to change that .
meeting in marlenheim , just east of strasbourg in the alsace region of france , chefs and kraut makers exchanged ideas to lift pickled cabbage to new heights as a peppermint sauerkraut sorbet or a basis for sushi .
it 's a difficult undertaking , according to eckart hengstenberg , a member of one of germany 's leading sauerkraut dynasties and president of the european association of sauerkraut producers .
" it 's just not that easy to change eating habits , " he told afp news wire .
hengstenberg and his colleagues have every reason to push kraut as a tasty delicacy .
the average frenchman for example only eats about 800 grams -lrb- 28.2 oz . -rrb- per year - one fifth less than a decade ago .
germans , on the other hand , have remained faithful to their alleged national side dish -lrb- which was actually imported from china -rrb- : they 're still eating about 3.2 kg -lrb- 112.8 oz . -rrb- a year .
come may , the eu 's new eastern european member states might help to boost kraut business again .
but a touch of haute cuisine seems unnecessary there : poles , czechs and slovaks do n't seem to have a problem with enjoying their cabbage with a deliciously greasy fried sausage .

it contains few calories and a lot of vitamin c and is even supposed to aid digestion as the " intestine 's broom . "
too few people seem to accept this , however , and 40 sauerkraut connoisseurs from germany , france , the netherlands and italy recently met to come up with ways to change that .
meeting in marlenheim , just east of strasbourg in the alsace region of france , chefs and kraut makers exchanged ideas to lift pickled cabbage to new heights as a peppermint sauerkraut sorbet or a basis for sushi .
it 's a difficult undertaking , according to eckart hengstenberg , a member of one of germany 's leading sauerkraut dynasties and president of the european association of sauerkraut producers .
" it 's just not that easy to change eating habits , " he told afp news wire .
hengstenberg and his colleagues have every reason to push kraut as a tasty delicacy .
the average frenchman for example only eats about 800 grams -lrb- 28.2 oz . -rrb- per year - one fifth less than a decade ago .
germans , on the other hand , have remained faithful to their alleged national side dish -lrb- which was actually imported from china -rrb- : they 're still eating about 3.2 kg -lrb- 112.8 oz . -rrb- a year .
come may , the eu 's new eastern european member states might help to boost kraut business again .
but a touch of haute cuisine seems unnecessary there : poles , czechs and slovaks do n't seem to have a problem with enjoying their cabbage with a deliciously greasy fried sausage .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs . " rebuilding the east is responsible for at least two thirds of germany 's weak growth .

instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .
" we have to readjust things anew , " he told german radio station mdr info . conservative eastern officials including saxony 's premier georg milbradt have called for radically restructuring the region to make it more attractive to businesses .
however , plans to make the eastern states a " special economic zone " have not been greeted by all politicians with such enthusiasm . " that is a completely unrealistic perspective that we should quickly bury , " said leader of the greens reinhard bütikofer , according to the associated press .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs .

instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .

it contains few calories and a lot of vitamin c and is even supposed to aid digestion as the " intestine 's broom . "
too few people seem to accept this , however , and 40 sauerkraut connoisseurs from germany , france , the netherlands and italy recently met to come up with ways to change that .
meeting in marlenheim , just east of strasbourg in the alsace region of france , chefs and kraut makers exchanged ideas to lift pickled cabbage to new heights as a peppermint sauerkraut sorbet or a basis for sushi .
it 's a difficult undertaking , according to eckart hengstenberg , a member of one of germany 's leading sauerkraut dynasties and president of the european association of sauerkraut producers .
" it 's just not that easy to change eating habits , " he told afp news wire .
hengstenberg and his colleagues have every reason to push kraut as a tasty delicacy .
the average frenchman for example only eats about 800 grams -lrb- 28.2 oz . -rrb- per year - one fifth less than a decade ago .
germans , on the other hand , have remained faithful to their alleged national side dish -lrb- which was actually imported from china -rrb- : they 're still eating about 3.2 kg -lrb- 112.8 oz . -rrb- a year .
come may , the eu 's new eastern european member states might help to boost kraut business again .
but a touch of haute cuisine seems unnecessary there : poles , czechs and slovaks do n't seem to have a problem with enjoying their cabbage with a deliciously greasy fried sausage .

visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .

indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .

the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.04.2004 u.s. decides to fingerprint european travelers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in september , european visitors will be digitally fingerprinted .
visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .
since sept .
11 , inbound overseas travel to the u.s. has declined by 30 percent .
the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia -rrb- does n't want to see those numbers decline further , and issued a statement on friday .
" while we appreciate the rationale for the federal government 's action , tia is nonetheless greatly disappointed and very concerned about potential negative reactions in key inbound tourism markets from western europe , japan and other important visa waiver countries , " said william s. norman , president and ceo of the tia .
indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .
at issue is the extent of the data transfer .
european parliament representatives feel only 19 categories of data should be relayed , instead of the 34 negotiated by the commission .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs . " rebuilding the east is responsible for at least two thirds of germany 's weak growth .
as it stands now , germany can not revive itself , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the study , chronically high unemployment near 20 percent in the eastern states has led to mass migration of the young and educated , which is exacerbating the region 's problems . commissioned by the economy ministry and the transport ministry , which is responsible for eastern reconstruction plans , the report calls for a dramatic restructuring of how aid is allotted in the region .
instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .
" we have to readjust things anew , " he told german radio station mdr info . conservative eastern officials including saxony 's premier georg milbradt have called for radically restructuring the region to make it more attractive to businesses .
however , plans to make the eastern states a " special economic zone " have not been greeted by all politicians with such enthusiasm . " that is a completely unrealistic perspective that we should quickly bury , " said leader of the greens reinhard bütikofer , according to the associated press .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2004 german online music platform 's troubled first weeks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phonoline is facing stiff competition .
just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .

just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .

the 18-year-old student had demanded a minimum of € 1,700 each month to fund the lifestyle she felt was entitled to , which included two vacations per year , a computer and a car worth € 7,000 .
support levels for dependents in germany are set by the so-called " düsseldorfer table , " and her father , who has a monthly income of € 15,000 , had been paying her € 865 prior to her becoming a legal adult at 18 .
the presiding judges at the nuremberg court rejected her claim on the grounds her expectations were excessive and would only encourage her to try and support herself . more briefs 06.04.2004 -pipe- genetically modified wheat planted in germany 06.04.2004 -pipe- criminal police chief wants more say in anti-terror fight 05.04.2004 -pipe- college refuses admission to former sept .

the u.s. reality soap " the simple life " starring heiress paris hilton is a big hit on german tv .
but the import is n't enough , and germany is getting its own version - complete with blonde glamour girl . germany 's answer to paris hilton might not be as famous as the american hotel heiress who 's made a career out of flaunting her extravagant lifestyle , but judith kamps , the daughter of millionaire bakery king heiner kamps , is prepared to give hilton a run for her money . " we 're both blonde , spoiled , and like to shop , " she says .
for her , that 's where the similarities end : " paris is an airhead , whereas i 'm studying fashion design at a private college in düsseldorf . " well , there is one more similarity .
following in hilton 's footsteps , kamps is about to trade in her gucci shoes for a pair of galoshes and get down home on the farm for the german version of " the simple life . " german broadcaster rtl is planning its own take on the u.s. series , which became an immediate hit when it started airing here last month on rtl 's competitor , prosieben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris hilton and nicole richie german audiences ca n't seem to get enough of paris hilton and gal pal nicole richie -lrb- daughter of singer lionel richie -rrb- as they struggle to survive everyday life on an arkansas farm . knock-off success by the end of this summer , they 'll be able to ogle kamps , along with her sidekick , indira , ex-singer of pop group bro 'sis .

never mind what this says about the ability of german media executives to come up with their own hit formats - the foreign imports are popular with viewers , and that means big bucks for the broadcasters lucky enough to nab them . quiz shows such as " who wants to be a millionaire , " talent shows such as " star search , " and reality shows such as " the bachelor , " and " big brother " have all been germanized .

" the worst thing would be to have to help out with birthing a calf .
how disgusting ! " she said in an interview with the german tabloid bild am sonntag .
" i 'm scared we 're going to be running around dirty and sweaty all the time . " preparation is everything , and kamps has the advantage of acquainting herself with the original show before her own two-month trial begins .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.04.2004 u.s. decides to fingerprint european travelers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in september , european visitors will be digitally fingerprinted .
visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .
since sept .
11 , inbound overseas travel to the u.s. has declined by 30 percent .
the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia -rrb- does n't want to see those numbers decline further , and issued a statement on friday .
" while we appreciate the rationale for the federal government 's action , tia is nonetheless greatly disappointed and very concerned about potential negative reactions in key inbound tourism markets from western europe , japan and other important visa waiver countries , " said william s. norman , president and ceo of the tia .
indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .
at issue is the extent of the data transfer .
european parliament representatives feel only 19 categories of data should be relayed , instead of the 34 negotiated by the commission .
according to the resolution , " such access is illegal under member state and eu privacy laws . "
both sides will continue to debate the issue this week . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de look me in the eye forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.04.2004 germany seeking the simple life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bakery heiress judith kamps is germany 's paris hilton .
the u.s. reality soap " the simple life " starring heiress paris hilton is a big hit on german tv .
but the import is n't enough , and germany is getting its own version - complete with blonde glamour girl . germany 's answer to paris hilton might not be as famous as the american hotel heiress who 's made a career out of flaunting her extravagant lifestyle , but judith kamps , the daughter of millionaire bakery king heiner kamps , is prepared to give hilton a run for her money . " we 're both blonde , spoiled , and like to shop , " she says .
for her , that 's where the similarities end : " paris is an airhead , whereas i 'm studying fashion design at a private college in düsseldorf . " well , there is one more similarity .
following in hilton 's footsteps , kamps is about to trade in her gucci shoes for a pair of galoshes and get down home on the farm for the german version of " the simple life . " german broadcaster rtl is planning its own take on the u.s. series , which became an immediate hit when it started airing here last month on rtl 's competitor , prosieben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris hilton and nicole richie german audiences ca n't seem to get enough of paris hilton and gal pal nicole richie -lrb- daughter of singer lionel richie -rrb- as they struggle to survive everyday life on an arkansas farm . knock-off success by the end of this summer , they 'll be able to ogle kamps , along with her sidekick , indira , ex-singer of pop group bro 'sis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.04.2004 germany seeking the simple life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bakery heiress judith kamps is germany 's paris hilton .
the u.s. reality soap " the simple life " starring heiress paris hilton is a big hit on german tv .
but the import is n't enough , and germany is getting its own version - complete with blonde glamour girl . germany 's answer to paris hilton might not be as famous as the american hotel heiress who 's made a career out of flaunting her extravagant lifestyle , but judith kamps , the daughter of millionaire bakery king heiner kamps , is prepared to give hilton a run for her money . " we 're both blonde , spoiled , and like to shop , " she says .
for her , that 's where the similarities end : " paris is an airhead , whereas i 'm studying fashion design at a private college in düsseldorf . " well , there is one more similarity .
following in hilton 's footsteps , kamps is about to trade in her gucci shoes for a pair of galoshes and get down home on the farm for the german version of " the simple life . " german broadcaster rtl is planning its own take on the u.s. series , which became an immediate hit when it started airing here last month on rtl 's competitor , prosieben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris hilton and nicole richie german audiences ca n't seem to get enough of paris hilton and gal pal nicole richie -lrb- daughter of singer lionel richie -rrb- as they struggle to survive everyday life on an arkansas farm . knock-off success by the end of this summer , they 'll be able to ogle kamps , along with her sidekick , indira , ex-singer of pop group bro 'sis .
ironically , that band was the product of another german reality show , " popstars , " which , like " the simple life " , was also an imported format that was previously successful in britain and the u.s. the german television landscape is teeming with u.s. and british knock-offs , though rarely , if ever , does it work the other way round .
never mind what this says about the ability of german media executives to come up with their own hit formats - the foreign imports are popular with viewers , and that means big bucks for the broadcasters lucky enough to nab them . quiz shows such as " who wants to be a millionaire , " talent shows such as " star search , " and reality shows such as " the bachelor , " and " big brother " have all been germanized .
even mtv 's catty dating show " dismissed " has got in on the act . dirty and sweaty ? so bring on " the simple life " and judith kamps , who , it seems , has been working on her best paris hilton impression when thinking about what lies in store for her on the farm . " the worst thing would be to have to help out with birthing a calf .
how disgusting ! " she said in an interview with the german tabloid bild am sonntag .
" i 'm scared we 're going to be running around dirty and sweaty all the time . " preparation is everything , and kamps has the advantage of acquainting herself with the original show before her own two-month trial begins .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs . " rebuilding the east is responsible for at least two thirds of germany 's weak growth .
as it stands now , germany can not revive itself , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the study , chronically high unemployment near 20 percent in the eastern states has led to mass migration of the young and educated , which is exacerbating the region 's problems . commissioned by the economy ministry and the transport ministry , which is responsible for eastern reconstruction plans , the report calls for a dramatic restructuring of how aid is allotted in the region .
instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .
" we have to readjust things anew , " he told german radio station mdr info . conservative eastern officials including saxony 's premier georg milbradt have called for radically restructuring the region to make it more attractive to businesses .
however , plans to make the eastern states a " special economic zone " have not been greeted by all politicians with such enthusiasm . " that is a completely unrealistic perspective that we should quickly bury , " said leader of the greens reinhard bütikofer , according to the associated press .
bütikofer and others see major legal difficulties in implementing a special zone , since there would be conflicts with both german and eu labor and tax codes . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

it contains few calories and a lot of vitamin c and is even supposed to aid digestion as the " intestine 's broom . "
too few people seem to accept this , however , and 40 sauerkraut connoisseurs from germany , france , the netherlands and italy recently met to come up with ways to change that .
meeting in marlenheim , just east of strasbourg in the alsace region of france , chefs and kraut makers exchanged ideas to lift pickled cabbage to new heights as a peppermint sauerkraut sorbet or a basis for sushi .
it 's a difficult undertaking , according to eckart hengstenberg , a member of one of germany 's leading sauerkraut dynasties and president of the european association of sauerkraut producers .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs . " rebuilding the east is responsible for at least two thirds of germany 's weak growth .
as it stands now , germany can not revive itself , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the study , chronically high unemployment near 20 percent in the eastern states has led to mass migration of the young and educated , which is exacerbating the region 's problems . commissioned by the economy ministry and the transport ministry , which is responsible for eastern reconstruction plans , the report calls for a dramatic restructuring of how aid is allotted in the region .
instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .
" we have to readjust things anew , " he told german radio station mdr info . conservative eastern officials including saxony 's premier georg milbradt have called for radically restructuring the region to make it more attractive to businesses .
however , plans to make the eastern states a " special economic zone " have not been greeted by all politicians with such enthusiasm . " that is a completely unrealistic perspective that we should quickly bury , " said leader of the greens reinhard bütikofer , according to the associated press .
bütikofer and others see major legal difficulties in implementing a special zone , since there would be conflicts with both german and eu labor and tax codes . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

it contains few calories and a lot of vitamin c and is even supposed to aid digestion as the " intestine 's broom . "
too few people seem to accept this , however , and 40 sauerkraut connoisseurs from germany , france , the netherlands and italy recently met to come up with ways to change that .
meeting in marlenheim , just east of strasbourg in the alsace region of france , chefs and kraut makers exchanged ideas to lift pickled cabbage to new heights as a peppermint sauerkraut sorbet or a basis for sushi .
it 's a difficult undertaking , according to eckart hengstenberg , a member of one of germany 's leading sauerkraut dynasties and president of the european association of sauerkraut producers .
" it 's just not that easy to change eating habits , " he told afp news wire .
hengstenberg and his colleagues have every reason to push kraut as a tasty delicacy .
the average frenchman for example only eats about 800 grams -lrb- 28.2 oz . -rrb- per year - one fifth less than a decade ago .
germans , on the other hand , have remained faithful to their alleged national side dish -lrb- which was actually imported from china -rrb- : they 're still eating about 3.2 kg -lrb- 112.8 oz . -rrb- a year .
come may , the eu 's new eastern european member states might help to boost kraut business again .
but a touch of haute cuisine seems unnecessary there : poles , czechs and slovaks do n't seem to have a problem with enjoying their cabbage with a deliciously greasy fried sausage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.04.2004 austrian protesters block alpine traffic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1.8 million trucks cross the alps through austria each year .
austrian environmentalists are in the middle of a three-day blockade of key motorways .
they 're protesting against increased truck traffic they say is polluting the alpine countryside . environmental activists continued their protest action on tuesday against what they call austria 's " traffic avalanche , " blocking several highways for up to five hours at a time .
they plan to expand the action on wednesday , blocking motorways in the austrian provinces of tyrol , salzburg , carinthia and lower austria for 12 hours . turnout so far has been low but good-natured , with families taking advantage of the blockade to ride their bicycles along roads normally choked with heavy transport trucks .
in lower austria , groups of protesters picknicked while listening to live music , including the song " highway to hell . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party atmosphere prevails at sites where blockades have been mounted . traffic is being diverted along alternate routes , and so far , austrian police say they 've managed to avoid large traffic jams . politicians sympathetic austrian politicians have expressed understanding for the three-day blockade .
the country 's transport minister , hubert gorbach , said the protests are sending an important signal to the eu in brussels " the people who live here and who are plagued by the traffic have made the problem visible to the eu , " he said . but the protest action also met with criticism because of its timing .
the week leading up to easter typically means extra traffic on the roads as people go on holiday .
the head of the economic association of tyrol , jürgen bodenseer , said the blockades were only damaging tyrol 's tourism industry . major transit zone austria is a major transit zone with four mountain passes linking northern and southern europe .
in addition to the millions of cars , approximately 1.8 million transport trucks roll across its transit motorways each year .
the pollution emissions along these routes that cut through the country 's beautiful alpine landscape regularly exceed the permissible level . the transit routes are likely to become even more important when the eu expands to include eastern neighbors czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia next month .
experts warn that the amount of traffic on austrian motorways could double in the next year . austria is dissatisfied with a compromise ruling adopted by eu ministers in brussels last year that reduces the restrictions on heavy goods traffic that austria had negotiated when it joined the eu in 1995 .
to encourage the use of more environmentally-friendly vehicles , the eu granted cleaner trucks unrestricted access .
austria says the compromise allows 80 percent of vehicles in transit to cross through the country freely without being subject to any quotas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de successful road toll models in europe after months of delays , the german toll collect experiment is now on hold and the contract with its proposed operator in tatters .

just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .

just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .
wippit recently started offering downloads for a mere € .39 per song and has plans to launch in germany soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.04.2004 u.s. decides to fingerprint european travelers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in september , european visitors will be digitally fingerprinted .
visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .
since sept .
11 , inbound overseas travel to the u.s. has declined by 30 percent .
the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia -rrb- does n't want to see those numbers decline further , and issued a statement on friday .
" while we appreciate the rationale for the federal government 's action , tia is nonetheless greatly disappointed and very concerned about potential negative reactions in key inbound tourism markets from western europe , japan and other important visa waiver countries , " said william s. norman , president and ceo of the tia .
indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .
at issue is the extent of the data transfer .
european parliament representatives feel only 19 categories of data should be relayed , instead of the 34 negotiated by the commission .
according to the resolution , " such access is illegal under member state and eu privacy laws . "
both sides will continue to debate the issue this week . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de look me in the eye forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .

the u.s. reality soap " the simple life " starring heiress paris hilton is a big hit on german tv .
but the import is n't enough , and germany is getting its own version - complete with blonde glamour girl . germany 's answer to paris hilton might not be as famous as the american hotel heiress who 's made a career out of flaunting her extravagant lifestyle , but judith kamps , the daughter of millionaire bakery king heiner kamps , is prepared to give hilton a run for her money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.04.2004 germany seeking the simple life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bakery heiress judith kamps is germany 's paris hilton .
the u.s. reality soap " the simple life " starring heiress paris hilton is a big hit on german tv .
but the import is n't enough , and germany is getting its own version - complete with blonde glamour girl . germany 's answer to paris hilton might not be as famous as the american hotel heiress who 's made a career out of flaunting her extravagant lifestyle , but judith kamps , the daughter of millionaire bakery king heiner kamps , is prepared to give hilton a run for her money . " we 're both blonde , spoiled , and like to shop , " she says .
for her , that 's where the similarities end : " paris is an airhead , whereas i 'm studying fashion design at a private college in düsseldorf . " well , there is one more similarity .
following in hilton 's footsteps , kamps is about to trade in her gucci shoes for a pair of galoshes and get down home on the farm for the german version of " the simple life . " german broadcaster rtl is planning its own take on the u.s. series , which became an immediate hit when it started airing here last month on rtl 's competitor , prosieben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris hilton and nicole richie german audiences ca n't seem to get enough of paris hilton and gal pal nicole richie -lrb- daughter of singer lionel richie -rrb- as they struggle to survive everyday life on an arkansas farm . knock-off success by the end of this summer , they 'll be able to ogle kamps , along with her sidekick , indira , ex-singer of pop group bro 'sis .
ironically , that band was the product of another german reality show , " popstars , " which , like " the simple life " , was also an imported format that was previously successful in britain and the u.s. the german television landscape is teeming with u.s. and british knock-offs , though rarely , if ever , does it work the other way round .
never mind what this says about the ability of german media executives to come up with their own hit formats - the foreign imports are popular with viewers , and that means big bucks for the broadcasters lucky enough to nab them . quiz shows such as " who wants to be a millionaire , " talent shows such as " star search , " and reality shows such as " the bachelor , " and " big brother " have all been germanized .
even mtv 's catty dating show " dismissed " has got in on the act . dirty and sweaty ? so bring on " the simple life " and judith kamps , who , it seems , has been working on her best paris hilton impression when thinking about what lies in store for her on the farm . " the worst thing would be to have to help out with birthing a calf .
how disgusting ! " she said in an interview with the german tabloid bild am sonntag .
" i 'm scared we 're going to be running around dirty and sweaty all the time . " preparation is everything , and kamps has the advantage of acquainting herself with the original show before her own two-month trial begins .
so unlike hilton , kamps already knows she 's better off leaving her stilettos at home .
she plans on taking rubber boots instead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.04.2004 u.s. decides to fingerprint european travelers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in september , european visitors will be digitally fingerprinted .
visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .
since sept .
11 , inbound overseas travel to the u.s. has declined by 30 percent .
the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia -rrb- does n't want to see those numbers decline further , and issued a statement on friday .
" while we appreciate the rationale for the federal government 's action , tia is nonetheless greatly disappointed and very concerned about potential negative reactions in key inbound tourism markets from western europe , japan and other important visa waiver countries , " said william s. norman , president and ceo of the tia .
indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .
at issue is the extent of the data transfer .
european parliament representatives feel only 19 categories of data should be relayed , instead of the 34 negotiated by the commission .
according to the resolution , " such access is illegal under member state and eu privacy laws . "
both sides will continue to debate the issue this week . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de look me in the eye forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .

the 18-year-old student had demanded a minimum of € 1,700 each month to fund the lifestyle she felt was entitled to , which included two vacations per year , a computer and a car worth € 7,000 .
support levels for dependents in germany are set by the so-called " düsseldorfer table , " and her father , who has a monthly income of € 15,000 , had been paying her € 865 prior to her becoming a legal adult at 18 .
the presiding judges at the nuremberg court rejected her claim on the grounds her expectations were excessive and would only encourage her to try and support herself . more briefs 06.04.2004 -pipe- genetically modified wheat planted in germany 06.04.2004 -pipe- criminal police chief wants more say in anti-terror fight 05.04.2004 -pipe- college refuses admission to former sept .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs .

instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .
wippit recently started offering downloads for a mere € .39 per song and has plans to launch in germany soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

eu defense ministers have backed a plan proposed by germany , france and britain to set up mobile " battle groups " capable of moving quickly to hotspots beyond eu borders . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on monday that the eu was in favor of setting up several small and mobile " battle groups " under a u.n. umbrella by 2007 .
the rapid deployment groups could be sent into action whenever and wherever needed . solana was speaking after an informal meeting of eu defense ministers in brussels , which saw widespread acceptance of the peacekeeping plan floated by france , germany and britain . speedy reaction under the plan , a permanent pool of 1,500 rapid-reaction troops , similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping force that intervened in congo last year , would be on call to move worldwide within 15 days to quell a conflict beyond eu boundaries for up to four months before a larger force could arrive .
the troops would be split into nine smaller battle groups . the plan refers specifically to the need for units to be able to deploy quickly to african hotspots and stresses that the groups be able to operate in a variety of hostile terrains , from jungles and deserts to mountains and cities . britain , france and some other large eu countries are expected to provide units on their own , while other smaller countries would combine troops .
the eu plans to have three such units up and running by next year , though it remains unclear whether all nine battle groups will be in place by 2007 . irish defense minister michael smith , who chaired the meeting said , " there was a very , very positive reaction to the proposal . "
he underlined the importance of a quick response from the eu in times of crisis .
" rapid response , being able to engage much earlier , is … essential . " solana , however , said the eu also needed to speed up its political response to crises .
" we have to have a rapid system of decision-making and rapid planning , " he told a news conference after the meeting . closer defense ties between eu 's " big three " the battle group plan signals closer defense cooperation between germany , france and britain after a period of strained relations over the iraq war when britain backed the u.s.-led invasion . ties between the three further worsened when paris and berlin pushed plans for a separate eu military headquarters , a move that london and washington interpreted as a threat to nato . however , britain has since softened its position and in a compromise reached last year , the eu 's " big three " agreed to set up a smaller planning cell , which they insist will be used to coordinate eu military missions , without undermining nato 's role . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diplomats see no european threat to nato confusion over plans by great britain , france and germany to set up an eu defense planning structure independent of nato has drawn strong criticism from a top u.s. diplomat , who called an emergency meeting monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2004 german online music platform 's troubled first weeks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phonoline is facing stiff competition .
just weeks after its launch , phonoline , germany 's first online music platform , is the object of much criticism .
soon the fledgling company will face heavy competition from oversees - can it survive ? the launch of phonoline , germany 's online music platform , was a fiasco - even embarrassing chancellor gerhard schröder .
three weeks later , critics are still on the attack , claiming the selection is too limited and the price of downloading individual songs too high .
with more competition coming from overseas in the form of a soon-to-be launched european version of apple 's itunes and others , phonoline will have to fight to survive .
an inauspicious beginning three weeks ago at the annual cebit technology show in hannover , phonoline was set to debut with much fanfare .
in a special ceremony , chancellor schröder , who in the midst of his " innovation offensive " is eager to align himself with all things high-tech , was supposed to download the first song .
but before the chancellor could download belgian singer songwriter kate ryan 's " only if i , " the german copyright society -lrb- gema -rrb- put a damper on the festivities .
in an open letter , the society suggested that the chancellor would be engaging in an illegal activity because , " the required copyright licence for this download at cebit had not yet been obtained by any party " .
the flap exposed the ongoing battle between gema and phonoline , who have been engaged in negotiations for months to determine under what circumstances music can be downloaded legally , from whom the necessary rights must be obtained , and at what cost .
this begged the question : is this version of " legal " downloading really legal ?
instead of displaying his technological savvy and downloading the song himself , the chancellor stood by and watched as someone else did the dirty work .
what was supposed to have been a public relations coup became a fiasco .
but that was just the beginning .
three weeks after the launch , phonoline is still facing harsh criticism .
limited selection and high prices at the launch , gerd gebhardt , the head of phonoline , promised consumers " a comprehensive catalogue of some 250,000 songs with the daily addition of chart-toppers " .
but that has not proven to be the case .
users have not failed to notice that the platform lacks hits from music icons , like the beatles , madonna and robbie williams .
ditto for german stars herbert grönemeyer and sarah connor .
" comprehensive " it 's not , they say .
what 's more , the cost of downloading individual songs is comparatively expensive at € 1.19 to € 1.99 .
and the songs are encoded , limiting the number of copies that can be made to between three and five depending on which online music store customers use to access the online database .
popfiles and eventim are the two main distributors .
phonoline was meant to be part of a two-pronged assault to reduce music piracy .
in addition to proceeding with legal action against those who illegally use peer-to-peer file sharing software like kazaa , phonoline was supposed to offer music fans a viable -lrb- and legal -rrb- alternative .
but given the limited selection and cost , the latter part of the plan may not work .
more competition from overseas phonoline will not only struggle to triumph over peer-to-peer file sharing sights like kazaa , it will also soon face increased competition from other legal online music platforms planning to launch in europe this year .
apple 's itunes , considered the industry leader , is expected to launch in europe early this year .
should the apple execs choose to maintain the current u.s. asking price of $ .99 -lrb- € .82 -rrb- per song , they will undercut the phonoline price .
apple may also offer users a better deal by not limiting the number of copies that can be made .
also jumping into the ring is the british online music company wippit , which is threatening to start a price war that will challenge both phonoline and itunes .
wippit recently started offering downloads for a mere € .39 per song and has plans to launch in germany soon . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuits loom for european internet pirates the german record industry has launched its first lawsuits in the battle against internet piracy .

visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent . tourists from 22 european countries have long travelled to the united states relatively hassle-free and without a visa .
but as of september 30 , they - along with visitors from five other countries - will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed , according to a recent announcement by the united states ' department of homeland security .
the decision extends the use of the practice already applied to visitors from countries requiring a visa to those travelling from so-called " visa waiver " countries .
it is largely seen as a compromise solution at a time when europe and the u.s. ca n't see eye-to-eye on biometric requirements .
washington officials have been demanding that countries , including germany , france and great britain , issue new passports with biometric details by october 26 .
but when those countries complained that it was impossible to meet the request in such a short period of time , a two-year extension was granted .
the u.s. nonetheless decided to proceed with the fingerprinting and photographing to close that loophole .
a spokesman for the department of homeland security says both will take seconds , but travel industry experts worry they will act as a deterrent , further driving down the already slumping u.s. tourism market .
meanwhile , the european parliament and the european commission are still locked in a battle over whether or not to cede to another u.s. security demand and hand over airline passenger data .
travel experts concerned in theory , the fingerprints and photographs will only take seconds , according to asa hutchinson , an undersecretary of the department of homeland security , who says the move will not deter visitors .
but in an ever-more insecure world where the time required by added security seems to increase delays , it 's hard to say what kind of affect the practice will have on an already declining market .
since sept .
11 , inbound overseas travel to the u.s. has declined by 30 percent .
the travel industry association of america -lrb- tia -rrb- does n't want to see those numbers decline further , and issued a statement on friday .
" while we appreciate the rationale for the federal government 's action , tia is nonetheless greatly disappointed and very concerned about potential negative reactions in key inbound tourism markets from western europe , japan and other important visa waiver countries , " said william s. norman , president and ceo of the tia .
indeed , visitors from those countries account for a significant part of the u.s. travel market : in 2002 , almost 13 million of the 19 million overseas visitors came from the 27 countries affected by the new security decision .
still haggling over airline passenger data on the whole , however , european government officials have accepted the u.s. decision , while other countries , including brazil and china , have publicly protested and warned of reprisals .
" uk passengers will understand why the u.s. has introduced these safety measures , " said a statement issued by the uk foreign office .
meanwhile , some eu officials have proven far less understanding of another u.s. security demand to turn over extensive airline passenger data .
members of the european parliament have threatened to take the european commission to the eu 's highest court if it does n't withdraw a decision to transfer air passenger data to u.s. authorities .
the parliament issued a non-binding resolution on thursday , calling on the commission to negotiate with washington for a better deal .
at issue is the extent of the data transfer .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report . a panel of 13 experts headed by former hamburg mayor klaus von dohnanyi charged with examining the reconstruction of germany 's eastern states has concluded the estimated € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.54 trillion -rrb- in aid has done little to help the economically depressed region . perhaps even more worrying , the experts fear the € 90 billion spent by the government each year is slowly destroying the economy of western germany , as growth stagnates and the eastern states fail to revive 14 years after german reunification . " if things are allowed to continue as they are , all of germany will be dragged down , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung newspaper on tuesday . breaking a public taboo , the report is the first official study to be so openly critical of the government 's reconstruction plan for the formerly-communist east ever since german reunification in 1990 .
it attacks the policies of both the current administration of german chancellor gerhard schröder and his predecessor helmut kohl , who oversaw the unification of east and west . in an interview with dw-radio , dohnanyi said it was clear mistakes were being made from the beginning of the reunification process , but that it was politically difficult to challenge the government 's course of action at the time .
many economists agree with that sentiment . " one of the main criticisms has been that wages rose much too quickly after reunification , " heinz schmalholz , an economist at the ifo economic institute 's dresden office , told the reuters news agency .
" but what would people then have done without that ?
they would of course have migrated to the west where there were higher wages .
i do n't know whether the politicians would have wanted to take responsibility for that . " eu enlargement feared the dohnanyi report comes as germany tries to recover from a recession and many in the country worry eastern european countries set to join the european union in may will compete for investment and jobs with low wage and production costs . " rebuilding the east is responsible for at least two thirds of germany 's weak growth .
as it stands now , germany can not revive itself , " von dohnanyi told the berliner zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the study , chronically high unemployment near 20 percent in the eastern states has led to mass migration of the young and educated , which is exacerbating the region 's problems . commissioned by the economy ministry and the transport ministry , which is responsible for eastern reconstruction plans , the report calls for a dramatic restructuring of how aid is allotted in the region .
instead of continuing to distribute subsidies indiscriminately , it suggests concentrating aid on core growth areas .
welfare benefits could be rebundled as wage supplements instead of as entitlements and companies could be given tax breaks to encourage investment . funding running out transportation minister manfred stolpe on monday admitted there needed to be changes in the way eastern aid was organized , since much funding would run out completely around 2019 .
" we have to readjust things anew , " he told german radio station mdr info . conservative eastern officials including saxony 's premier georg milbradt have called for radically restructuring the region to make it more attractive to businesses .
however , plans to make the eastern states a " special economic zone " have not been greeted by all politicians with such enthusiasm . " that is a completely unrealistic perspective that we should quickly bury , " said leader of the greens reinhard bütikofer , according to the associated press .
bütikofer and others see major legal difficulties in implementing a special zone , since there would be conflicts with both german and eu labor and tax codes . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

more than 1,000 villagers in cottenham , cambridgeshire , are threatening not to pay their council tax if the size of the site is not curtailed .
spokesman terry brownbill said they wanted deputy prime minister john prescott to see their problems .
villagers aim to co-ordinate a national council tax protest to make the government listen to their concerns .
they say their problems are mirrored in at least five other areas of britain and could arise anywhere .
website plan " we know of at least five others areas in britain where they have similar problems - billericay in essex , runnymede in surrey - ironically where the magna carta was signed , a place in north london , northampton , and a place in the lake district , " mr brownbill said .
they plan to set up a website which other people faced with similar problems could access and then try to co-ordinate a national council tax protest .
a travellers ' site has existed near cottenham for 40 years , housing about 30 families .
villagers say over the past year scores more travellers have arrived and set up camp illegally .
many are challenging local council planning orders telling them to leave .
they say the influx head meant growing problems of anti-social behaviour .
" what we want is for the size of travellers ' camps to be limited to 10 , 15 , at an absolute maximum 20 sites , " said mr brownbill .
" that is something that a lot of travellers and the gypsy council would agree with .
we already have 38 sites .
there are 18 appeals against planning refusal .
" if that succeeds , we would have 55 sites .
when you bear in mind that there are four families to a site that adds up to over 1,000 people .
" and there are plans to expand the site into other fields .
we could end up with more than 5,000 people there . "

more than 1,000 villagers in cottenham , cambridgeshire , are threatening not to pay their council tax if the size of the site is not curtailed .
spokesman terry brownbill said they wanted deputy prime minister john prescott to see their problems .
villagers aim to co-ordinate a national council tax protest to make the government listen to their concerns .
they say their problems are mirrored in at least five other areas of britain and could arise anywhere .
website plan " we know of at least five others areas in britain where they have similar problems - billericay in essex , runnymede in surrey - ironically where the magna carta was signed , a place in north london , northampton , and a place in the lake district , " mr brownbill said .
they plan to set up a website which other people faced with similar problems could access and then try to co-ordinate a national council tax protest .
a travellers ' site has existed near cottenham for 40 years , housing about 30 families .
villagers say they could end up with more than 5,000 people villagers say over the past year scores more travellers have arrived and set up camp illegally .
many are challenging local council planning orders telling them to leave .
they say the influx head meant growing problems of anti-social behaviour .
" what we want is for the size of travellers ' camps to be limited to 10 , 15 , at an absolute maximum 20 sites , " said mr brownbill .
" that is something that a lot of travellers and the gypsy council would agree with .
we already have 38 sites .
there are 18 appeals against planning refusal .
" if that succeeds , we would have 55 sites .
when you bear in mind that there are four families to a site that adds up to over 1,000 people .

more than 1,000 villagers in cottenham , cambridgeshire , are threatening not to pay their council tax if the size of the site is not curtailed .
spokesman terry brownbill said they wanted deputy prime minister john prescott to see their problems .

the move comes amid a government crackdown on internet casinos .
federal authorities are using 1961 legislation designed to counter phone-based horserace betting in an attempt to staunch the massive trade .
adverts for the casinos , most of which are outside the us and therefore pose an enforcement problem , " aid and abet " the business , the us says .
yahoo 's decision will mean microsoft 's msn service is also free from online casino advertising , since it outsources ad sales to a yahoo subsidiary , overture .
yahoo will still carry the ads on its sites in 14 countries outside the us .
but google says it will be dropping the adverts altogether .
trade troubles analysts say the desire to crack down on online gambling stems from a wish to control a trade which us regulators say can be used for money laundering and fraud - as well as a temptation for under-age gamblers to run up debts on parents ' credit cards .
a much more recent law than the 1961 wire communications act seeks to make it illegal to pay for internet bets using a credit card .
the crackdown has already led the us into a world trade organisation row with the caribbean state of antigua and barbuda .
about 3,000 of the twin island state 's 60,000 people work in the industry , and its government says the us ban is a restraint on trade and is designed solely to protect the us 's own huge gambling business .

the struggling south pacific nation has endured years of bloodshed , corruption and economic decline .
but for the past four years , the people 's first network has tried to mend fences by using high frequency radio to send and receive e-mail .
the project was recently a finalist for a unesco rural communications prize .
building bridges the solomon islands consists of some 850 islands , mostly undeveloped , spread out over a wide area of the pacific .
the two main ways of getting in touch with people are short-wave radios or satellite telephones .
but radio offers no privacy , whereas satellite phones are too expensive for most to use regularly .
the peoplefirst network stepped into this gap in 2001 .
it was set up with funding from the united nations development programme as a way of connecting the remote island to the outside world , as well as each other .
but another aim was to help overcome the legacy of fear and mistrust created by years of fighting between rival ethnic gangs from malaita and guadalcanal .
" we thought that by connecting people together , they would know more about each other and bring peace to the country , " said joe rausi of the peoplefirst network .
" by installing e-mail , people are able to interact more with each other , talk about the things that they need and discuss issues by e-mail , " he told bbc news online .
send and receive at the moment that are 14 e-mail stations in schools or clinics in rural areas .
the stations are owned by the community , with decisions taken by a committee of village chiefs and religious leaders . "
" we are using old technology but it is robust .
this laptop is quite old but it does the work .
in the end we have to look at what is affordable in villages " joe rausi , peoplefirst network the stations are a pretty basic affair , consisting of an ageing laptop , radio and modem .
the kit is powered by a car battery , which itself runs off a solar panel as in most areas there is no electricity .
the total cost of the equipment runs to around $ 8,000 .
at the heart of the operation is an internet cafe in the capital , honiara , which connects to the internet via satellite .
several times a day , each e-mail station will connect to the hub in honiara and transfer any messages .
the connection speed is around 2kbps , meaning a typical text e-mail sent by rural villagers takes about 10 seconds to transmit .
in february , more than 700 messages were sent over the network and almost 900 received .
most of the mail was between family members in the solomon islands , with just 20 % going overseas .
the system runs on software called wavemail , which works with the hf radios in villages .
" we are using old technology but it is robust , " said mr rausi .
" this laptop is quite old but it does the work .
in the end we have to look at what is affordable in villages . "
" the people first network is not about the technology .
it is about improving the standard of living of people in rural areas .
" the social side is more important than the technology . "
bandwidth issues as for the future , the project is looking to move beyond e-mail and explore using the system for distance-learning and e-commerce .
the big hurdle here is bandwidth .
but the people first network is working with the massachusetts institute of technology on using their tek project .
researchers at the boston institute are developing a search engine designed for people with a slow net connection . " if you are living in a rural village and you want information , you would send a message to tek , " explained mr rausi .
" it browses the net for that information and once it is found , it sends that it direct to your computer and stores it on your c drive . "

mamma mia ! opened in london in 1999 -lrb- photo by catherine ashmore -rrb- three million people have seen the original london production , and a further 14 million have seen it around the world .
in west end terms the show is a relative newcomer , lagging some way behind les miserables -lrb- now in its 18th year -rrb- and the phantom of the opera , which celebrated its 7,000th performance in the capital last august .
however , abba 's international popularity has made the musical easy to export to other countries .
the show is currently running in new york , las vegas , toronto , tokyo , seoul , hamburg and the dutch city of utrecht .
further productions are planned in spain , sweden and china - and that does not include the versions currently touring america and australasia .
the musical generates $ 8m -lrb- £ 4.4m -rrb- a week in ticket sales and has made more than $ 750 million -lrb- £ 412m -rrb- at the box office .
hard to believe , then , that the notion of a musical featuring songs from abba 's back catalogue was originally considered a risky proposition .
coherent storyline " we really had no idea how it was going to be received , " says producer judy craymer on the show 's official website .
" i knew from the outset that mamma mia ! had to be much more than just an abba compilation or tribute show . "
the show is set on a greek island -lrb- photo by catherine ashmore -rrb- to that end , playwright catherine johnson was commissioned to write an original script that incorporated the songs within a coherent storyline .
set on a small greek island , the musical tells of a young woman , sophie , and her fiercely independent mother , donna .
sophie , who is about to be married , has secretly invited three of her mother 's former lovers to her wedding in the hope of discovering which of them is her biological father .
" it was very important that i created believable characters and gave them all a true storyline , " says johnson on the mamma mia ! website .
" i absolutely worked to get the story and the songs to work together . "
terrorist attacks although abba are not mentioned by name , many of their songs are featured - among them the winner takes it all , super trouper , gimme !
gimme !
gimme ! and money , money , money .
the latter is particularly apt as both johnson and craymer - along with the show 's original director phyllida lloyd - have been made millionaires by its worldwide success .
mamma mia ! takes its title and score from the songs of abba that success was not guaranteed , however .
the show opened on broadway a month after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , at a time when falling ticket sales forced many other shows to close .
luckily mamma mia ! already had a $ 30m -lrb- £ 16.5m -rrb- box office advance , so the musical opened as planned .
last month it celebrated its 1,000th performance at new york 's cadillac winter garden theatre - formerly the home of andrew lloyd webber 's cats .
tuesday 's fifth anniversary performance at london 's prince edward theatre coincides with the 30th anniversary of abba 's eurovision song contest win with waterloo .
songwriters bjorn ulvaeus and benny andersson are scheduled to attend , and there are unconfirmed rumours they will be joined on stage by former bandmates agnetha faltskog and anni-frid lyngstad .
if so , it will mark abba 's first official reunion since the legendary band broke up in the early 1980s .
however , the scandinavian supergroup did reform briefly last year - to sing for a friend at her private birthday party .

mamma mia ! opened in london in 1999 -lrb- photo by catherine ashmore -rrb- three million people have seen the original london production , and a further 14 million have seen it around the world .
in west end terms the show is a relative newcomer , lagging some way behind les miserables -lrb- now in its 18th year -rrb- and the phantom of the opera , which celebrated its 7,000th performance in the capital last august .
however , abba 's international popularity has made the musical easy to export to other countries .
the show is currently running in new york , las vegas , toronto , tokyo , seoul , hamburg and the dutch city of utrecht .
further productions are planned in spain , sweden and china - and that does not include the versions currently touring america and australasia .
the musical generates $ 8m -lrb- £ 4.4m -rrb- a week in ticket sales and has made more than $ 750 million -lrb- £ 412m -rrb- at the box office .
hard to believe , then , that the notion of a musical featuring songs from abba 's back catalogue was originally considered a risky proposition .
coherent storyline " we really had no idea how it was going to be received , " says producer judy craymer on the show 's official website .
" i knew from the outset that mamma mia ! had to be much more than just an abba compilation or tribute show . "
the show is set on a greek island -lrb- photo by catherine ashmore -rrb- to that end , playwright catherine johnson was commissioned to write an original script that incorporated the songs within a coherent storyline .
set on a small greek island , the musical tells of a young woman , sophie , and her fiercely independent mother , donna .
sophie , who is about to be married , has secretly invited three of her mother 's former lovers to her wedding in the hope of discovering which of them is her biological father .
" it was very important that i created believable characters and gave them all a true storyline , " says johnson on the mamma mia ! website .
" i absolutely worked to get the story and the songs to work together . "
terrorist attacks although abba are not mentioned by name , many of their songs are featured - among them the winner takes it all , super trouper , gimme !
gimme !
gimme ! and money , money , money .
the latter is particularly apt as both johnson and craymer - along with the show 's original director phyllida lloyd - have been made millionaires by its worldwide success .
mamma mia ! takes its title and score from the songs of abba that success was not guaranteed , however .
the show opened on broadway a month after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , at a time when falling ticket sales forced many other shows to close .
luckily mamma mia ! already had a $ 30m -lrb- £ 16.5m -rrb- box office advance , so the musical opened as planned .
last month it celebrated its 1,000th performance at new york 's cadillac winter garden theatre - formerly the home of andrew lloyd webber 's cats .
tuesday 's fifth anniversary performance at london 's prince edward theatre coincides with the 30th anniversary of abba 's eurovision song contest win with waterloo .
songwriters bjorn ulvaeus and benny andersson are scheduled to attend , and there are unconfirmed rumours they will be joined on stage by former bandmates agnetha faltskog and anni-frid lyngstad .
if so , it will mark abba 's first official reunion since the legendary band broke up in the early 1980s .
however , the scandinavian supergroup did reform briefly last year - to sing for a friend at her private birthday party .

labour msp pauline mcneill is tabling a scottish parliamentary motion calling on mr mcconnell to back an appeal to save kenny richey 's life .
edinburgh-born richey has maintained his innocence since being convicted of arson and the aggravated murder of a child in a fire in ohio in 1986 .
he has been on death row for 18 years after refusing a plea-bargain .
standing firm if richey had taken the plea he would have been paroled more than a decade ago .
but he refuses to admit to the crime and has maintained his innocence .
in the past he has told the bbc : " i 'm innocent and i 'm gonna stand by that and i 'll stand by that until the day they kill me . "
ms mcneill wants mr mcconnell to urge westminster and prime minister tony blair to make " direct and robust representations " to the us authorities on richey 's behalf .
there are a number of key pieces of evidence which have emerged which tend to suggest that they might undermine the original conviction pauline mcneill more than 100 mps have already signed an commons motion backing richey 's appeal .
last month , junior foreign office minister chris mullin said the uk authorities were doing everything possible to prevent his execution .
the vow came after mr blair promised those campaigning to prove richey 's innocence that he would look into the scot 's case .
ms mcneill , the msp for glasgow kelvin and convener of the scottish parliament 's justice committee , said : " the new evidence in kenny richey 's case seems persuasive and i believe he should be given the chance to present it in court .
" there are a number of key pieces of evidence which have emerged which tend to suggest that they might undermine the original conviction .
new evidence " tony blair and his ministers have a lot of popular support in the us .
" they should take advantage of that opportunity to support kenny 's case .
" what i 'm simply doing is assisting amnesty international and highlighting the case in scotland .
" it 's about highlighting the importance of the case to scots and ensuring the scottish parliament are aware that there is a scot on death row in ohio . "
a scottish executive spokesman said : " the first minister is aware the foreign office is dealing with this and it is not appropriate to comment any further " final decision a us court of appeal is expected to make a final decision on 7 may about whether richey should face execution .
amnesty international is urging the ohio state authorities to allow richey 's death sentence appeal in the light of new evidence .
in february , amnesty uk director kate allen visited mr richey at the mansfield correctional facility , ohio , to find him shackled to the floor .
after the visit , she said : " his case is one of the most compelling of apparent innocence that human rights campaigners have ever seen . "
amnesty said 113 prisoners had been released from death row in the us since 1973 after evidence emerged of their innocence .

ms mcneill , the msp for glasgow kelvin and convener of the scottish parliament 's justice committee , said : " the new evidence in kenny richey 's case seems persuasive and i believe he should be given the chance to present it in court .
" there are a number of key pieces of evidence which have emerged which tend to suggest that they might undermine the original conviction .
new evidence " tony blair and his ministers have a lot of popular support in the us .
" they should take advantage of that opportunity to support kenny 's case .
" what i 'm simply doing is assisting amnesty international and highlighting the case in scotland .
" it 's about highlighting the importance of the case to scots and ensuring the scottish parliament are aware that there is a scot on death row in ohio . "
a scottish executive spokesman said : " the first minister is aware the foreign office is dealing with this and it is not appropriate to comment any further " final decision a us court of appeal is expected to make a final decision on 7 may about whether richey should face execution .
amnesty international is urging the ohio state authorities to allow richey 's death sentence appeal in the light of new evidence .
in february , amnesty uk director kate allen visited mr richey at the mansfield correctional facility , ohio , to find him shackled to the floor .
after the visit , she said : " his case is one of the most compelling of apparent innocence that human rights campaigners have ever seen . "
amnesty said 113 prisoners had been released from death row in the us since 1973 after evidence emerged of their innocence .

he has been on death row for 18 years after refusing a plea-bargain .
standing firm if richey had taken the plea he would have been paroled more than a decade ago .
but he refuses to admit to the crime and has maintained his innocence .
in the past he has told the bbc : " i 'm innocent and i 'm gonna stand by that and i 'll stand by that until the day they kill me . "
ms mcneill wants mr mcconnell to urge westminster and prime minister tony blair to make " direct and robust representations " to the us authorities on richey 's behalf .
there are a number of key pieces of evidence which have emerged which tend to suggest that they might undermine the original conviction pauline mcneill more than 100 mps have already signed an commons motion backing richey 's appeal .
last month , junior foreign office minister chris mullin said the uk authorities were doing everything possible to prevent his execution .
the vow came after mr blair promised those campaigning to prove richey 's innocence that he would look into the scot 's case .
ms mcneill , the msp for glasgow kelvin and convener of the scottish parliament 's justice committee , said : " the new evidence in kenny richey 's case seems persuasive and i believe he should be given the chance to present it in court .
" there are a number of key pieces of evidence which have emerged which tend to suggest that they might undermine the original conviction .
new evidence " tony blair and his ministers have a lot of popular support in the us .
" they should take advantage of that opportunity to support kenny 's case .
" what i 'm simply doing is assisting amnesty international and highlighting the case in scotland .
" it 's about highlighting the importance of the case to scots and ensuring the scottish parliament are aware that there is a scot on death row in ohio . "
a scottish executive spokesman said : " the first minister is aware the foreign office is dealing with this and it is not appropriate to comment any further " final decision a us court of appeal is expected to make a final decision on 7 may about whether richey should face execution .
amnesty international is urging the ohio state authorities to allow richey 's death sentence appeal in the light of new evidence .
in february , amnesty uk director kate allen visited mr richey at the mansfield correctional facility , ohio , to find him shackled to the floor .
after the visit , she said : " his case is one of the most compelling of apparent innocence that human rights campaigners have ever seen . "
amnesty said 113 prisoners had been released from death row in the us since 1973 after evidence emerged of their innocence .

knowing about google does not equal knowing how to use google , or any other search engine for that matter , effectively .
today 's search engines are not evolved enough to guess what we mean when we type in a single-word search query while looking for answers to complex questions .

the roofie foundation , britain 's only specialised agency dealing with the issues surrounding drug rape and sexual abuse , received almost 1,000 reported cases to its helpline last year .
while it is principally seen as a danger to women , around 15 % of the reported victims are men .
