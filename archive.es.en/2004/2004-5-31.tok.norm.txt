ever since germany replaced the deutsch mark with the euro in january 2002 , consumers have been griping about a hike in prices .
a new study proves that it 's all in their heads . academics at the technical university in dresden gave 1,500 people two menus .
one with dishes listed in deutsch marks , the beloved currency that accompanied germany out of the ashes of wwii .
one with the euro , the symbol of monetary unity in europe that has , at times , been anything but since going into circulation in 12 countries on jan .
1 , 2002 . the result was to supposed to be the last word on a debate raging in germany since the euro 's introduction : have prices really risen since the deutsche mark left ? consumers certainly think so .
anti-euro campaigners warned of cataclysmic prices increases following the introduction of the euro .
almost immediately after the euro came into regular circulation , germans complained that everything from cars to the beloved turkish sandwich , the doener , had seen markups . can i pay with chiemgauer ? " long before the euro was introduced , we were being told that the cost of living would get more expensive after january 2002 , " stefan schulz-hardt , who helped organize the study told die welt newspaper . some chanelled their aggression by calling for boycotts of the " teuro , " from the german word " teuer , " meaning expensive .
department stores offered customers the chance to pay in deutsche marks .
the special deals were designed both to let customers get rid of their remaining marks and to encourage spending in a currency germans felt more comfortable with . a high school in the small town of prien even made up a new currency , the " chiemgauer , " that soon became a popular alternative in town stores . a psychological price increase all the while germany 's bundesbank as well as economists remained adamant that prices had not rocketed .
the bundesbank did record a 2.1 percent hike in prices upon the euro 's introduction , but the national bank attributed the increase to energy , insurance and tobacco taxes introduced at the same time . the bank also saw found something else in its most recent report : by assuming 100 euros was automatically 200dm and not the bank-mandated rate of 195,58dm , the consumer " increased " prices by 2.3 percent . the dresden study proved much the same thing . experiment participants were asked to guess how big a price difference existed between the two currencies .
the study showed that participants thought a price increase of 15 percent to be closer to 20 percent .
when the academics gave the participants menus with no price increase at all , they thought the " euro menu " was 10 percent more expensive . whether that 's the final word remains to be seen .
but among the many reasons germans have had for keeping their wallets closed , the " teuro " argument , at least , seems to be losing currency . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving the euro the cold shoulder the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.05.2004 shattering the euro myth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans think the new currency has hit their wallets hard .
ever since germany replaced the deutsch mark with the euro in january 2002 , consumers have been griping about a hike in prices .
a new study proves that it 's all in their heads . academics at the technical university in dresden gave 1,500 people two menus .
one with dishes listed in deutsch marks , the beloved currency that accompanied germany out of the ashes of wwii .
one with the euro , the symbol of monetary unity in europe that has , at times , been anything but since going into circulation in 12 countries on jan .
1 , 2002 . the result was to supposed to be the last word on a debate raging in germany since the euro 's introduction : have prices really risen since the deutsche mark left ? consumers certainly think so .
anti-euro campaigners warned of cataclysmic prices increases following the introduction of the euro .
almost immediately after the euro came into regular circulation , germans complained that everything from cars to the beloved turkish sandwich , the doener , had seen markups . can i pay with chiemgauer ? " long before the euro was introduced , we were being told that the cost of living would get more expensive after january 2002 , " stefan schulz-hardt , who helped organize the study told die welt newspaper . some chanelled their aggression by calling for boycotts of the " teuro , " from the german word " teuer , " meaning expensive .
department stores offered customers the chance to pay in deutsche marks .
the special deals were designed both to let customers get rid of their remaining marks and to encourage spending in a currency germans felt more comfortable with . a high school in the small town of prien even made up a new currency , the " chiemgauer , " that soon became a popular alternative in town stores . a psychological price increase all the while germany 's bundesbank as well as economists remained adamant that prices had not rocketed .
the bundesbank did record a 2.1 percent hike in prices upon the euro 's introduction , but the national bank attributed the increase to energy , insurance and tobacco taxes introduced at the same time . the bank also saw found something else in its most recent report : by assuming 100 euros was automatically 200dm and not the bank-mandated rate of 195,58dm , the consumer " increased " prices by 2.3 percent . the dresden study proved much the same thing . experiment participants were asked to guess how big a price difference existed between the two currencies .
the study showed that participants thought a price increase of 15 percent to be closer to 20 percent .
when the academics gave the participants menus with no price increase at all , they thought the " euro menu " was 10 percent more expensive . whether that 's the final word remains to be seen .
but among the many reasons germans have had for keeping their wallets closed , the " teuro " argument , at least , seems to be losing currency . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving the euro the cold shoulder the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . "

3 , 2003 -rrb- still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

a raft of reforms aimed at increasing turkey 's chances to get into the european union caused the unexpected delay of an al-qaeda terror trail - the court in which it was held was abolished . over the next week , 69 people suspected of involvement in two bomb attacks in istanbul in nov .
2003 that killed 63 people , were to go before a judge in the state security court .
but just hours before the trial was to begin , defense lawyers were able to successfully argue that eu guidelines requesting the abolishment of the state security court meant that the court could not hear the case .
turkish president ahmet necdet sezer signed a raft of legislation changing the constitution this month .
the changes were made last year as part of turkey 's efforts to show the european union that they are a serious candidate for membership .
the state security court , normally set aside for corruption and terrorist trials , was deemed inappropriate for possible future eu membership .
as a result , officials in the justice ministry have set about drafting a bill that would create a new , replacement court .
justice minister cemil cicek said such a law would be in place in two weeks , according to a turkish newspaper .
sentences of five years to life in prison until then , the trial of the 69 has been indefinitely delayed .
the first 12 , among them the five suspected of planning the bomb attacks , were to appear before the judge .
prosecutors say they belong to a terror group affiliated with al qaeda .
on nov .
15 , they allegedly positioned two explosives-packed trucks in front of two istanbul synagogues killing at least 20 people and injuring hundreds .
five days later , two other trucks hit british-owned hsbc bank and the british consulate , killing among others the consul general robert short . the five face could face life in prison if convicted .
the remaining suspects have been charged with crimes including from membership in a terrorist organization and could face at least 4.5 to 22.5 years behind bars . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish police foil suspected nato summit terror attack security forces in northwestern turkey are claiming to have cracked a radical islamist cell which they believe was planning a bomb attack against the nato summit in istanbul in june .

a raft of reforms aimed at increasing turkey 's chances to get into the european union caused the unexpected delay of an al-qaeda terror trail - the court in which it was held was abolished . over the next week , 69 people suspected of involvement in two bomb attacks in istanbul in nov .
2003 that killed 63 people , were to go before a judge in the state security court .
but just hours before the trial was to begin , defense lawyers were able to successfully argue that eu guidelines requesting the abolishment of the state security court meant that the court could not hear the case .
turkish president ahmet necdet sezer signed a raft of legislation changing the constitution this month .
the changes were made last year as part of turkey 's efforts to show the european union that they are a serious candidate for membership .
the state security court , normally set aside for corruption and terrorist trials , was deemed inappropriate for possible future eu membership .
as a result , officials in the justice ministry have set about drafting a bill that would create a new , replacement court .
justice minister cemil cicek said such a law would be in place in two weeks , according to a turkish newspaper .
sentences of five years to life in prison until then , the trial of the 69 has been indefinitely delayed .
the first 12 , among them the five suspected of planning the bomb attacks , were to appear before the judge .
prosecutors say they belong to a terror group affiliated with al qaeda .
on nov .
15 , they allegedly positioned two explosives-packed trucks in front of two istanbul synagogues killing at least 20 people and injuring hundreds .
five days later , two other trucks hit british-owned hsbc bank and the british consulate , killing among others the consul general robert short . the five face could face life in prison if convicted .
the remaining suspects have been charged with crimes including from membership in a terrorist organization and could face at least 4.5 to 22.5 years behind bars . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish police foil suspected nato summit terror attack security forces in northwestern turkey are claiming to have cracked a radical islamist cell which they believe was planning a bomb attack against the nato summit in istanbul in june .

ever since germany replaced the deutsch mark with the euro in january 2002 , consumers have been griping about a hike in prices .
a new study proves that it 's all in their heads . academics at the technical university in dresden gave 1,500 people two menus .
one with dishes listed in deutsch marks , the beloved currency that accompanied germany out of the ashes of wwii .
one with the euro , the symbol of monetary unity in europe that has , at times , been anything but since going into circulation in 12 countries on jan .
1 , 2002 . the result was to supposed to be the last word on a debate raging in germany since the euro 's introduction : have prices really risen since the deutsche mark left ? consumers certainly think so .
anti-euro campaigners warned of cataclysmic prices increases following the introduction of the euro .
almost immediately after the euro came into regular circulation , germans complained that everything from cars to the beloved turkish sandwich , the doener , had seen markups . can i pay with chiemgauer ? " long before the euro was introduced , we were being told that the cost of living would get more expensive after january 2002 , " stefan schulz-hardt , who helped organize the study told die welt newspaper . some chanelled their aggression by calling for boycotts of the " teuro , " from the german word " teuer , " meaning expensive .
department stores offered customers the chance to pay in deutsche marks .
the special deals were designed both to let customers get rid of their remaining marks and to encourage spending in a currency germans felt more comfortable with . a high school in the small town of prien even made up a new currency , the " chiemgauer , " that soon became a popular alternative in town stores . a psychological price increase all the while germany 's bundesbank as well as economists remained adamant that prices had not rocketed .
the bundesbank did record a 2.1 percent hike in prices upon the euro 's introduction , but the national bank attributed the increase to energy , insurance and tobacco taxes introduced at the same time . the bank also saw found something else in its most recent report : by assuming 100 euros was automatically 200dm and not the bank-mandated rate of 195,58dm , the consumer " increased " prices by 2.3 percent . the dresden study proved much the same thing . experiment participants were asked to guess how big a price difference existed between the two currencies .
the study showed that participants thought a price increase of 15 percent to be closer to 20 percent .
when the academics gave the participants menus with no price increase at all , they thought the " euro menu " was 10 percent more expensive . whether that 's the final word remains to be seen .
but among the many reasons germans have had for keeping their wallets closed , the " teuro " argument , at least , seems to be losing currency . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving the euro the cold shoulder the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . "
-lrb- nov .
3 , 2003 -rrb- still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .
their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money .

a raft of reforms aimed at increasing turkey 's chances to get into the european union caused the unexpected delay of an al-qaeda terror trail - the court in which it was held was abolished . over the next week , 69 people suspected of involvement in two bomb attacks in istanbul in nov .
2003 that killed 63 people , were to go before a judge in the state security court .
but just hours before the trial was to begin , defense lawyers were able to successfully argue that eu guidelines requesting the abolishment of the state security court meant that the court could not hear the case .
turkish president ahmet necdet sezer signed a raft of legislation changing the constitution this month .
the changes were made last year as part of turkey 's efforts to show the european union that they are a serious candidate for membership .
the state security court , normally set aside for corruption and terrorist trials , was deemed inappropriate for possible future eu membership .
as a result , officials in the justice ministry have set about drafting a bill that would create a new , replacement court .
justice minister cemil cicek said such a law would be in place in two weeks , according to a turkish newspaper .
sentences of five years to life in prison until then , the trial of the 69 has been indefinitely delayed .
the first 12 , among them the five suspected of planning the bomb attacks , were to appear before the judge .
prosecutors say they belong to a terror group affiliated with al qaeda .
on nov .
15 , they allegedly positioned two explosives-packed trucks in front of two istanbul synagogues killing at least 20 people and injuring hundreds .
five days later , two other trucks hit british-owned hsbc bank and the british consulate , killing among others the consul general robert short . the five face could face life in prison if convicted .
the remaining suspects have been charged with crimes including from membership in a terrorist organization and could face at least 4.5 to 22.5 years behind bars . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish police foil suspected nato summit terror attack security forces in northwestern turkey are claiming to have cracked a radical islamist cell which they believe was planning a bomb attack against the nato summit in istanbul in june .

a study by the british trust for ornithology says gardeners can make a difference by making space for birds .
the report has said wildlife friendly gardening is important for the future of threatened species like the song thrush and spotted flycatchers .
also , a study by the game conservancy trust has said that the endangered grey partridge population has risen .
safe haven britain 's gardens cover an area more than twice the size of all the country 's nature reserves .
if all of gardens were bird-friendly , the number of pairs of birds nesting nationwide could be 30 million richard bland , british trust for ornithology the report by the british trust for ornithology -lrb- bto -rrb- has said the garden 's role in providing a haven for wild birds is equally as important , and millions of pairs of birds have chosen to nest in britain .
the study is made up of information taken from 6,000 gardens , and ornithologists have produced new figures for the number of pairs of different species nesting in domestic properties .
the blue tit came top , followed by the house sparrow , the blackbird , the great tit , the starling and the robin - all these species had between one and three million pairs each .
the bto 's findings show that species like the song thrush and spotted flycatchers have been declining rapidly in the wild .
but the concentration of nesting birds is as high in built-up areas as it is in woodlands .
the estimate for the song thrush nesting in gardens was 300,000 pairs , up 100,000 on a previous estimate .
richard bland , one of the report 's authors , said : " if all of the gardens in britain were as bird-friendly as those surveyed , the total number of pairs of birds that would be nesting nationwide could be 30 million .
" that 's not bad when national surveys have shown there are only some 60 million pairs of birds in britain - and that 's everything from puffins to pigeons . "
grey partridge the survey by the game conservancy trust is also good news for a bird species that had plummeted in the 1950s and 1960s because of intensive farming .
song thrush numbers have significantly increased in britain 's gardens in 1911 it was estimated that there were a million pairs of breeding grey partridges , but by the early 1990s weed killers and modern crop methods had taken their toll .
about 145,000 pairs were left and monitoring has suggested that numbers have halved in the last decade .
the trust says the grey partridge has managed to boost its population numbers because of careful management of the birds ' habitat .
a project in hertfordshire has shown that leaving wild edges to intensively cultivated fields , and creating patches where the birds can forage , have been a significant help .
but a spokesman for the bto has said the long term population trend for the grey partridge is still downwards .

transport minister chan kong choy said the carrier is expected to collect 62.1 million ringgit each quarter from the fuel levy .

flyers will pay 15 ringgit -lrb- $ 3.95 -rrb- on each one-way flight to asian airports , and 50 ringgit -lrb- $ 13.20 -rrb- each way to non-asian destinations .
it follow similar moves from british airways , qantas , and air new zealand .
when oil prices reduce to $ 37.72 per barrel , and the price is sustained for 30 days , the surcharge will be removed .
airlines say there has been a 60 % rise in the price of jet fuel over the past year .
fuel makes up about 23 % of malaysia airlines ' total costs .
' sound commercial logic ' the carrier 's managing director , ahmad fuaad dahalan , said it was hedging 20 % of its fuel needs in the financial year to the end of march 2005 .
" malaysia airlines makes this move based on sound commercial logic and necessity and , along with other industry players , hopes the measure will be short-lived , " it said in a statement .
transport minister chan kong choy said the carrier is expected to collect 62.1 million ringgit each quarter from the fuel levy .
but this is not sufficient to offset an estimated additional cost of about 150 million ringgit each quarter it had to bear due to strong fuel prices , he said .
virgin blue , richard branson 's budget australian airline , has also put a levy on its ticket prices because of recent surges in crude oil costs .
continuing tensions in the middle east and increasing oil demand from the us and china have seen recent jumps in oil prices .

largely because handsets that can play polyphonic ringtones are becoming standard .
even the so-called nokia tune , the one that goes diddle-um-dum , diddle-um-dum , diddle-um dum-dum , has been updated for more melodic mobiles .
but the same has not necessarily happened to the music you get with the games you play on your phone .
good looks sadly , says kristian segerstrale of mobile game maker macrospace , there is no guarantee that just because a phone can play polyphonic ringtones it will do the same for games .
by contrast games on phones are looking better than they ever did .
" people have generally realised it 's not just about snake or retro asteroids , " says john ozimek , head of marketing for macrospace , " a mobile game does not mean you are compromising . "
audio in games looks set to get a lot better thanks , in part , to 80s pop pioneer thomas dolby .
mr dolby is the founder of software firm beatnik which has campaigned relentlessly in mobile phone technology forums for a standard way to create audio files for handsets .
the result now is the beatnik audio engine which looks set to make phone games sound as good as they look .
" the data descriptions produced by the engine are very small but you get a very rich audio experience , " says jeremy copp of beatnik .
" it means game makers do not have to build audio functionality into their game , it 's a standard interface to take advantage of that . "
small size one of the first games to take full advantage of the midi audio abilities of beatnik is fatal force made by macrospace .
mr copp says the sound files for the whole game are less than 20 kilobytes in size .
by comparison the image at the top of this story is almost half that size .
although phones that measure memory in megabytes are becoming available , mobile game makers aim at the middle of the market where processing power is still relatively puny .
anne-marie larkin , chief technology officer of mobile software firm esmertec , says mass market phones typically have onboard an arm 7 processor running at 30-50mhz .
" that 's a pretty small footprint , " she says , adding that consumers could take a long time to trade up to more powerful handsets .
the small size of the beatnik files means that game makers have much more freedom to use sounds and music at key moments in the game .
mr segerstrale says sorting out audio for games was much easier than almost every other aspect of producing a playable title for handsets .
old style sounds he says a typical game for a mobile phone would have to be written in six languages , conform to more than 83 different operator specifications and work on many different sorts of phones .
often , he says , they end up with hundreds of versions of games .
the standardised audio system means that , instead of just having sounds when aliens are killed , says mr segerstrale , sounds can be associated with many more events .
it makes it possible to make theme tunes for separate game screens and certain characters in the game can have their own signature tune .
jan weber , head of mobile games review site midlet review , says game sounds had come a long way .
" having started with beep sounds and music mobile gamers are now able to listen to nice music as well as to impressive sound effects . "
he likens phone music now to the standard that gamers got with the amiga and the commodore 64 .
but , he says , this is a big improvement on the days when he began reviewing games for phones such as the siemens al45i which provided only a few beeps for the bricks , worm and i-skiing games it had onboard .
the future , says mr copp , will involve the ability to sample and include real world sounds for screeching tyres in driving games or gunshots in shooters .

but the same has not necessarily happened to the music you get with the games you play on your phone .
good looks sadly , says kristian segerstrale of mobile game maker macrospace , there is no guarantee that just because a phone can play polyphonic ringtones it will do the same for games .
phone games are looking and sounding better by contrast games on phones are looking better than they ever did .
" people have generally realised it 's not just about snake or retro asteroids , " says john ozimek , head of marketing for macrospace , " a mobile game does not mean you are compromising . "
audio in games looks set to get a lot better thanks , in part , to 80s pop pioneer thomas dolby .
mr dolby is the founder of software firm beatnik which has campaigned relentlessly in mobile phone technology forums for a standard way to create audio files for handsets .
the result now is the beatnik audio engine which looks set to make phone games sound as good as they look .
" the data descriptions produced by the engine are very small but you get a very rich audio experience , " says jeremy copp of beatnik .

although phones that measure memory in megabytes are becoming available , mobile game makers aim at the middle of the market where processing power is still relatively puny .
anne-marie larkin , chief technology officer of mobile software firm esmertec , says mass market phones typically have onboard an arm 7 processor running at 30-50mhz .
" that 's a pretty small footprint , " she says , adding that consumers could take a long time to trade up to more powerful handsets .
the small size of the beatnik files means that game makers have much more freedom to use sounds and music at key moments in the game .
mr segerstrale says sorting out audio for games was much easier than almost every other aspect of producing a playable title for handsets .
old style sounds he says a typical game for a mobile phone would have to be written in six languages , conform to more than 83 different operator specifications and work on many different sorts of phones .
dedicated game phones are starting to appear often , he says , they end up with hundreds of versions of games .
the standardised audio system means that , instead of just having sounds when aliens are killed , says mr segerstrale , sounds can be associated with many more events .
it makes it possible to make theme tunes for separate game screens and certain characters in the game can have their own signature tune .

rocks in tunisia reveal microscopic cold-water creatures invaded a warm sea just after the space rock struck earth .
the global winter was probably caused by a pollutant cloud of sulphate particles released when the asteroid vapourised rocks at chicxulub , mexico .
the results are reported in the latest issue of the journal geology .
italian , us and dutch researchers studied rocks at el kef in tunisia which cover the cretaceous-tertiary -lrb- k-t -rrb- boundary , when dinosaurs - amongst other species - vanished from our planet .
sun block at the time of the dinosaurs , el-kef was part of the warm western tethys sea .
when the scientists studied the types of microscopic fossil creatures present in the tunisian rocks , they found some surprising changes after the k-t boundary .
firstly , two new species of benthic foraminifera - simple animals that live near the sea floor - appeared .
these newcomers were cold-water types found in more northerly oceans .
the impactor theory is the favoured candidate for the demise of the dinosaurs secondly , they found a curious difference in the shape of a microscopic snail-like creature called cibicidoides pseudoacutus .
this creature 's shell is said to coil in either a left or a right direction .
in cold waters there are proportionally more left-coiling individuals , while in warmer waters this pattern is reversed .
the researchers found a proportional increase in left-coiling cibicidoides , after the k-t boundary .
" it 's the first time we have found physical evidence for cooling at the k-t boundary , " said dr simone galeotti of the university of urbino , italy .
dr galeotti and his colleagues think the most likely cause of the cooling was a pollutant cloud of airborne sulphate particles , or aerosols , that blocked out sunlight .
heat ' switch ' these would have been released when the asteroid collision vapourised rocks rich in sulphate salts at chicxulub .
matthew huber of purdue university in indiana , us , calculated the global impact of the winter .
" the results we got are fairly consistent with the impact winter decreasing the amount of sunlight hitting the earth by 90 % .
if you turn off that heat source , the earth will cool in a big way , " he told bbc news online .
the oceans would have acted as a reservoir of heat to prevent the surface temperature of the planet from cooling too much .
however , this reservoir is not infinite .
if the sunlight was blocked out for long enough , the oceans would eventually have frozen solid .
" it must have been dark long enough to cool the oceans , but not long enough that the whole planet iced over - that 's not what we see in the fossil record , " said dr huber .
this impact-induced darkness would have lasted between one and ten years on land , but there is evidence for a cooling of up to 2,000 years at el kef .
positive feedback mechanisms may have prolonged the cooling effect of the impact winter in waters of intermediate depth - such as those at el kef - and deeper .

rocks in tunisia reveal microscopic cold-water creatures invaded a warm sea just after the space rock struck earth .
the global winter was probably caused by a pollutant cloud of sulphate particles released when the asteroid vapourised rocks at chicxulub , mexico .
the results are reported in the latest issue of the journal geology .
italian , us and dutch researchers studied rocks at el kef in tunisia which cover the cretaceous-tertiary -lrb- k-t -rrb- boundary , when dinosaurs - amongst other species - vanished from our planet .
sun block at the time of the dinosaurs , el-kef was part of the warm western tethys sea .
when the scientists studied the types of microscopic fossil creatures present in the tunisian rocks , they found some surprising changes after the k-t boundary .
firstly , two new species of benthic foraminifera - simple animals that live near the sea floor - appeared .
these newcomers were cold-water types found in more northerly oceans .
the impactor theory is the favoured candidate for the demise of the dinosaurs secondly , they found a curious difference in the shape of a microscopic snail-like creature called cibicidoides pseudoacutus .
this creature 's shell is said to coil in either a left or a right direction .
in cold waters there are proportionally more left-coiling individuals , while in warmer waters this pattern is reversed .
the researchers found a proportional increase in left-coiling cibicidoides , after the k-t boundary .
" it 's the first time we have found physical evidence for cooling at the k-t boundary , " said dr simone galeotti of the university of urbino , italy .
dr galeotti and his colleagues think the most likely cause of the cooling was a pollutant cloud of airborne sulphate particles , or aerosols , that blocked out sunlight .
heat ' switch ' these would have been released when the asteroid collision vapourised rocks rich in sulphate salts at chicxulub .
matthew huber of purdue university in indiana , us , calculated the global impact of the winter .
" the results we got are fairly consistent with the impact winter decreasing the amount of sunlight hitting the earth by 90 % .
if you turn off that heat source , the earth will cool in a big way , " he told bbc news online .
the oceans would have acted as a reservoir of heat to prevent the surface temperature of the planet from cooling too much .
however , this reservoir is not infinite .
if the sunlight was blocked out for long enough , the oceans would eventually have frozen solid .
" it must have been dark long enough to cool the oceans , but not long enough that the whole planet iced over - that 's not what we see in the fossil record , " said dr huber .
this impact-induced darkness would have lasted between one and ten years on land , but there is evidence for a cooling of up to 2,000 years at el kef .
positive feedback mechanisms may have prolonged the cooling effect of the impact winter in waters of intermediate depth - such as those at el kef - and deeper .

one of the main aims of the proposal was to move prostitution out of residential areas in to an area that could be closely monitored .
the zone would have a health clinic and would be managed and policed by specially-trained workers .
the home office is currently considering the proposal to introduce the zone in a pilot project .
survey online earlier this year dutch police visited liverpool to give advice about how similar schemes are operated in the netherlands .
if the zone is approved , it would also contain education and training facilities for prostitutes to use .
the consultation , carried out by john moores university and public health experts , will evaluate how residents , businesses , community groups and prostitutes themselves .
