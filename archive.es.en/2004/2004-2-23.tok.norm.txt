putting their signatures to the founding charter of a united european greens party in rome , delegates from 32 countries formalized the creation of the first europe-wide political party on sunday . in a historic first , green parties from across europe united under the banner of a new european green party at a two-day pre-election congress in rome . the event , rich in symbolism as it takes place in the birthplace of the european union , was opened on friday by german foreign minister joschka fischer , a prominent member of europe 's strongest green party . delegates , which included the heads of 32 green parties from the 15 member states of the european union as well as the 10 future members who will join on may 1 , launched a regional manifesto at the meeting .
as a result , the united greens will be the only party fighting the european election on a common manifesto . " european-izing the greens ' campaign " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the move marks a significant move forward for the greens , according to daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , co-president of the greens in the european parliament .
" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .
" we 're now launching an integrated poll campaign .
we 've found a common political form of expression .
we now have a common agency and we 'll intertwine our campaign appearances , " he said .
for instance , joschka fischer will not just campaign in germany , but also in neighboring countries for the european elections . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china nuclear deal threatens to split german coalition the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .

unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .

in the 19th century , germans helped build the baghdad railway connecting turkey to iraq .
turkey remains an important trading partner today and german businessmen are eager to tap into the market of the future . one of the stops on chancellor gerhard schröder 's brief trip through turkey on monday will be an enormous coal power plant near the syrian border .
for the past three months the steag plant has been supplying turkey with 8 percent of its energy .
steag is a daughter company of germany 's coal and chemical producer rag and the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- invested in the plant is the single biggest german investment in turkey . but it is by far not the only one .
the mediterranean country is not only politically interesting for germany , but holds great economic potential as well .
fifteen top managers , from companies such as basf , thyssenkrupp and the deutsche bahn are accompanying chancellor schröder during his visit .
there are already more than 1,000 turkish-german companies in turkey , making up 40 percent of all foreign investment in the country , according to the german industry association . with deutsche bank to baghdad " this is a market of the future , and germany needs to find other markets at the moment , " ahmet güler , of the alliance of european-turkish entrepreneurs association , told dw-world .
" china and turkey are growth markets . " germany and turkey already have historic economic ties dating back to the mid-19th century .
in 1888 , at the encouragement of german military men training the ottoman army , deutsche bank headed a consortium that won the bid to build the baghdad railway which connected europe to asia minor and the middle east . today , germany is turkey 's most important trading partner and last year , german exports to turkey increased more than 25 percent , according to güler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes benz sells well in the middle east cars , machines and it products , traditionally strong markets worldwide for germany are in demand in turkey , said güler .
more important , perhaps , is the access turkey can provide german companies to the surrounding middle eastern regions . " german business has a large interest in using turkey as an opening into these other markets , " said güler , who is currently in ankara with schröder .
the head of the german industry association , a proponent of turkey 's eu drive , is planning a trip to discuss business ties in april . democratic reforms tied to economic success in exchange , turkey is looking for german help in convicing the european commission in december that it is ready to start eu membership negotiations .
until now , the eu has supported turkey 's reform drive but says there are still major problems in the areas of human rights and freedom of religion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , right , and german chancellor gerhard schroeder listen to their nations ' anthems during a welcoming ceremony for schroeder in ankara on monday , feb .
23 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / burhan ozbilici -rrb- schröder has said that a negotiation date will give turkey the necessary resolve to complete further reforms , something that is crucial for bilateral trade ties as well . turkey is aiming for membership some time in 2015 . " turkey can only be a strong business partner if it elevates its democracy to eu standards , " güler said . the european union 's expansion this may into eastern europe and the mediterranean may serve as a testing ground for gauging the viability of turkey 's membership , according to the head of the german trade union federation . anti-membership politicians from the german conservative opposition may repeat arguments over cheap labor flooding european markets and investment competition . but union chief michael sommer is convinced of the long-term benefits .
" there will be difficulties at the beginning , " sommer said . " but it will be good in the long term for german companies and workers , because there will be new markets .

" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.02.2004 german chancellor will support ankara in eu drive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this way to the eu , please : erdogan and schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder began talks monday morning with turkish leader tayyip erdogan in ankara .
unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .
he 's expected to make clear to schröder what he expects in return . rainer sollich -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

kpn chief ad scheepbouwer suggested that mmo2 could be subjected to a hostile takeover by kpn , a statement which he later took back .
analysts have said that o2 , the smallest of the four domestic mobile telephone providers , is too small to survive on the german market .

putting their signatures to the founding charter of a united european greens party in rome , delegates from 32 countries formalized the creation of the first europe-wide political party on sunday . in a historic first , green parties from across europe united under the banner of a new european green party at a two-day pre-election congress in rome . the event , rich in symbolism as it takes place in the birthplace of the european union , was opened on friday by german foreign minister joschka fischer , a prominent member of europe 's strongest green party . delegates , which included the heads of 32 green parties from the 15 member states of the european union as well as the 10 future members who will join on may 1 , launched a regional manifesto at the meeting .
as a result , the united greens will be the only party fighting the european election on a common manifesto . " european-izing the greens ' campaign " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the move marks a significant move forward for the greens , according to daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , co-president of the greens in the european parliament .
" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .
" we 're now launching an integrated poll campaign .
we 've found a common political form of expression .
we now have a common agency and we 'll intertwine our campaign appearances , " he said .
for instance , joschka fischer will not just campaign in germany , but also in neighboring countries for the european elections . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china nuclear deal threatens to split german coalition the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .

kpn chief ad scheepbouwer suggested that mmo2 could be subjected to a hostile takeover by kpn , a statement which he later took back .
analysts have said that o2 , the smallest of the four domestic mobile telephone providers , is too small to survive on the german market .

unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .

instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .
he 's expected to make clear to schröder what he expects in return . rainer sollich -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

putting their signatures to the founding charter of a united european greens party in rome , delegates from 32 countries formalized the creation of the first europe-wide political party on sunday . in a historic first , green parties from across europe united under the banner of a new european green party at a two-day pre-election congress in rome . the event , rich in symbolism as it takes place in the birthplace of the european union , was opened on friday by german foreign minister joschka fischer , a prominent member of europe 's strongest green party . delegates , which included the heads of 32 green parties from the 15 member states of the european union as well as the 10 future members who will join on may 1 , launched a regional manifesto at the meeting .
as a result , the united greens will be the only party fighting the european election on a common manifesto . " european-izing the greens ' campaign " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the move marks a significant move forward for the greens , according to daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , co-president of the greens in the european parliament .
" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .
" we 're now launching an integrated poll campaign .
we 've found a common political form of expression .
we now have a common agency and we 'll intertwine our campaign appearances , " he said .

in the 19th century , germans helped build the baghdad railway connecting turkey to iraq .
turkey remains an important trading partner today and german businessmen are eager to tap into the market of the future . one of the stops on chancellor gerhard schröder 's brief trip through turkey on monday will be an enormous coal power plant near the syrian border .
for the past three months the steag plant has been supplying turkey with 8 percent of its energy .
steag is a daughter company of germany 's coal and chemical producer rag and the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- invested in the plant is the single biggest german investment in turkey . but it is by far not the only one .
the mediterranean country is not only politically interesting for germany , but holds great economic potential as well .
fifteen top managers , from companies such as basf , thyssenkrupp and the deutsche bahn are accompanying chancellor schröder during his visit .
there are already more than 1,000 turkish-german companies in turkey , making up 40 percent of all foreign investment in the country , according to the german industry association . with deutsche bank to baghdad " this is a market of the future , and germany needs to find other markets at the moment , " ahmet güler , of the alliance of european-turkish entrepreneurs association , told dw-world .
" china and turkey are growth markets . " germany and turkey already have historic economic ties dating back to the mid-19th century .
in 1888 , at the encouragement of german military men training the ottoman army , deutsche bank headed a consortium that won the bid to build the baghdad railway which connected europe to asia minor and the middle east . today , germany is turkey 's most important trading partner and last year , german exports to turkey increased more than 25 percent , according to güler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes benz sells well in the middle east cars , machines and it products , traditionally strong markets worldwide for germany are in demand in turkey , said güler .
more important , perhaps , is the access turkey can provide german companies to the surrounding middle eastern regions . " german business has a large interest in using turkey as an opening into these other markets , " said güler , who is currently in ankara with schröder .
the head of the german industry association , a proponent of turkey 's eu drive , is planning a trip to discuss business ties in april . democratic reforms tied to economic success in exchange , turkey is looking for german help in convicing the european commission in december that it is ready to start eu membership negotiations .
until now , the eu has supported turkey 's reform drive but says there are still major problems in the areas of human rights and freedom of religion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , right , and german chancellor gerhard schroeder listen to their nations ' anthems during a welcoming ceremony for schroeder in ankara on monday , feb .

-lrb- ap photo / burhan ozbilici -rrb- schröder has said that a negotiation date will give turkey the necessary resolve to complete further reforms , something that is crucial for bilateral trade ties as well . turkey is aiming for membership some time in 2015 . " turkey can only be a strong business partner if it elevates its democracy to eu standards , " güler said . the european union 's expansion this may into eastern europe and the mediterranean may serve as a testing ground for gauging the viability of turkey 's membership , according to the head of the german trade union federation . anti-membership politicians from the german conservative opposition may repeat arguments over cheap labor flooding european markets and investment competition . but union chief michael sommer is convinced of the long-term benefits .
" there will be difficulties at the beginning , " sommer said . " but it will be good in the long term for german companies and workers , because there will be new markets .

putting their signatures to the founding charter of a united european greens party in rome , delegates from 32 countries formalized the creation of the first europe-wide political party on sunday . in a historic first , green parties from across europe united under the banner of a new european green party at a two-day pre-election congress in rome . the event , rich in symbolism as it takes place in the birthplace of the european union , was opened on friday by german foreign minister joschka fischer , a prominent member of europe 's strongest green party . delegates , which included the heads of 32 green parties from the 15 member states of the european union as well as the 10 future members who will join on may 1 , launched a regional manifesto at the meeting .
as a result , the united greens will be the only party fighting the european election on a common manifesto . " european-izing the greens ' campaign " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the move marks a significant move forward for the greens , according to daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , co-president of the greens in the european parliament .
" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .
" we 're now launching an integrated poll campaign .
we 've found a common political form of expression .
we now have a common agency and we 'll intertwine our campaign appearances , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.02.2004 german chancellor will support ankara in eu drive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this way to the eu , please : erdogan and schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder began talks monday morning with turkish leader tayyip erdogan in ankara .
unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .
he 's expected to make clear to schröder what he expects in return . rainer sollich -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.02.2004 german chancellor will support ankara in eu drive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this way to the eu , please : erdogan and schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder began talks monday morning with turkish leader tayyip erdogan in ankara .
unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .
he 's expected to make clear to schröder what he expects in return . rainer sollich -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.02.2004 german chancellor will support ankara in eu drive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this way to the eu , please : erdogan and schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder began talks monday morning with turkish leader tayyip erdogan in ankara .
unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .
he 's expected to make clear to schröder what he expects in return . rainer sollich -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

turkey remains an important trading partner today and german businessmen are eager to tap into the market of the future . one of the stops on chancellor gerhard schröder 's brief trip through turkey on monday will be an enormous coal power plant near the syrian border .
for the past three months the steag plant has been supplying turkey with 8 percent of its energy .
steag is a daughter company of germany 's coal and chemical producer rag and the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- invested in the plant is the single biggest german investment in turkey . but it is by far not the only one .
the mediterranean country is not only politically interesting for germany , but holds great economic potential as well .

more important , perhaps , is the access turkey can provide german companies to the surrounding middle eastern regions . " german business has a large interest in using turkey as an opening into these other markets , " said güler , who is currently in ankara with schröder .
the head of the german industry association , a proponent of turkey 's eu drive , is planning a trip to discuss business ties in april . democratic reforms tied to economic success in exchange , turkey is looking for german help in convicing the european commission in december that it is ready to start eu membership negotiations .

unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .
he 's expected to make clear to schröder what he expects in return . rainer sollich -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

kpn chief ad scheepbouwer suggested that mmo2 could be subjected to a hostile takeover by kpn , a statement which he later took back .
analysts have said that o2 , the smallest of the four domestic mobile telephone providers , is too small to survive on the german market .

she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .

kpn chief ad scheepbouwer suggested that mmo2 could be subjected to a hostile takeover by kpn , a statement which he later took back .
analysts have said that o2 , the smallest of the four domestic mobile telephone providers , is too small to survive on the german market .
a merger between o2 and e-plus could be a force for leaders vodaphone and t-mobile to contend with . more briefs 20.02.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler not giving up on truck toll 20.02.2004 -pipe- basf to compensate u.s. farmers 20.02.2004 -pipe- germany joins list of poor eu members 19.02.2004 -pipe- toll collect debacle could hurt daimler profit 19.02.2004 -pipe- german travel company buys english airport 18.02.2004 -pipe- volkswagen profit drastically falls in fourth quarter 18.02.2004 -pipe- german producer prices unexpectedly fall 18.02.2004 -pipe- trucking firms seek compensation for failed toll system 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

putting their signatures to the founding charter of a united european greens party in rome , delegates from 32 countries formalized the creation of the first europe-wide political party on sunday . in a historic first , green parties from across europe united under the banner of a new european green party at a two-day pre-election congress in rome . the event , rich in symbolism as it takes place in the birthplace of the european union , was opened on friday by german foreign minister joschka fischer , a prominent member of europe 's strongest green party . delegates , which included the heads of 32 green parties from the 15 member states of the european union as well as the 10 future members who will join on may 1 , launched a regional manifesto at the meeting .
as a result , the united greens will be the only party fighting the european election on a common manifesto . " european-izing the greens ' campaign " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the move marks a significant move forward for the greens , according to daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , co-president of the greens in the european parliament .
" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .

" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution .

the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .

austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.02.2004 german chancellor will support ankara in eu drive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this way to the eu , please : erdogan and schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder began talks monday morning with turkish leader tayyip erdogan in ankara .
unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .
he 's expected to make clear to schröder what he expects in return . rainer sollich -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

in the 19th century , germans helped build the baghdad railway connecting turkey to iraq .
turkey remains an important trading partner today and german businessmen are eager to tap into the market of the future . one of the stops on chancellor gerhard schröder 's brief trip through turkey on monday will be an enormous coal power plant near the syrian border .
for the past three months the steag plant has been supplying turkey with 8 percent of its energy .
steag is a daughter company of germany 's coal and chemical producer rag and the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- invested in the plant is the single biggest german investment in turkey . but it is by far not the only one .
the mediterranean country is not only politically interesting for germany , but holds great economic potential as well .
fifteen top managers , from companies such as basf , thyssenkrupp and the deutsche bahn are accompanying chancellor schröder during his visit .
there are already more than 1,000 turkish-german companies in turkey , making up 40 percent of all foreign investment in the country , according to the german industry association . with deutsche bank to baghdad " this is a market of the future , and germany needs to find other markets at the moment , " ahmet güler , of the alliance of european-turkish entrepreneurs association , told dw-world .
" china and turkey are growth markets . " germany and turkey already have historic economic ties dating back to the mid-19th century .
in 1888 , at the encouragement of german military men training the ottoman army , deutsche bank headed a consortium that won the bid to build the baghdad railway which connected europe to asia minor and the middle east . today , germany is turkey 's most important trading partner and last year , german exports to turkey increased more than 25 percent , according to güler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes benz sells well in the middle east cars , machines and it products , traditionally strong markets worldwide for germany are in demand in turkey , said güler .
more important , perhaps , is the access turkey can provide german companies to the surrounding middle eastern regions . " german business has a large interest in using turkey as an opening into these other markets , " said güler , who is currently in ankara with schröder .
the head of the german industry association , a proponent of turkey 's eu drive , is planning a trip to discuss business ties in april . democratic reforms tied to economic success in exchange , turkey is looking for german help in convicing the european commission in december that it is ready to start eu membership negotiations .
until now , the eu has supported turkey 's reform drive but says there are still major problems in the areas of human rights and freedom of religion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , right , and german chancellor gerhard schroeder listen to their nations ' anthems during a welcoming ceremony for schroeder in ankara on monday , feb .

-lrb- ap photo / burhan ozbilici -rrb- schröder has said that a negotiation date will give turkey the necessary resolve to complete further reforms , something that is crucial for bilateral trade ties as well . turkey is aiming for membership some time in 2015 . " turkey can only be a strong business partner if it elevates its democracy to eu standards , " güler said . the european union 's expansion this may into eastern europe and the mediterranean may serve as a testing ground for gauging the viability of turkey 's membership , according to the head of the german trade union federation . anti-membership politicians from the german conservative opposition may repeat arguments over cheap labor flooding european markets and investment competition . but union chief michael sommer is convinced of the long-term benefits .
" there will be difficulties at the beginning , " sommer said . " but it will be good in the long term for german companies and workers , because there will be new markets .

unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.02.2004 german chancellor will support ankara in eu drive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this way to the eu , please : erdogan and schröder german chancellor gerhard schröder began talks monday morning with turkish leader tayyip erdogan in ankara .
unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .
he 's expected to make clear to schröder what he expects in return . rainer sollich -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

putting their signatures to the founding charter of a united european greens party in rome , delegates from 32 countries formalized the creation of the first europe-wide political party on sunday . in a historic first , green parties from across europe united under the banner of a new european green party at a two-day pre-election congress in rome . the event , rich in symbolism as it takes place in the birthplace of the european union , was opened on friday by german foreign minister joschka fischer , a prominent member of europe 's strongest green party . delegates , which included the heads of 32 green parties from the 15 member states of the european union as well as the 10 future members who will join on may 1 , launched a regional manifesto at the meeting .
as a result , the united greens will be the only party fighting the european election on a common manifesto . " european-izing the greens ' campaign " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the move marks a significant move forward for the greens , according to daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , co-president of the greens in the european parliament .
" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .
" we 're now launching an integrated poll campaign .
we 've found a common political form of expression .
we now have a common agency and we 'll intertwine our campaign appearances , " he said .

unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .

unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .
he 's expected to make clear to schröder what he expects in return . rainer sollich -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

in january , 10,000 social democrats handed back their membership cards for chancellor gerhard schröder 's party .
inner-party dissent has been apparent since the spd-led governing coalition initiated the chancellor 's " agenda 2010 " package of controversial measures to reform the country 's social , healthcare and pension systems .
but schröder 's resignation as party head in mid-february may have put an end to the flight from the party .
spd deputy leader kurt beck told the bild am sonntag newspaper over the weekend he had sensed an improvement in the atmosphere among party members since franz müntefering , currently head of the spd parliamentary group , was nominated spd chief .

putting their signatures to the founding charter of a united european greens party in rome , delegates from 32 countries formalized the creation of the first europe-wide political party on sunday . in a historic first , green parties from across europe united under the banner of a new european green party at a two-day pre-election congress in rome . the event , rich in symbolism as it takes place in the birthplace of the european union , was opened on friday by german foreign minister joschka fischer , a prominent member of europe 's strongest green party . delegates , which included the heads of 32 green parties from the 15 member states of the european union as well as the 10 future members who will join on may 1 , launched a regional manifesto at the meeting .
as a result , the united greens will be the only party fighting the european election on a common manifesto . " european-izing the greens ' campaign " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the move marks a significant move forward for the greens , according to daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , co-president of the greens in the european parliament .
" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .
" we 're now launching an integrated poll campaign .
we 've found a common political form of expression .
we now have a common agency and we 'll intertwine our campaign appearances , " he said .
for instance , joschka fischer will not just campaign in germany , but also in neighboring countries for the european elections . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china nuclear deal threatens to split german coalition the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .

" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .
" we 're now launching an integrated poll campaign .
we 've found a common political form of expression .
we now have a common agency and we 'll intertwine our campaign appearances , " he said .

" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution .

austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .

in the 19th century , germans helped build the baghdad railway connecting turkey to iraq .
turkey remains an important trading partner today and german businessmen are eager to tap into the market of the future . one of the stops on chancellor gerhard schröder 's brief trip through turkey on monday will be an enormous coal power plant near the syrian border .
for the past three months the steag plant has been supplying turkey with 8 percent of its energy .
steag is a daughter company of germany 's coal and chemical producer rag and the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- invested in the plant is the single biggest german investment in turkey . but it is by far not the only one .
the mediterranean country is not only politically interesting for germany , but holds great economic potential as well .
fifteen top managers , from companies such as basf , thyssenkrupp and the deutsche bahn are accompanying chancellor schröder during his visit .
there are already more than 1,000 turkish-german companies in turkey , making up 40 percent of all foreign investment in the country , according to the german industry association . with deutsche bank to baghdad " this is a market of the future , and germany needs to find other markets at the moment , " ahmet güler , of the alliance of european-turkish entrepreneurs association , told dw-world .
" china and turkey are growth markets . " germany and turkey already have historic economic ties dating back to the mid-19th century .
in 1888 , at the encouragement of german military men training the ottoman army , deutsche bank headed a consortium that won the bid to build the baghdad railway which connected europe to asia minor and the middle east . today , germany is turkey 's most important trading partner and last year , german exports to turkey increased more than 25 percent , according to güler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes benz sells well in the middle east cars , machines and it products , traditionally strong markets worldwide for germany are in demand in turkey , said güler .
more important , perhaps , is the access turkey can provide german companies to the surrounding middle eastern regions . " german business has a large interest in using turkey as an opening into these other markets , " said güler , who is currently in ankara with schröder .
the head of the german industry association , a proponent of turkey 's eu drive , is planning a trip to discuss business ties in april . democratic reforms tied to economic success in exchange , turkey is looking for german help in convicing the european commission in december that it is ready to start eu membership negotiations .
until now , the eu has supported turkey 's reform drive but says there are still major problems in the areas of human rights and freedom of religion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , right , and german chancellor gerhard schroeder listen to their nations ' anthems during a welcoming ceremony for schroeder in ankara on monday , feb .

-lrb- ap photo / burhan ozbilici -rrb- schröder has said that a negotiation date will give turkey the necessary resolve to complete further reforms , something that is crucial for bilateral trade ties as well . turkey is aiming for membership some time in 2015 . " turkey can only be a strong business partner if it elevates its democracy to eu standards , " güler said . the european union 's expansion this may into eastern europe and the mediterranean may serve as a testing ground for gauging the viability of turkey 's membership , according to the head of the german trade union federation . anti-membership politicians from the german conservative opposition may repeat arguments over cheap labor flooding european markets and investment competition . but union chief michael sommer is convinced of the long-term benefits .
" there will be difficulties at the beginning , " sommer said . " but it will be good in the long term for german companies and workers , because there will be new markets .

in the 19th century , germans helped build the baghdad railway connecting turkey to iraq .
turkey remains an important trading partner today and german businessmen are eager to tap into the market of the future . one of the stops on chancellor gerhard schröder 's brief trip through turkey on monday will be an enormous coal power plant near the syrian border .
for the past three months the steag plant has been supplying turkey with 8 percent of its energy .
steag is a daughter company of germany 's coal and chemical producer rag and the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- invested in the plant is the single biggest german investment in turkey . but it is by far not the only one .
the mediterranean country is not only politically interesting for germany , but holds great economic potential as well .
fifteen top managers , from companies such as basf , thyssenkrupp and the deutsche bahn are accompanying chancellor schröder during his visit .
there are already more than 1,000 turkish-german companies in turkey , making up 40 percent of all foreign investment in the country , according to the german industry association . with deutsche bank to baghdad " this is a market of the future , and germany needs to find other markets at the moment , " ahmet güler , of the alliance of european-turkish entrepreneurs association , told dw-world .
" china and turkey are growth markets . " germany and turkey already have historic economic ties dating back to the mid-19th century .
in 1888 , at the encouragement of german military men training the ottoman army , deutsche bank headed a consortium that won the bid to build the baghdad railway which connected europe to asia minor and the middle east . today , germany is turkey 's most important trading partner and last year , german exports to turkey increased more than 25 percent , according to güler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes benz sells well in the middle east cars , machines and it products , traditionally strong markets worldwide for germany are in demand in turkey , said güler .
more important , perhaps , is the access turkey can provide german companies to the surrounding middle eastern regions . " german business has a large interest in using turkey as an opening into these other markets , " said güler , who is currently in ankara with schröder .
the head of the german industry association , a proponent of turkey 's eu drive , is planning a trip to discuss business ties in april . democratic reforms tied to economic success in exchange , turkey is looking for german help in convicing the european commission in december that it is ready to start eu membership negotiations .
until now , the eu has supported turkey 's reform drive but says there are still major problems in the areas of human rights and freedom of religion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , right , and german chancellor gerhard schroeder listen to their nations ' anthems during a welcoming ceremony for schroeder in ankara on monday , feb .
23 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / burhan ozbilici -rrb- schröder has said that a negotiation date will give turkey the necessary resolve to complete further reforms , something that is crucial for bilateral trade ties as well . turkey is aiming for membership some time in 2015 . " turkey can only be a strong business partner if it elevates its democracy to eu standards , " güler said . the european union 's expansion this may into eastern europe and the mediterranean may serve as a testing ground for gauging the viability of turkey 's membership , according to the head of the german trade union federation . anti-membership politicians from the german conservative opposition may repeat arguments over cheap labor flooding european markets and investment competition . but union chief michael sommer is convinced of the long-term benefits .
" there will be difficulties at the beginning , " sommer said . " but it will be good in the long term for german companies and workers , because there will be new markets . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german chancellor will support ankara in eu drive german chancellor gerhard schröder began talks monday morning with turkish leader tayyip erdogan in ankara .
unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.02.2004 european greens found european greens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a level playing field for europe 's greens .
putting their signatures to the founding charter of a united european greens party in rome , delegates from 32 countries formalized the creation of the first europe-wide political party on sunday . in a historic first , green parties from across europe united under the banner of a new european green party at a two-day pre-election congress in rome . the event , rich in symbolism as it takes place in the birthplace of the european union , was opened on friday by german foreign minister joschka fischer , a prominent member of europe 's strongest green party . delegates , which included the heads of 32 green parties from the 15 member states of the european union as well as the 10 future members who will join on may 1 , launched a regional manifesto at the meeting .
as a result , the united greens will be the only party fighting the european election on a common manifesto . " european-izing the greens ' campaign " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the move marks a significant move forward for the greens , according to daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , co-president of the greens in the european parliament .
" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .
" we 're now launching an integrated poll campaign .
we 've found a common political form of expression .
we now have a common agency and we 'll intertwine our campaign appearances , " he said .
for instance , joschka fischer will not just campaign in germany , but also in neighboring countries for the european elections . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china nuclear deal threatens to split german coalition the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .

in the 19th century , germans helped build the baghdad railway connecting turkey to iraq .
turkey remains an important trading partner today and german businessmen are eager to tap into the market of the future . one of the stops on chancellor gerhard schröder 's brief trip through turkey on monday will be an enormous coal power plant near the syrian border .
for the past three months the steag plant has been supplying turkey with 8 percent of its energy .
steag is a daughter company of germany 's coal and chemical producer rag and the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- invested in the plant is the single biggest german investment in turkey . but it is by far not the only one .
the mediterranean country is not only politically interesting for germany , but holds great economic potential as well .
fifteen top managers , from companies such as basf , thyssenkrupp and the deutsche bahn are accompanying chancellor schröder during his visit .
there are already more than 1,000 turkish-german companies in turkey , making up 40 percent of all foreign investment in the country , according to the german industry association . with deutsche bank to baghdad " this is a market of the future , and germany needs to find other markets at the moment , " ahmet güler , of the alliance of european-turkish entrepreneurs association , told dw-world .
" china and turkey are growth markets . " germany and turkey already have historic economic ties dating back to the mid-19th century .
in 1888 , at the encouragement of german military men training the ottoman army , deutsche bank headed a consortium that won the bid to build the baghdad railway which connected europe to asia minor and the middle east . today , germany is turkey 's most important trading partner and last year , german exports to turkey increased more than 25 percent , according to güler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes benz sells well in the middle east cars , machines and it products , traditionally strong markets worldwide for germany are in demand in turkey , said güler .
more important , perhaps , is the access turkey can provide german companies to the surrounding middle eastern regions . " german business has a large interest in using turkey as an opening into these other markets , " said güler , who is currently in ankara with schröder .
the head of the german industry association , a proponent of turkey 's eu drive , is planning a trip to discuss business ties in april . democratic reforms tied to economic success in exchange , turkey is looking for german help in convicing the european commission in december that it is ready to start eu membership negotiations .
until now , the eu has supported turkey 's reform drive but says there are still major problems in the areas of human rights and freedom of religion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , right , and german chancellor gerhard schroeder listen to their nations ' anthems during a welcoming ceremony for schroeder in ankara on monday , feb .

-lrb- ap photo / burhan ozbilici -rrb- schröder has said that a negotiation date will give turkey the necessary resolve to complete further reforms , something that is crucial for bilateral trade ties as well . turkey is aiming for membership some time in 2015 . " turkey can only be a strong business partner if it elevates its democracy to eu standards , " güler said . the european union 's expansion this may into eastern europe and the mediterranean may serve as a testing ground for gauging the viability of turkey 's membership , according to the head of the german trade union federation . anti-membership politicians from the german conservative opposition may repeat arguments over cheap labor flooding european markets and investment competition . but union chief michael sommer is convinced of the long-term benefits .
" there will be difficulties at the beginning , " sommer said . " but it will be good in the long term for german companies and workers , because there will be new markets .

putting their signatures to the founding charter of a united european greens party in rome , delegates from 32 countries formalized the creation of the first europe-wide political party on sunday . in a historic first , green parties from across europe united under the banner of a new european green party at a two-day pre-election congress in rome . the event , rich in symbolism as it takes place in the birthplace of the european union , was opened on friday by german foreign minister joschka fischer , a prominent member of europe 's strongest green party . delegates , which included the heads of 32 green parties from the 15 member states of the european union as well as the 10 future members who will join on may 1 , launched a regional manifesto at the meeting .
as a result , the united greens will be the only party fighting the european election on a common manifesto . " european-izing the greens ' campaign " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the move marks a significant move forward for the greens , according to daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , co-president of the greens in the european parliament .
" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .
" we 're now launching an integrated poll campaign .
we 've found a common political form of expression .
we now have a common agency and we 'll intertwine our campaign appearances , " he said .
for instance , joschka fischer will not just campaign in germany , but also in neighboring countries for the european elections . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china nuclear deal threatens to split german coalition the government has denied reports that plans to sell a plutonium plant to china have caused a rift between the chancellor and his foreign minister .

in the 19th century , germans helped build the baghdad railway connecting turkey to iraq .
turkey remains an important trading partner today and german businessmen are eager to tap into the market of the future . one of the stops on chancellor gerhard schröder 's brief trip through turkey on monday will be an enormous coal power plant near the syrian border .
for the past three months the steag plant has been supplying turkey with 8 percent of its energy .
steag is a daughter company of germany 's coal and chemical producer rag and the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- invested in the plant is the single biggest german investment in turkey . but it is by far not the only one .
the mediterranean country is not only politically interesting for germany , but holds great economic potential as well .
fifteen top managers , from companies such as basf , thyssenkrupp and the deutsche bahn are accompanying chancellor schröder during his visit .
there are already more than 1,000 turkish-german companies in turkey , making up 40 percent of all foreign investment in the country , according to the german industry association . with deutsche bank to baghdad " this is a market of the future , and germany needs to find other markets at the moment , " ahmet güler , of the alliance of european-turkish entrepreneurs association , told dw-world .

unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .

kpn chief ad scheepbouwer suggested that mmo2 could be subjected to a hostile takeover by kpn , a statement which he later took back .

unlike the german opposition , schröder wants to give the country hope for the eu . german chancellor gerhard schröder was unequivocal in his support for turkey 's efforts to join the european union upon his arrival in ankara sunday evening . " one needs to deal fairly with turkey and fair means that you stand by your word , " schröder said . " i stand by my word . " the german leader 's pro-ankara stance is diametrically opposed to that of german conservative opposition leader angela merkel . on a visit to the turkish capital last week , merkel talked about a " privileged partnership " rather than full eu membership . her host seemed everything but pleased .
" that 's not been talked about so far and we certainly do n't plan on considering it , " turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with ecumenical orthodox patriarch bartholomew i at the patriarchate in istanbul during her visit to turkey last week .
merkel 's suggestion is not without reason , however .
she believes the eu , which will add 10 new member states in may , would not be able to handle the challenge to integrate turkey with its population of 70 million and an economic power that only amounts to 23 percent of the eu average . that 's why turkey should not become an eu member and instead be rewarded for its reform efforts with a close relationship to the union , according to merkel . a fair chance at best , that 's a weak consolation prize from turkey 's point of view .
the german chancellor knows this : his coalition government of social democrats and greens therefore demands to give turkey a fair chance during the eu application process . unlike conservative european political circles , the german government has n't seen turkey 's islamic cultural imprint as a hindrance to eu membership .
instead , the government sees the country 's inclusion in the union as a chance for dialogue between cultures and a possible example for the successful democratization within the islamic world . while a possible membership is still years away , schröder believes the union needs to keep its promise to initiate accession talks should turkey manage to fulfil the criteria . since the association treaty of 1963 , turkey 's been told that the process of rapprochement includes the possibility of a future eu membership , the chancellor said .
" the expectations raised by this can not and may not be disappointed , " schröder added . will germany open the door to eu membership ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
turkey on the other hand views germany as the country that can open the door to eu membership .
reasons for that include the 2.5 million turkish people now living in germany as a result of so-called guest worker recruitment since the 1960s . the two countries also have historical ties : they were allies during world war i and ankara granted asylum to german scientists persecuted during the nazi dictatorship .
the scientists in turn helped turkey to set up a modern university system . but erdogan wo n't need to remind schröder of this .
he 's got better arguments to convince the chancellor to push for the initiation of membership talks at the end of the year .
the turkish leader and his reform-oriented islamic party have managed to introduce reforms such as the abolishment of the death penalty previous western oriented turkish governments failed to secure . even human rights organization amnesty international now talks of significant progress even though problems implementing the reforms still exist .
erdogan has another trump card as well : he 's backed efforts to reach a solution in cyprus , where reunification talks ahead of the country 's eu membership in may are under way .
he 's expected to make clear to schröder what he expects in return . rainer sollich -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

putting their signatures to the founding charter of a united european greens party in rome , delegates from 32 countries formalized the creation of the first europe-wide political party on sunday . in a historic first , green parties from across europe united under the banner of a new european green party at a two-day pre-election congress in rome . the event , rich in symbolism as it takes place in the birthplace of the european union , was opened on friday by german foreign minister joschka fischer , a prominent member of europe 's strongest green party . delegates , which included the heads of 32 green parties from the 15 member states of the european union as well as the 10 future members who will join on may 1 , launched a regional manifesto at the meeting .
as a result , the united greens will be the only party fighting the european election on a common manifesto . " european-izing the greens ' campaign " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the move marks a significant move forward for the greens , according to daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , co-president of the greens in the european parliament .
" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .
" we 're now launching an integrated poll campaign .
we 've found a common political form of expression .
we now have a common agency and we 'll intertwine our campaign appearances , " he said .

putting their signatures to the founding charter of a united european greens party in rome , delegates from 32 countries formalized the creation of the first europe-wide political party on sunday . in a historic first , green parties from across europe united under the banner of a new european green party at a two-day pre-election congress in rome . the event , rich in symbolism as it takes place in the birthplace of the european union , was opened on friday by german foreign minister joschka fischer , a prominent member of europe 's strongest green party . delegates , which included the heads of 32 green parties from the 15 member states of the european union as well as the 10 future members who will join on may 1 , launched a regional manifesto at the meeting .
as a result , the united greens will be the only party fighting the european election on a common manifesto . " european-izing the greens ' campaign " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit the move marks a significant move forward for the greens , according to daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , co-president of the greens in the european parliament .
" we want to closely integrate our policies and positions in the future , " he told dw-world .
" it 's about european-izing the greens ' campaign without contradicting national cultures , " he added . the congress 's central task was to develop common political guidelines - a difficult undertaking as green parties in individual eu states have differing positions on controversial topics such as genetically-modified food , turkey 's eu bid and the floundering european constitution . " there are clear majorities as well as divergent positions .
for instance , the swedes or britons have a much critical take on the constitution , " cohn-bendit said .
" we need to openly discuss all that . " in its manifesto , the newly formed party now calls for the protection of the environment as well as finding peaceful solutions to conflicts .
the ratification of an eu constitution is another goal adopted at the congress . german greens lead the way the congress was expected to be dominated by germany 's green party given its influential position in europe . the greens first entered into a coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in 1998 .
they were re-elected with their best-ever results of 8.6 percent of the vote in the 2002 national polls , reinforcing their standing as europe 's only green party to be an active member of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party members in the past five years , the party has pushed a green agenda in german politics - though some of it has been marked by compromise - from a debate on the mobilization of german troops in the balkans and afghanistan , the transport of nuclear waste , setting a timetable for germany 's nuclear phase-out and more recently , a more socially-fair slant to the country 's social and labor reforms . not much support from european counterparts few other green parties in europe come close to the german greens ' record . green parties in france , belgium and finland have all been forced out of the ruling coalition .
the situation is no better in scandinavia .
the only hope is austria , where the greens still carry weight in mainstream politics .
austria 's greens took 9.47 percent of the vote and 17 parliamentary seats in the 2002 election . a look at the green record in the ten largely former communist states in eastern europe , which will join the bloc in may , makes it obvious that the greens will find it tough to reassert their position as the fifth-strongest force in european elections on june 13 , 2004 . greens have just 2.4 percent support in the czech republic , are a marginal force in poland , the biggest new member , and are almost non-existent in the other new states . but cohn-bendit is optimistic that a pooling of the various national parties at a european level will strengthen the green hand .

in the 19th century , germans helped build the baghdad railway connecting turkey to iraq .
turkey remains an important trading partner today and german businessmen are eager to tap into the market of the future . one of the stops on chancellor gerhard schröder 's brief trip through turkey on monday will be an enormous coal power plant near the syrian border .
for the past three months the steag plant has been supplying turkey with 8 percent of its energy .
steag is a daughter company of germany 's coal and chemical producer rag and the € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- invested in the plant is the single biggest german investment in turkey . but it is by far not the only one .
the mediterranean country is not only politically interesting for germany , but holds great economic potential as well .
fifteen top managers , from companies such as basf , thyssenkrupp and the deutsche bahn are accompanying chancellor schröder during his visit .
there are already more than 1,000 turkish-german companies in turkey , making up 40 percent of all foreign investment in the country , according to the german industry association . with deutsche bank to baghdad " this is a market of the future , and germany needs to find other markets at the moment , " ahmet güler , of the alliance of european-turkish entrepreneurs association , told dw-world .
" china and turkey are growth markets . " germany and turkey already have historic economic ties dating back to the mid-19th century .
in 1888 , at the encouragement of german military men training the ottoman army , deutsche bank headed a consortium that won the bid to build the baghdad railway which connected europe to asia minor and the middle east . today , germany is turkey 's most important trading partner and last year , german exports to turkey increased more than 25 percent , according to güler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes benz sells well in the middle east cars , machines and it products , traditionally strong markets worldwide for germany are in demand in turkey , said güler .
more important , perhaps , is the access turkey can provide german companies to the surrounding middle eastern regions . " german business has a large interest in using turkey as an opening into these other markets , " said güler , who is currently in ankara with schröder .
the head of the german industry association , a proponent of turkey 's eu drive , is planning a trip to discuss business ties in april . democratic reforms tied to economic success in exchange , turkey is looking for german help in convicing the european commission in december that it is ready to start eu membership negotiations .
until now , the eu has supported turkey 's reform drive but says there are still major problems in the areas of human rights and freedom of religion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , right , and german chancellor gerhard schroeder listen to their nations ' anthems during a welcoming ceremony for schroeder in ankara on monday , feb .

-lrb- ap photo / burhan ozbilici -rrb- schröder has said that a negotiation date will give turkey the necessary resolve to complete further reforms , something that is crucial for bilateral trade ties as well . turkey is aiming for membership some time in 2015 . " turkey can only be a strong business partner if it elevates its democracy to eu standards , " güler said . the european union 's expansion this may into eastern europe and the mediterranean may serve as a testing ground for gauging the viability of turkey 's membership , according to the head of the german trade union federation . anti-membership politicians from the german conservative opposition may repeat arguments over cheap labor flooding european markets and investment competition . but union chief michael sommer is convinced of the long-term benefits .
" there will be difficulties at the beginning , " sommer said . " but it will be good in the long term for german companies and workers , because there will be new markets .

international consulting firm bearingpoint announced in mid-february setting up a software centre in madras which within a couple of years will house 3,000 staff .

in effect , it means the people at the sharp end of a particular project can get on with managing it and earning the big bucks - leaving their indian colleagues to provide the back-end programming muscle at far lower cost than doing the job in the same location as the project itself .

trouble in store ?
all is not entirely rosy , however .
the huge weight of india 's agricultural sector is a concern .
with much of it still based on subsistence , india 's opposition to opening farming to imports - and its consequent leading role in opposing fresh trade talks without significant concessions from the richer nations - comes as little surprise .
the boom has yet to make much of a dent in a public deficit that s & p , for one , fears is too high for comfort at about 9 % of gdp .
privatisation plans designed to ease public spending have generally run into the sand - partly because of opposition from the more strident nationalists in the bjp-led coalition .

so prime minister atal behari vajpayee 's decision to send india to the polls this april should come as little surprise .
after a tough few years , borne of droughts which ravaged the country 's massive agricultural sector and confronted many of its billion-strong population with the risk of famine , things look to be on track .
the latest figures show economic growth to be topping 8 % , a rate only matched by the powerhouse that is china .
the expansion not only embraces farming - back to solid growth thanks to the best monsoon season for a decade .
industry is booming , as december 's 6.2 % year-on-year growth showed .
and the burgeoning services business is doing well too .
change of strategy for once , then , the hindu nationalist coalition over which mr vajpayee presides might be able to pull off a win without having to put religion at the centre of its campaign .
the government itself talks of a " feel-good " factor on which it hopes to base victory .
an advertising blitz is filling hoardings and tv screens with the message : " india shining " .
a mini-budget before parliament was dissolved in early february made only a few modest tax concessions , a far cry from the more usual giveaway seen as necessary to win the economic vote .
even international credit rating agency standard & poor 's - never the greatest friend of india 's once socialist economy - gave it good reviews .
fancy shopping malls cater to newly-enriched consumers " while -lrb- the budget 's -rrb- projections are based on expectations of 8 % gdp growth , " s & p analyst ping chew wrote , " it is a positive sign that the looming general election has not led to a significant loosening in fiscal policy . "
in other words , things are good enough that the government does not think it needs a wholesale giveaway to win votes .
buy , buy , buy but where is this new-found boom coming from ?
and just how deep into this massive country , a majority of whose population still live off less than a dollar a day , does the prosperity penetrate ?
on the surface , certainly things have changed radically .
most big indian cities can now boast shining shopping malls , the shelves groaning under consumer goods sourced from companies both at home and abroad .
familiar international brand names - in sportswear , clothing , beauty , electronics - are everywhere .
a far cry indeed from the days little more than a decade or so ago , when it took half a decade to get a phone line , or when every second car on the roads was a locally built , boxy ambassador .
as many as 300 million people now count as middle class in india , and although wages are way below their western counterparts , the difference in purchasing power means standards of living are shooting up .
in another very modern symbol of development , there are now 30 million mobile phones in india - a figure which is confidently expected to triple within a year or so .
learn to win with indian higher education turning out 2.3 million graduates fluent in english every year -lrb- twice as many as the us produces -rrb- , the effects of india 's economic revival are being felt overseas .
combined with the relatively low cost , the upsurge in highly-qualified personpower is creating a sweet spot that many employers in europe and the us are trying to exploit .
the most high-profile - and controversial - are probably the call centres , which are rapidly hollowing out large chunks of the business .
call centres are one growth industry but professional jobs are fleeing offshore too , with indian computer programmers in particular in high demand .
international consulting firm bearingpoint announced in mid-february setting up a software centre in madras which within a couple of years will house 3,000 staff .
their work , and that of a 2,000-strong centre in shanghai , will underpin the company 's efforts worldwide , according executive vice-president john condon .

since moving to the us , the 26-year-old has starred in several major movies .
woody allen sought her out to play the mute hattie in sweet and lowdown , and steven spielberg cast her opposite tom cruise in minority report .
now morton 's performance in in america has earned the nottingham-born star her first best actress oscar nomination .
in america morton , who moved to the united states at the age of 19 , feels " embraced " by her adopted country .
" sometimes you need to come over here -lrb- america -rrb- to get someone to believe in you , " morton told tom brook on bbc news 24 's hardtalk .
" i think in the uk sometimes there 's a lack of that . "
morton , who spent a troubled childhood in foster care , found it difficult to move forward in the uk .
morton is set to star opposite johnny depp in the libertine " i used to feel an outsider in britain , " she said , " but that was very much a chip on my shoulder .
" you have to say to yourself : ' i have these opportunities and i 'm going to run with them ' , and not feel disadvantaged because my mum and dad were n't in the theatre industry or whatever , " she continued .
fame game her most recent film , in america , is based on director jim sheridan 's own life story about his family emigrating from ireland to new york .
yet despite oscar nominations , the film - and morton - were ignored at this year 's bafta awards .
" you can never underestimate the power of celebrity , " says morton .
" you either get hyped for being the new thing or for being established . "
" the industry is based on celebrity , it 's not just about how good you are .
i 'm very lucky my work 's been consistent - 95 % of actors are out of work no matter how brilliant they might be , " she added .
i want to play women as opposed to young tormented teenagers samantha morton while she is realistic about the fame game , morton has no time for the british penchant for celebrity-bashing .
" in the uk , instead of celebrating something , there is a desire to knock it or find an angle that 's salacious - i find it quite boring , but we have a society now that thrives on that . "
chess pawn morton , who has a reputation for eccentricity , admits she can be difficult to work with because she is a perfectionist .
in her view , it is ultimately the director 's job to exert control on a film set .
" it is n't really about me , i 'm a pawn in a big game of chess - not that i do n't have any self-preservation or self-worth but i do feel it 's a bit bigger than just my opinion . "
with two oscar nominations behind her , the 26-year-old star hopes to be offered a wider range of roles in the future .
" i 'm a woman , i 'm nearly 27 and a mother and i want to play women as opposed to young tormented teenagers . "
upcoming films include an adaptation of ian mcewan 's enduring love and the libertine opposite johnny depp .
passionate and committed , one gets the feeling it wo n't be long before morton is gracing the red carpet once again .
this interview by tom brook will be broadcast on the hardtalk programme on tuesday 24 february at 0430 gmt and is repeated at 2330 gmt .

morton , who spent a troubled childhood in foster care , found it difficult to move forward in the uk .
morton is set to star opposite johnny depp in the libertine " i used to feel an outsider in britain , " she said , " but that was very much a chip on my shoulder .
" you have to say to yourself : ' i have these opportunities and i 'm going to run with them ' , and not feel disadvantaged because my mum and dad were n't in the theatre industry or whatever , " she continued .
fame game her most recent film , in america , is based on director jim sheridan 's own life story about his family emigrating from ireland to new york .
yet despite oscar nominations , the film - and morton - were ignored at this year 's bafta awards .
" you can never underestimate the power of celebrity , " says morton .
" you either get hyped for being the new thing or for being established . "
" the industry is based on celebrity , it 's not just about how good you are .
i 'm very lucky my work 's been consistent - 95 % of actors are out of work no matter how brilliant they might be , " she added .
i want to play women as opposed to young tormented teenagers samantha morton while she is realistic about the fame game , morton has no time for the british penchant for celebrity-bashing .
" in the uk , instead of celebrating something , there is a desire to knock it or find an angle that 's salacious - i find it quite boring , but we have a society now that thrives on that . "
chess pawn morton , who has a reputation for eccentricity , admits she can be difficult to work with because she is a perfectionist .
in her view , it is ultimately the director 's job to exert control on a film set .
" it is n't really about me , i 'm a pawn in a big game of chess - not that i do n't have any self-preservation or self-worth but i do feel it 's a bit bigger than just my opinion . "
with two oscar nominations behind her , the 26-year-old star hopes to be offered a wider range of roles in the future .
" i 'm a woman , i 'm nearly 27 and a mother and i want to play women as opposed to young tormented teenagers . "
upcoming films include an adaptation of ian mcewan 's enduring love and the libertine opposite johnny depp .
passionate and committed , one gets the feeling it wo n't be long before morton is gracing the red carpet once again .
this interview by tom brook will be broadcast on the hardtalk programme on tuesday 24 february at 0430 gmt and is repeated at 2330 gmt .

us-based citigroup edged out standard chartered , which has a 10 % stake in the south korean lender .
many lenders are moving into so-called developing markets as demand is expected to increase and growth rates are higher than in the us and europe .
citigroup already has operations in countries such as poland and mexico .
top of list " korea is a strategic priority for citigroup , " said deryck maughan , chairman and chief executive of citigroup .
the purchase of koram bank will put citigroup ahead of rivals standard chartered and hsbc in south korea , which is asia 's fourth-largest economy and its third-biggest banking market .
citigroup offered 15,000 won -lrb- £ 6.83 , $ 12.71 -rrb- for each koram bank share , about 7 % more than the average price over the past month .
the bid was high enough to convince a consortium led by the carlyle group , the private investment concern , to sell its 37 % stake .
early effects citigroup said it hoped to secure more than 80 % of koram , including standard chartered 's holding .
although the boards of both lenders have agreed the deal and will recommend it to shareholders , the purchase agreement still needs regulatory approval .
both banks , however , said they were confident that the deal would go through in the second quarter of this year .
koram bank has more than 6 million clients and 222 domestic branches .
together with citigroup , the companies will form south korea 's fifth-largest bank .

i came into contact with a lot of drugs through the building trade - it 's a tough life out there in all weathers and drugs are an escape .
i was earning good money working as a builder and dealing in drugs , but it got to the point where i was taking 10 to 15 tabs a night and my head was mashed all the time .
the first time i stopped taking cocaine , i realised i had an alcohol problem too .
when you 're on coke you can drink a lot without getting drunk , and i was becoming very aggressive , starting to lose weight and look bad .
the lowest point was when i woke up sprawled on the street near leicester square and people were walking over me to get to work chris coughlan i eventually stopped working and ended up homeless around the west end .
it was a bit exciting at first - no rules , do what you want .
i used to think homeless people were scum , but once you get into that trap , it 's very hard to get out .
the lowest point was when i woke up sprawled on the street near leicester square and people were walking over me to get to work .
one christmas , when i was squatting in the east end , i went to a crisis homeless centre in whitechapel , where i met a tea lady who started to give me the gospel .
she was the first person i was ever honest with .
later , as i was contemplating suicide one night , i looked down and saw the bible she 'd given me and i prayed to god " get me out of this mess i 'm in " .
so i decided " i 'm gonna give this a go " .
at first i was suspicious of teen challenge - you read about these cults - but that passed after two weeks .
they get you up at 7.15am and keep you active .
you 've got people encouraging you and you 're not dwelling on stuff .
i needed the discipline .
you do n't have to be a christian to get help from them , you just need to be open to it .
i 've seen guys come through the programme without finding god .
but coming off drugs is easy , it 's staying off drugs that 's the hard part , and to do that you need to sort your heart out .
' toughening the law ' the growth in drugs in the last five years has been 100 times what it was when i was in it .
i go to my local park in ilford and see 10 and 11-year-olds smoking joints .
there 's no way i would have come into contact with drugs when i was growing up in tottenham .
i feel sorry for people living on the estates .
i did n't realise how big a problem it was until i came to teen challenge .
the downgrading of cannabis to class c is a massive shame .
it sends a bad message out to young people .
a lot of it is much stronger nowadays , and i 've seen guys of 18 to 21 who 've smoked since they were very young and are now accessing mental health services .
cannabis leads to stronger drugs , so the change angers me a bit .

the troubled group , which is 79 % owned by insurer prudential , said its annual pre-tax losses for 2003 had risen to £ 34.4m -lrb- $ 64.8m -rrb- , up from £ 16.6m in 2002 .
egg said it made an operating profit of £ 72.8m in the uk , however that figure was overshadowed by an operating loss of £ 89.1m in france .
prudential has signalled its intention to sell the internet bank .
the uk insurance giant said in january that it had several potential buyers for egg .
target put back egg chief executive paul gratton said : " in france , as previously reported , the underlying business performance has been very disappointing . "
the company has struggled since the launch of its la carte egg credit card in 2002 , following the purchase of french internet bank zebank .
