german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .
but klinsmann , who says several questions about money and personnel still need to be addressed , cautioned about jumping too quickly to a decision .
" even though all of germany is waiting for a decision , people just have to be patient .
the world cup 2006 is the biggest sporting event , and the chance wo n't come again for germany in the next 30 , 40 years .
therefore we have to look at everything very carefully , " klinsmann said .
" i will not allow myself to be pressured into something .

as the saga continues , many explanations for the job 's current pariah status have been offered .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .

nato took command of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- last summer .
it currently has some 6,500 troops in afghanistan , of which the largest contingent is supplied by germany with some 1,900 soldiers .
last october the alliance agreed to expand the peacekeeping force beyond the capital .
but , apart from germany , which sent 240 soldiers to the northern city of kunduz , nato has been unable to persuade governments of the need to provide more troops outside kabul .
afghan president hamid karzai has appealed to nato leaders to send more soldiers as quickly as possible , as violence continues to threaten the security of the country .
back at their june summit , the allies committed themselves to increasing troop levels to 10,000 , but have struggled coming up with the soldiers as long as the region continues to be a high-risk .
spain only recently pledged to increase its contingent in afghanistan from 140 to about 1,000 after it pulled its forces out of iraq .
in france , motivation has been low to increase the contingent above the current 540 troops .

us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .
peacekeeping mission continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldier in provisional reconstruction team patrols a street near taloqan in the kunduz region in feb .
2004 .
nato took command of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- last summer .
it currently has some 6,500 troops in afghanistan , of which the largest contingent is supplied by germany with some 1,900 soldiers .
last october the alliance agreed to expand the peacekeeping force beyond the capital .
but , apart from germany , which sent 240 soldiers to the northern city of kunduz , nato has been unable to persuade governments of the need to provide more troops outside kabul .
afghan president hamid karzai has appealed to nato leaders to send more soldiers as quickly as possible , as violence continues to threaten the security of the country .
back at their june summit , the allies committed themselves to increasing troop levels to 10,000 , but have struggled coming up with the soldiers as long as the region continues to be a high-risk .
spain only recently pledged to increase its contingent in afghanistan from 140 to about 1,000 after it pulled its forces out of iraq .
in france , motivation has been low to increase the contingent above the current 540 troops .
and in germany , which has troops in the balkans and the horn of africa , there is little readiness to send even more soldiers to afghanistan dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .

three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .

it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .
in this area , the government has only gone half way , he said .

in the interview westerwelle sought to play down the political consequences of coming out , a move der spiegel said could lead to a " clash of cultures " with the more traditional thinking of someone like edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union .
the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .
" the potential is definitely there , but i am not convinced that it is the right time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " floating home " design by architects förster trabitzsch .
whether the time is right or not , the pace of change is gathering momentum and the spree is being systematically primed for its new post as the glistening face of a truly modern city .
with art , glass houses , warehouse conversions , bars and beaches lining the river banks , and plans for canals and futuristic floating homes , the spree is finally getting the attention it lacked for so long . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love ’ s lost parade one of europe ’ s biggest electronic music scenes lost its biggest event this year , but that didn ’ t stop techno loyalists from turning out on saturday in berlin for some radically scaled back versions of the love parade .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .

just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .
a little over six meters wide and four and a half meters high , the banner had waved over one of the towers at the reichstag , germany 's parliament building for years until wolfgang thierse , president of the parliament , decided to sell it to help replenish state coffers .
feeling a strong sense of patriotism , christine schmittroth purchased the tricolor for € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,050 -rrb- and hung it up over her brothel in the town of halle , in eastern germany .
on " special occasions " visitors to her establishment would be reminded of the owner 's lover for her fatherland .
but that was simply too much for neighbors and other concerned citizens who saw the action as a disgrace to the country , and schmittroth felt obliged to auction off the flag to a more worthy owner . € 16,000 for new owner she turned to the german e-bay site and started watching the bids rise .
just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .
schmittroth says she will hand over the profits from the sale to a local children 's cancer fund .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .

in the interview westerwelle sought to play down the political consequences of coming out , a move der spiegel said could lead to a " clash of cultures " with the more traditional thinking of someone like edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union .
the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .
in this area , the government has only gone half way , he said .
clash of cultures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition party leaders : fdp , guido westerwelle , -lrb- left -rrb- ; cdu , angela merkel , -lrb- mid -rrb- ; and csu , edmund stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- .
in the interview westerwelle sought to play down the political consequences of coming out , a move der spiegel said could lead to a " clash of cultures " with the more traditional thinking of someone like edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union .
the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .
" the fdp will never back any political attempt to return society to the 1950s .
on the contrary , we want to achieve more progress , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de out is in among german politicians guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neoliberal free democratic party , has appeared in public with his boyfriend for the first time .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.07.2004 klinsmann ready to take charge of team germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new face of german soccer ?
german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .
" the potential is definitely there , but i am not convinced that it is the right time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " floating home " design by architects förster trabitzsch .
whether the time is right or not , the pace of change is gathering momentum and the spree is being systematically primed for its new post as the glistening face of a truly modern city .
with art , glass houses , warehouse conversions , bars and beaches lining the river banks , and plans for canals and futuristic floating homes , the spree is finally getting the attention it lacked for so long . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love ’ s lost parade one of europe ’ s biggest electronic music scenes lost its biggest event this year , but that didn ’ t stop techno loyalists from turning out on saturday in berlin for some radically scaled back versions of the love parade .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .
peacekeeping mission continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldier in provisional reconstruction team patrols a street near taloqan in the kunduz region in feb .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.07.2004 nato approves more troops for afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still more soldiers are needed .
after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .
peacekeeping mission continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldier in provisional reconstruction team patrols a street near taloqan in the kunduz region in feb .
2004 .
nato took command of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- last summer .
it currently has some 6,500 troops in afghanistan , of which the largest contingent is supplied by germany with some 1,900 soldiers .
last october the alliance agreed to expand the peacekeeping force beyond the capital .
but , apart from germany , which sent 240 soldiers to the northern city of kunduz , nato has been unable to persuade governments of the need to provide more troops outside kabul .
afghan president hamid karzai has appealed to nato leaders to send more soldiers as quickly as possible , as violence continues to threaten the security of the country .
back at their june summit , the allies committed themselves to increasing troop levels to 10,000 , but have struggled coming up with the soldiers as long as the region continues to be a high-risk .
spain only recently pledged to increase its contingent in afghanistan from 140 to about 1,000 after it pulled its forces out of iraq .
in france , motivation has been low to increase the contingent above the current 540 troops .
and in germany , which has troops in the balkans and the horn of africa , there is little readiness to send even more soldiers to afghanistan dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .

nato took command of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- last summer .
it currently has some 6,500 troops in afghanistan , of which the largest contingent is supplied by germany with some 1,900 soldiers .
last october the alliance agreed to expand the peacekeeping force beyond the capital .
but , apart from germany , which sent 240 soldiers to the northern city of kunduz , nato has been unable to persuade governments of the need to provide more troops outside kabul .
afghan president hamid karzai has appealed to nato leaders to send more soldiers as quickly as possible , as violence continues to threaten the security of the country .
back at their june summit , the allies committed themselves to increasing troop levels to 10,000 , but have struggled coming up with the soldiers as long as the region continues to be a high-risk .
spain only recently pledged to increase its contingent in afghanistan from 140 to about 1,000 after it pulled its forces out of iraq .
in france , motivation has been low to increase the contingent above the current 540 troops .
and in germany , which has troops in the balkans and the horn of africa , there is little readiness to send even more soldiers to afghanistan dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .
" the potential is definitely there , but i am not convinced that it is the right time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " floating home " design by architects förster trabitzsch .
whether the time is right or not , the pace of change is gathering momentum and the spree is being systematically primed for its new post as the glistening face of a truly modern city .
with art , glass houses , warehouse conversions , bars and beaches lining the river banks , and plans for canals and futuristic floating homes , the spree is finally getting the attention it lacked for so long . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love ’ s lost parade one of europe ’ s biggest electronic music scenes lost its biggest event this year , but that didn ’ t stop techno loyalists from turning out on saturday in berlin for some radically scaled back versions of the love parade .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .

but that was simply too much for neighbors and other concerned citizens who saw the action as a disgrace to the country , and schmittroth felt obliged to auction off the flag to a more worthy owner . € 16,000 for new owner she turned to the german e-bay site and started watching the bids rise .
just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .
schmittroth says she will hand over the profits from the sale to a local children 's cancer fund .
the new owner has n't said where the giant flag will fly next . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flag auction nets profit for bundestag what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .
in this area , the government has only gone half way , he said .
clash of cultures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition party leaders : fdp , guido westerwelle , -lrb- left -rrb- ; cdu , angela merkel , -lrb- mid -rrb- ; and csu , edmund stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- .
in the interview westerwelle sought to play down the political consequences of coming out , a move der spiegel said could lead to a " clash of cultures " with the more traditional thinking of someone like edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union .
the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .
" the fdp will never back any political attempt to return society to the 1950s .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .
aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . -lrb- july 23 , 2004 -rrb- jockeying for a seat talk over reforms have replaced the war in iraq as the issue du jour at the un in new york .

in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.07.2004 in berlin , a river remade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the molecule man sculpture has become a feature of the spree berlin 's river spree was long slighted by the city 's inhabitants , who saw it as little more than a murky cradle of industry .
now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .
" the potential is definitely there , but i am not convinced that it is the right time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " floating home " design by architects förster trabitzsch .
whether the time is right or not , the pace of change is gathering momentum and the spree is being systematically primed for its new post as the glistening face of a truly modern city .
with art , glass houses , warehouse conversions , bars and beaches lining the river banks , and plans for canals and futuristic floating homes , the spree is finally getting the attention it lacked for so long . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love ’ s lost parade one of europe ’ s biggest electronic music scenes lost its biggest event this year , but that didn ’ t stop techno loyalists from turning out on saturday in berlin for some radically scaled back versions of the love parade .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .
but klinsmann , who says several questions about money and personnel still need to be addressed , cautioned about jumping too quickly to a decision .
" even though all of germany is waiting for a decision , people just have to be patient .
the world cup 2006 is the biggest sporting event , and the chance wo n't come again for germany in the next 30 , 40 years .
therefore we have to look at everything very carefully , " klinsmann said .
" i will not allow myself to be pressured into something .

now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .
a little over six meters wide and four and a half meters high , the banner had waved over one of the towers at the reichstag , germany 's parliament building for years until wolfgang thierse , president of the parliament , decided to sell it to help replenish state coffers .
feeling a strong sense of patriotism , christine schmittroth purchased the tricolor for € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,050 -rrb- and hung it up over her brothel in the town of halle , in eastern germany .
on " special occasions " visitors to her establishment would be reminded of the owner 's lover for her fatherland .
but that was simply too much for neighbors and other concerned citizens who saw the action as a disgrace to the country , and schmittroth felt obliged to auction off the flag to a more worthy owner . € 16,000 for new owner she turned to the german e-bay site and started watching the bids rise .
just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .
schmittroth says she will hand over the profits from the sale to a local children 's cancer fund .
the new owner has n't said where the giant flag will fly next . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flag auction nets profit for bundestag what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .

nato took command of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- last summer .
it currently has some 6,500 troops in afghanistan , of which the largest contingent is supplied by germany with some 1,900 soldiers .
last october the alliance agreed to expand the peacekeeping force beyond the capital .
but , apart from germany , which sent 240 soldiers to the northern city of kunduz , nato has been unable to persuade governments of the need to provide more troops outside kabul .
afghan president hamid karzai has appealed to nato leaders to send more soldiers as quickly as possible , as violence continues to threaten the security of the country .
back at their june summit , the allies committed themselves to increasing troop levels to 10,000 , but have struggled coming up with the soldiers as long as the region continues to be a high-risk .
spain only recently pledged to increase its contingent in afghanistan from 140 to about 1,000 after it pulled its forces out of iraq .
in france , motivation has been low to increase the contingent above the current 540 troops .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .

three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .
" the potential is definitely there , but i am not convinced that it is the right time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " floating home " design by architects förster trabitzsch .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .

meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.07.2004 german opposition leader calls for more gay rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not go back to the 1950s " gay rights could become a top political issue in germany after guido westerwelle , leader of the free democrats , acknowledged his homosexuality for the first time and urged greater equality for same sex couples . earlier this week the leader of the neo-liberal free democrats party came out in the open on his homosexuality in a highly publicized media campaign that pushed the subject of gay rights to the front of major newspapers .
speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .
a little over six meters wide and four and a half meters high , the banner had waved over one of the towers at the reichstag , germany 's parliament building for years until wolfgang thierse , president of the parliament , decided to sell it to help replenish state coffers .
feeling a strong sense of patriotism , christine schmittroth purchased the tricolor for € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,050 -rrb- and hung it up over her brothel in the town of halle , in eastern germany .
on " special occasions " visitors to her establishment would be reminded of the owner 's lover for her fatherland .
but that was simply too much for neighbors and other concerned citizens who saw the action as a disgrace to the country , and schmittroth felt obliged to auction off the flag to a more worthy owner . € 16,000 for new owner she turned to the german e-bay site and started watching the bids rise .
just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .
schmittroth says she will hand over the profits from the sale to a local children 's cancer fund .
the new owner has n't said where the giant flag will fly next . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flag auction nets profit for bundestag what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .
in this area , the government has only gone half way , he said .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .
a little over six meters wide and four and a half meters high , the banner had waved over one of the towers at the reichstag , germany 's parliament building for years until wolfgang thierse , president of the parliament , decided to sell it to help replenish state coffers .
feeling a strong sense of patriotism , christine schmittroth purchased the tricolor for € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,050 -rrb- and hung it up over her brothel in the town of halle , in eastern germany .
on " special occasions " visitors to her establishment would be reminded of the owner 's lover for her fatherland .
but that was simply too much for neighbors and other concerned citizens who saw the action as a disgrace to the country , and schmittroth felt obliged to auction off the flag to a more worthy owner . € 16,000 for new owner she turned to the german e-bay site and started watching the bids rise .
just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .
in this area , the government has only gone half way , he said .

in the interview westerwelle sought to play down the political consequences of coming out , a move der spiegel said could lead to a " clash of cultures " with the more traditional thinking of someone like edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union .
the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .

nato took command of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- last summer .
it currently has some 6,500 troops in afghanistan , of which the largest contingent is supplied by germany with some 1,900 soldiers .
last october the alliance agreed to expand the peacekeeping force beyond the capital .
but , apart from germany , which sent 240 soldiers to the northern city of kunduz , nato has been unable to persuade governments of the need to provide more troops outside kabul .
afghan president hamid karzai has appealed to nato leaders to send more soldiers as quickly as possible , as violence continues to threaten the security of the country .
back at their june summit , the allies committed themselves to increasing troop levels to 10,000 , but have struggled coming up with the soldiers as long as the region continues to be a high-risk .
spain only recently pledged to increase its contingent in afghanistan from 140 to about 1,000 after it pulled its forces out of iraq .
in france , motivation has been low to increase the contingent above the current 540 troops .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .

us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .
in this area , the government has only gone half way , he said .
clash of cultures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition party leaders : fdp , guido westerwelle , -lrb- left -rrb- ; cdu , angela merkel , -lrb- mid -rrb- ; and csu , edmund stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- .
in the interview westerwelle sought to play down the political consequences of coming out , a move der spiegel said could lead to a " clash of cultures " with the more traditional thinking of someone like edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union .
the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .
" the fdp will never back any political attempt to return society to the 1950s .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .
but klinsmann , who says several questions about money and personnel still need to be addressed , cautioned about jumping too quickly to a decision .
" even though all of germany is waiting for a decision , people just have to be patient .
the world cup 2006 is the biggest sporting event , and the chance wo n't come again for germany in the next 30 , 40 years .
therefore we have to look at everything very carefully , " klinsmann said .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .
a little over six meters wide and four and a half meters high , the banner had waved over one of the towers at the reichstag , germany 's parliament building for years until wolfgang thierse , president of the parliament , decided to sell it to help replenish state coffers .
feeling a strong sense of patriotism , christine schmittroth purchased the tricolor for € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,050 -rrb- and hung it up over her brothel in the town of halle , in eastern germany .
on " special occasions " visitors to her establishment would be reminded of the owner 's lover for her fatherland .
but that was simply too much for neighbors and other concerned citizens who saw the action as a disgrace to the country , and schmittroth felt obliged to auction off the flag to a more worthy owner . € 16,000 for new owner she turned to the german e-bay site and started watching the bids rise .
just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .
schmittroth says she will hand over the profits from the sale to a local children 's cancer fund .
the new owner has n't said where the giant flag will fly next . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flag auction nets profit for bundestag what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .
but klinsmann , who says several questions about money and personnel still need to be addressed , cautioned about jumping too quickly to a decision .
" even though all of germany is waiting for a decision , people just have to be patient .
the world cup 2006 is the biggest sporting event , and the chance wo n't come again for germany in the next 30 , 40 years .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .
but klinsmann , who says several questions about money and personnel still need to be addressed , cautioned about jumping too quickly to a decision .
" even though all of germany is waiting for a decision , people just have to be patient .
the world cup 2006 is the biggest sporting event , and the chance wo n't come again for germany in the next 30 , 40 years .
therefore we have to look at everything very carefully , " klinsmann said .
" i will not allow myself to be pressured into something .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .
in this area , the government has only gone half way , he said .
clash of cultures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition party leaders : fdp , guido westerwelle , -lrb- left -rrb- ; cdu , angela merkel , -lrb- mid -rrb- ; and csu , edmund stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- .
in the interview westerwelle sought to play down the political consequences of coming out , a move der spiegel said could lead to a " clash of cultures " with the more traditional thinking of someone like edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union .
the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .
" the fdp will never back any political attempt to return society to the 1950s .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .
a little over six meters wide and four and a half meters high , the banner had waved over one of the towers at the reichstag , germany 's parliament building for years until wolfgang thierse , president of the parliament , decided to sell it to help replenish state coffers .
feeling a strong sense of patriotism , christine schmittroth purchased the tricolor for € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,050 -rrb- and hung it up over her brothel in the town of halle , in eastern germany .
on " special occasions " visitors to her establishment would be reminded of the owner 's lover for her fatherland .
but that was simply too much for neighbors and other concerned citizens who saw the action as a disgrace to the country , and schmittroth felt obliged to auction off the flag to a more worthy owner . € 16,000 for new owner she turned to the german e-bay site and started watching the bids rise .
just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .
schmittroth says she will hand over the profits from the sale to a local children 's cancer fund .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .
but klinsmann , who says several questions about money and personnel still need to be addressed , cautioned about jumping too quickly to a decision .
" even though all of germany is waiting for a decision , people just have to be patient .
the world cup 2006 is the biggest sporting event , and the chance wo n't come again for germany in the next 30 , 40 years .
therefore we have to look at everything very carefully , " klinsmann said .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .
peacekeeping mission continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldier in provisional reconstruction team patrols a street near taloqan in the kunduz region in feb .
2004 .
nato took command of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- last summer .
it currently has some 6,500 troops in afghanistan , of which the largest contingent is supplied by germany with some 1,900 soldiers .
last october the alliance agreed to expand the peacekeeping force beyond the capital .
but , apart from germany , which sent 240 soldiers to the northern city of kunduz , nato has been unable to persuade governments of the need to provide more troops outside kabul .
afghan president hamid karzai has appealed to nato leaders to send more soldiers as quickly as possible , as violence continues to threaten the security of the country .
back at their june summit , the allies committed themselves to increasing troop levels to 10,000 , but have struggled coming up with the soldiers as long as the region continues to be a high-risk .
spain only recently pledged to increase its contingent in afghanistan from 140 to about 1,000 after it pulled its forces out of iraq .
in france , motivation has been low to increase the contingent above the current 540 troops .
and in germany , which has troops in the balkans and the horn of africa , there is little readiness to send even more soldiers to afghanistan dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .
in this area , the government has only gone half way , he said .

in the interview westerwelle sought to play down the political consequences of coming out , a move der spiegel said could lead to a " clash of cultures " with the more traditional thinking of someone like edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union .
the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .
" the fdp will never back any political attempt to return society to the 1950s .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .
in this area , the government has only gone half way , he said .

the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .
a little over six meters wide and four and a half meters high , the banner had waved over one of the towers at the reichstag , germany 's parliament building for years until wolfgang thierse , president of the parliament , decided to sell it to help replenish state coffers .
feeling a strong sense of patriotism , christine schmittroth purchased the tricolor for € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,050 -rrb- and hung it up over her brothel in the town of halle , in eastern germany .
on " special occasions " visitors to her establishment would be reminded of the owner 's lover for her fatherland .
but that was simply too much for neighbors and other concerned citizens who saw the action as a disgrace to the country , and schmittroth felt obliged to auction off the flag to a more worthy owner . € 16,000 for new owner she turned to the german e-bay site and started watching the bids rise .
just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .
schmittroth says she will hand over the profits from the sale to a local children 's cancer fund .
the new owner has n't said where the giant flag will fly next . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flag auction nets profit for bundestag what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag .

just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .
peacekeeping mission continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldier in provisional reconstruction team patrols a street near taloqan in the kunduz region in feb .
2004 .
nato took command of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- last summer .
it currently has some 6,500 troops in afghanistan , of which the largest contingent is supplied by germany with some 1,900 soldiers .
last october the alliance agreed to expand the peacekeeping force beyond the capital .
but , apart from germany , which sent 240 soldiers to the northern city of kunduz , nato has been unable to persuade governments of the need to provide more troops outside kabul .
afghan president hamid karzai has appealed to nato leaders to send more soldiers as quickly as possible , as violence continues to threaten the security of the country .
back at their june summit , the allies committed themselves to increasing troop levels to 10,000 , but have struggled coming up with the soldiers as long as the region continues to be a high-risk .
spain only recently pledged to increase its contingent in afghanistan from 140 to about 1,000 after it pulled its forces out of iraq .
in france , motivation has been low to increase the contingent above the current 540 troops .
and in germany , which has troops in the balkans and the horn of africa , there is little readiness to send even more soldiers to afghanistan dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .
" the potential is definitely there , but i am not convinced that it is the right time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " floating home " design by architects förster trabitzsch .
whether the time is right or not , the pace of change is gathering momentum and the spree is being systematically primed for its new post as the glistening face of a truly modern city .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .
peacekeeping mission continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldier in provisional reconstruction team patrols a street near taloqan in the kunduz region in feb .
2004 .
nato took command of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- last summer .
it currently has some 6,500 troops in afghanistan , of which the largest contingent is supplied by germany with some 1,900 soldiers .
last october the alliance agreed to expand the peacekeeping force beyond the capital .
but , apart from germany , which sent 240 soldiers to the northern city of kunduz , nato has been unable to persuade governments of the need to provide more troops outside kabul .
afghan president hamid karzai has appealed to nato leaders to send more soldiers as quickly as possible , as violence continues to threaten the security of the country .
back at their june summit , the allies committed themselves to increasing troop levels to 10,000 , but have struggled coming up with the soldiers as long as the region continues to be a high-risk .
spain only recently pledged to increase its contingent in afghanistan from 140 to about 1,000 after it pulled its forces out of iraq .
in france , motivation has been low to increase the contingent above the current 540 troops .
and in germany , which has troops in the balkans and the horn of africa , there is little readiness to send even more soldiers to afghanistan dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .
a little over six meters wide and four and a half meters high , the banner had waved over one of the towers at the reichstag , germany 's parliament building for years until wolfgang thierse , president of the parliament , decided to sell it to help replenish state coffers .
feeling a strong sense of patriotism , christine schmittroth purchased the tricolor for € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,050 -rrb- and hung it up over her brothel in the town of halle , in eastern germany .
on " special occasions " visitors to her establishment would be reminded of the owner 's lover for her fatherland .
but that was simply too much for neighbors and other concerned citizens who saw the action as a disgrace to the country , and schmittroth felt obliged to auction off the flag to a more worthy owner . € 16,000 for new owner she turned to the german e-bay site and started watching the bids rise .
just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .
schmittroth says she will hand over the profits from the sale to a local children 's cancer fund .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.07.2004 german opposition leader calls for more gay rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we can not go back to the 1950s " gay rights could become a top political issue in germany after guido westerwelle , leader of the free democrats , acknowledged his homosexuality for the first time and urged greater equality for same sex couples . earlier this week the leader of the neo-liberal free democrats party came out in the open on his homosexuality in a highly publicized media campaign that pushed the subject of gay rights to the front of major newspapers .
speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .
in this area , the government has only gone half way , he said .
clash of cultures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition party leaders : fdp , guido westerwelle , -lrb- left -rrb- ; cdu , angela merkel , -lrb- mid -rrb- ; and csu , edmund stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- .
in the interview westerwelle sought to play down the political consequences of coming out , a move der spiegel said could lead to a " clash of cultures " with the more traditional thinking of someone like edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union .
the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .
" the fdp will never back any political attempt to return society to the 1950s .
on the contrary , we want to achieve more progress , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de out is in among german politicians guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neoliberal free democratic party , has appeared in public with his boyfriend for the first time .
it 's not a career-damaging move , as other leading german politicians have proven .
-lrb- july 23 , 2004 -rrb- germany mulls adoption for gay couples while some politicians in the us want to clamp down on rights for homosexuals , germany is considering expanding them .
a new law including changes on the adoption right for homosexuals has been proposed for 2005 .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .
" the potential is definitely there , but i am not convinced that it is the right time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " floating home " design by architects förster trabitzsch .

but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.07.2004 klinsmann ready to take charge of team germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new face of german soccer ?
german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .
" the potential is definitely there , but i am not convinced that it is the right time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " floating home " design by architects förster trabitzsch .
whether the time is right or not , the pace of change is gathering momentum and the spree is being systematically primed for its new post as the glistening face of a truly modern city .
with art , glass houses , warehouse conversions , bars and beaches lining the river banks , and plans for canals and futuristic floating homes , the spree is finally getting the attention it lacked for so long . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love ’ s lost parade one of europe ’ s biggest electronic music scenes lost its biggest event this year , but that didn ’ t stop techno loyalists from turning out on saturday in berlin for some radically scaled back versions of the love parade .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .

us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .
aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . -lrb- july 23 , 2004 -rrb- jockeying for a seat talk over reforms have replaced the war in iraq as the issue du jour at the un in new york .
germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council .
-lrb- july 19 , 2004 -rrb- spd and greens take stock of reforms at a two-day meeting near berlin , gerhard schröder urged his cabinet to continue with difficult reforms and to find solutions to make their implementation as conflict-free as possible .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .

the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .

meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .
" the potential is definitely there , but i am not convinced that it is the right time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " floating home " design by architects förster trabitzsch .
whether the time is right or not , the pace of change is gathering momentum and the spree is being systematically primed for its new post as the glistening face of a truly modern city .
with art , glass houses , warehouse conversions , bars and beaches lining the river banks , and plans for canals and futuristic floating homes , the spree is finally getting the attention it lacked for so long . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love ’ s lost parade one of europe ’ s biggest electronic music scenes lost its biggest event this year , but that didn ’ t stop techno loyalists from turning out on saturday in berlin for some radically scaled back versions of the love parade .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .

feeling a strong sense of patriotism , christine schmittroth purchased the tricolor for € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,050 -rrb- and hung it up over her brothel in the town of halle , in eastern germany .
on " special occasions " visitors to her establishment would be reminded of the owner 's lover for her fatherland .
but that was simply too much for neighbors and other concerned citizens who saw the action as a disgrace to the country , and schmittroth felt obliged to auction off the flag to a more worthy owner . € 16,000 for new owner she turned to the german e-bay site and started watching the bids rise .
just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .

the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .
" the potential is definitely there , but i am not convinced that it is the right time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " floating home " design by architects förster trabitzsch .
whether the time is right or not , the pace of change is gathering momentum and the spree is being systematically primed for its new post as the glistening face of a truly modern city .
with art , glass houses , warehouse conversions , bars and beaches lining the river banks , and plans for canals and futuristic floating homes , the spree is finally getting the attention it lacked for so long . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love ’ s lost parade one of europe ’ s biggest electronic music scenes lost its biggest event this year , but that didn ’ t stop techno loyalists from turning out on saturday in berlin for some radically scaled back versions of the love parade .

red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .
a little over six meters wide and four and a half meters high , the banner had waved over one of the towers at the reichstag , germany 's parliament building for years until wolfgang thierse , president of the parliament , decided to sell it to help replenish state coffers .
feeling a strong sense of patriotism , christine schmittroth purchased the tricolor for € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,050 -rrb- and hung it up over her brothel in the town of halle , in eastern germany .
on " special occasions " visitors to her establishment would be reminded of the owner 's lover for her fatherland .
but that was simply too much for neighbors and other concerned citizens who saw the action as a disgrace to the country , and schmittroth felt obliged to auction off the flag to a more worthy owner . € 16,000 for new owner she turned to the german e-bay site and started watching the bids rise .
just 24 hours before the hammer fell , however , computer hackers sabotaged the auction and schmittroth was forced to withdraw the flag .
she then re-submitted it for sale and its price began to climb again until bidder 79 was named the winner at € 16,050 .
schmittroth says she will hand over the profits from the sale to a local children 's cancer fund .
the new owner has n't said where the giant flag will fly next . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flag auction nets profit for bundestag what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?

in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.07.2004 nato approves more troops for afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still more soldiers are needed .
after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .
peacekeeping mission continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldier in provisional reconstruction team patrols a street near taloqan in the kunduz region in feb .
2004 .
nato took command of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- last summer .
it currently has some 6,500 troops in afghanistan , of which the largest contingent is supplied by germany with some 1,900 soldiers .
last october the alliance agreed to expand the peacekeeping force beyond the capital .
but , apart from germany , which sent 240 soldiers to the northern city of kunduz , nato has been unable to persuade governments of the need to provide more troops outside kabul .
afghan president hamid karzai has appealed to nato leaders to send more soldiers as quickly as possible , as violence continues to threaten the security of the country .
back at their june summit , the allies committed themselves to increasing troop levels to 10,000 , but have struggled coming up with the soldiers as long as the region continues to be a high-risk .
spain only recently pledged to increase its contingent in afghanistan from 140 to about 1,000 after it pulled its forces out of iraq .
in france , motivation has been low to increase the contingent above the current 540 troops .
and in germany , which has troops in the balkans and the horn of africa , there is little readiness to send even more soldiers to afghanistan dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .
but klinsmann , who says several questions about money and personnel still need to be addressed , cautioned about jumping too quickly to a decision .
" even though all of germany is waiting for a decision , people just have to be patient .
the world cup 2006 is the biggest sporting event , and the chance wo n't come again for germany in the next 30 , 40 years .
therefore we have to look at everything very carefully , " klinsmann said .
" i will not allow myself to be pressured into something .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .
" it 's not really clear exactly , " said lt. col. ludger terbrüggen , spokesman at the alliance 's military headquarters in southern belgium .
but , he said , " we need a little bit more to get to 3,500 . "
de hoop scheffer most likely will lobby alliance members to muster more soldiers , terbrüggen said , still confident nato would meet its pledge .

it currently has some 6,500 troops in afghanistan , of which the largest contingent is supplied by germany with some 1,900 soldiers .
last october the alliance agreed to expand the peacekeeping force beyond the capital .
but , apart from germany , which sent 240 soldiers to the northern city of kunduz , nato has been unable to persuade governments of the need to provide more troops outside kabul .
afghan president hamid karzai has appealed to nato leaders to send more soldiers as quickly as possible , as violence continues to threaten the security of the country .
back at their june summit , the allies committed themselves to increasing troop levels to 10,000 , but have struggled coming up with the soldiers as long as the region continues to be a high-risk .
spain only recently pledged to increase its contingent in afghanistan from 140 to about 1,000 after it pulled its forces out of iraq .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .

holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .
but klinsmann , who says several questions about money and personnel still need to be addressed , cautioned about jumping too quickly to a decision .
" even though all of germany is waiting for a decision , people just have to be patient .
the world cup 2006 is the biggest sporting event , and the chance wo n't come again for germany in the next 30 , 40 years .
therefore we have to look at everything very carefully , " klinsmann said .
" i will not allow myself to be pressured into something .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .
" the potential is definitely there , but i am not convinced that it is the right time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " floating home " design by architects förster trabitzsch .
whether the time is right or not , the pace of change is gathering momentum and the spree is being systematically primed for its new post as the glistening face of a truly modern city .

now this jaded jewel is being dusted down and polished to a state-of-the-art sparkle . when pitched against the likes of the river thames or the seine which uncompromisingly cut through the hearts of their respective cities , dividing the rich from the poor and the ' in ' from the ' out ' , the spree is a serene waterway , which seems to seep rather than snake its path north .
but if planners and architects get their way , it 's only a matter of time before that serenity is replaced with glittering architecture and an altogether busier life . berliners have long been at pains to get passionate about their river , which has never been given much significance in the overall landscape of the capital .
" berlin has turned its back on the spree .
take the berliner dom , for example , it 's back side faces the water , " mr. rainer milzkott , public relations manager for urbanpr told dw-world .
and his example is not the only one , there are countless significant old buildings in berlin , which although located on or near the banks of the river , were built with their entrances facing away from the water . waterside media city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv 's waterside offices heads are now firmly turned towards the city 's liquid assets , which is still a blank enough canvas to enable the creation of entire little worlds .
three years ago , a group of private investors got together with the express intention of turning a 3 km stretch of the spree into a media landscape .
the area , aptly dubbed media spree has already witnessed the conversion and creation of an eclectic mix of buildings which now accommodate the city 's growing media scene .
" the main aim is to attract media companies , and to continue developing that field . "
christian meyer , managing director of media spree told dw-world . it 's an ambitious plan , but so far it 's working .
no sooner were mtv and universal ensconced in their waterside homes , than other companies , such as meidalynx and the service trade union , verdi were following suit .
but it does n't stop there .
the media spree project has grand plans to create a number of little canals leading inland from the spree .
" the idea is to create more waterfront property and more office space .
it could have a touch of amsterdam , or of the london docklands , " meyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a possible future face of the spree but the fact is that neither amsterdam nor london seem to have the same troubles shifting their waterside office space - something berlin has had an excess of ever since reunification almost 15 years ago .
meyer , however , is not worried about filling empty space .
he believes the media aspect of the location will be enough to hook those in the industry .
" we 've had a lot of enquiries for converted flats from people in the music business , or in fashion , television and film .
the combination of the water and industrial backdrop offers them a particular flair , " meyer said . great views for relatively little if other european capitals are anything to go by , that waterfront flair is a luxury reserved for the wealthy . but meyer ca n't see berlin falling victim to such a cliché . " people are afraid that everything will be gentrified , but there are enough places , enough little niches for everyone , at prices people can afford . "
they may be affordable , but rainer milzkott does n't believe berliners are really ready to take this new found appreciation of the river seriously .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.07.2004 brothel owner sells german parliament flag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where will it wave next ?
red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building . it was probably germany 's most notorious flag .
a little over six meters wide and four and a half meters high , the banner had waved over one of the towers at the reichstag , germany 's parliament building for years until wolfgang thierse , president of the parliament , decided to sell it to help replenish state coffers .
feeling a strong sense of patriotism , christine schmittroth purchased the tricolor for € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,050 -rrb- and hung it up over her brothel in the town of halle , in eastern germany .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .
in this area , the government has only gone half way , he said .

in the interview westerwelle sought to play down the political consequences of coming out , a move der spiegel said could lead to a " clash of cultures " with the more traditional thinking of someone like edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union .
the magazine noted that some members in the csu viewed homosexuality as perverse and cited stoiber once saying germany could talk about devil worship if it put gay partnerships on a par with marriage .
the fdp leader said he had already made it clear to leaders in the opposition and likely coalition partners on the national level that germany needed to make more progress in gay rights and not reverse earlier legislation .
" the fdp will never back any political attempt to return society to the 1950s .

speaking out on the issue for the first time on saturday , guido westerwelle told the german newsmagazine der spiegel that the country needed to do more to promote equality for gay couples .
germany needs to be more tolerant on homosexuality , the opposition politician said .
" i support more understanding on the issue , " he told the magazine in its upcoming edition .
westerwelle said gay couples should have the right to adopt any child and not , as in a law proposed by the government , only the legal child of one partner .
they should also be entitled to the same tax breaks as married couples , he said .
more equal rights germany has allowed same-sex partnerships with some legal rights since 2001 but they do not go as far as marriage .
draft legislation presented by the coalition government of social democrats and greens will extend gay partners ' rights , but westerwelle dismissed the proposals as half measures .
" at the moment same-sex partnerships have a lot of duties , for example the requirement to assist a partner financially in terms of social welfare .
at the same time , the deserved rights are being denied .
that can not be fair , " he argued .
westerwelle also urged equal application of tax law to include the same benefits enjoyed by married couples .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.07.2004 nato approves more troops for afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still more soldiers are needed .
after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .
9 .
us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .
officials at nato headquarters did not say who would provide these troops .

after months of deliberating , nato has agreed to deploy extra troops to help provide security during afghan presidential elections in october . two additional battalions of some 1,800 soldiers are scheduled to head to afghanistan ahead of the fall elections , nato secretary general jaap de hoop schheffer said in a statement late friday .
the troops from spain and italy will arrive in afghanistan by september and stay for about two months .
the election is planned for oct .

us ambassador to nato nicholas burns applauded the move , calling it " a significant step in the efforts of the international community to help the afghan people . "
the alliance had delayed sending additional troops to the still unstable country for months , and some critics have argued that friday 's decision fell short of promises made by nato leaders in june .
at that time they had pledged an additional 3,500 troops for bolstering security ahead of the elections .
commander chris henderson , a spokesman for the nato-led peacekeeping force in the afghan capital of kabul , said another battalion would be on standby as part of a reserve contingent outside the country .
although he did not give specifics , he noted that a battalion has between 600 and 1,000 soldiers .
" nato has not failed in meeting its commitment , " he insisted .
in need of more troops in addition to the election security forces , the alliance agreed to provide some 500 additional troops to beef up five so-called provincial reconstruction teams , which are designed to help the central government extend its authority across the country .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .
but klinsmann , who says several questions about money and personnel still need to be addressed , cautioned about jumping too quickly to a decision .
" even though all of germany is waiting for a decision , people just have to be patient .
the world cup 2006 is the biggest sporting event , and the chance wo n't come again for germany in the next 30 , 40 years .
therefore we have to look at everything very carefully , " klinsmann said .
" i will not allow myself to be pressured into something .

german soccer should n't hail its new national coach yet .
although jürgen klinsmann says he 's keen to take on the job , the details still have to be hammered out and there is always room for a surprise . the former germany captain and world cup player wants to become his country 's next national coach .
in previous discussions klinsmann had already said he was willing to help the germany team but had been vague about exactly what his role would be .
now that his name is on the table along with oliver bierhoff as team manager and holger osieck as co-trainer , klinsmann is more up front about his ambitions .
" my role should be that of team coach , " he told a news conference at the frankfurt airport on saturday .
the former bayern munich striker , who arrived in germany from the united states where he has been living since ending his playing career in 1998 , said the national team needs new methods and ideas .
" i have said in my discussions -lrb- with german soccer officials -rrb- that it 's important for me to build up a team that has trust in itself , " he stressed , making clear his goals for showcasing germany when it hosts the world cup in 2006 .
he also plans to infuse a good bit more professionalism into the team .
after having spent several years following us sports , klinsmann believes the german squad could profit greatly from restructuring .
" there 's a whole entourage of people taking care of a team .
there 's the psychological advisor , someone responsible for speed , someone for the techniques , " the 37-year old described the situation in the united states .
experienced help klinsmann , who scored 47 goals in 108 games and lifted the world cup in 1990 , is currently in talks with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- about the exact details of the job .
having never coached a team before , he will probably get help for more seasoned candidates .
" if i were to play this role as team coach then it 's clear i would do this in cooperation with a very experienced trainer , " klinsmann said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer star oliver bierhoff could be the next national team 's manager .
holger osieck , coach franz beckenbauer 's assistant during germany 's winning 1990 world cup performance , and former germany striker oliver bierhoff are likely to round off the training trio .
osieck , who not only aided beckenbauer but also coached canada and worked for fifa , would most likely bring the technical expertise to the team , while the friendly and affable bierhoff would be suited for public relations .
patience needed after the high profile rejections from bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld and otto rehhagel , who guided greece to its euro 2004 triumph , german soccer was in desperate need to fill the position vacated by rudi völler .

foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy campaigning for a permanent seat on the un security council .
greens party co-chair reinhard bütikofer talks to dw-tv about germany 's foreign policy goals and reform plans . after a 10-day , five-country tour of asia , fischer has returned to germany with little in the way of concrete support for his efforts to secure a permanent seat at the un security council .
the greens party member and vocal opponent to the us war in iraq had hoped for endorsements from countries who agreed with germany 's approach to more multi-lateralism in the world community .
instead he was greeted with tacit words and a compromise agreement from india which also has its sights focused on the un 's powerful decision-making table .
dw-tv spoke with fischer 's party colleague and co-chair of the greens reinhard bütikofer about germany playing a bigger role on the world stage and how the coalition with the social democrats has been holding up under a series of unpopular social reforms back home .
dw-tv : foreign minister joschka fischer has been busy drumming up support for a permanent seat on the un security council .
why should germany have a seat at the table ?
bütikofer : i would look at the question differently .
i would ask , what contribution does germany make to the international community - it 's a big one .
in the last years , specifically through the work of the red-green coalition , germany has taken on additional responsibility .
just think about our activities - and not just military but rather diplomatic and economic - in the balkans .
think about what we have done for peacekeeping in afghanistan .
think about the role we played in defending multi-lateralism as the basis for a rational international world order as opposed to the one-sided strategies from washington .
germany gained a good deal of respect and as joschka fischer reports , many countries not only view us with respect but would like to see germany continue to play such a role .
not too long ago the greens were in favor of an eu seat on the security council .
now the foreign minister is backing a national , a german proposal .
why the change in approach ?
i do n't really see it as a change in thinking .
if it were possible to achieve a european seat on the security council , that would be a good solution .
but i do n't think there 's much sense - in this area and in many others - to only concentrate on what is ideal , but rather to look at what we can accomplish practically speaking .
while the social democrats continue to suffer a serious decline in popularity , the greens - the junior partner in the governing coalition - have reached an all-time high in approval ratings .
what is the greens ' recipe for success ?
i think it is the unity that we have managed to build in the party in the last two and a half years .
we started early on preparing our voters for the reforms , telling them they were necessary and what direction we would have to take .
as greens we have a vision for the modern social system and we have made it clear : basic insurance for everyone , respect for everyone , especially for those who through no fault of their own have come on hard times .
and these ideas are the basis of our proposals .
they are the basis of a social republic .
is the government coalition faltering under the weakness of the spd ?
the government has so many things ahead of it , that it can not allow itself to be derailed by the current difficulties .
the chancellor , the leaders in the spd and we ourselves know that many people have invested their hopes in us .
the current discussions show that the country knows it must change .
it 's now a question of which direction to take .
the direction we the greens support is the course of renewal coupled with social justice .
i think when you look at the discussions of the last few days , where for example top daimlerchrysler managers jerked around employees in pay negotiations , then you realize there 's a chance that those who are greedy will get ahead and that the system of social security could be destroyed .
i think that 's enough of a reason to keep trying , to bear the responsibility and say : we 'll make this happen . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer finds few backers for un seat german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .

mr mandelson , who has twice resigned from the cabinet , was defending his appointment as the uk 's next european commissioner .
he insisted he would not have been appointed by tony blair unless the prime minister believed he was the best man for the job .
but he admitted he now faces possibly the biggest challenge of his career .
he is expected to take up the job on 1 november , once the commission has been approved by the european parliament .
mr mandelson told bbc radio 4 's today programme britain 's influence in europe had increased in recent years but he needed to raise europe 's stock with the british people .
mandelson 's career 1979-82 lambeth councillor 1982-85 producer at london weekend television late 1980s director of labour party campaigns and communications 1992 became mp for hartlepool 1994 supported blair 's leadership bid 1997 ran labour 's election campaign 1997 named cabinet minister without portfolio 1998 secretary of state for trade and industry 1998 resigned over geoffrey robinson house loan affair 1999 returned as secretary of state for northern ireland 2001 resigned over hinduja passports affair profile : peter mandelson mandelson ' to pursue eu reform ' " people do see how british influence in the european union has grown .
we are leaders not followers now .
we are certainly not parked on the sidelines , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
mr mandelson said he hopes to make brussels more accountable , create a clear set of priorities in a focused strategy for the eu , ensure european regulations help and not hinder the creation of new jobs and he hopes to help make europe a safer place .
" as a member of a rather disliked brussels commission with a european union which is not universally popular , i will be doing my bit to turn that round .
" i think that is why prime minister persuaded me to take on the job .
" it is a huge challenge , bigger than anything i have taken on before , bigger possibly even than helping to turn round the labour party from near political extinction in the 1980s , " he added .
pro-european mr mandelson said the british public will have a " huge opportunity " to decide where they want to go in europe in the forthcoming referendum on the constitutional treaty .
on friday prime minister tony blair ended months of speculation about the future of his close friend .
but the tories say they believe he is too pro-european , while some labour mps criticised the move as " cronyism " .
mr mandelson refused to be drawn on whether he had discussed a further cabinet post with mr blair .
he told bbc2 's newsnight : " there is always a little bit of me that wants to come back to the cabinet because i want to be vindicated in that sense given the rather unfair circumstances of my last departure .
criticism " but i have always recognised the difficulties of returning to the cabinet and i think now , for example , given the very predictable media frenzy that would have accompanied it would not be a good idea . "
there was speculation the idea of his return to the cabinet for a third time was dropped after fierce opposition from some senior ministers , including john prescott .
the appointment means a possibly uncomfortable by-election in mr mandelson 's hartlepool seat , where labour has a 15,000 majority .
mr blair said : " we need the very best person representing britain in europe and peter mandelson has the skills , ability and contacts in europe to make a great success of it . "
but there has been criticism of the move from eurosceptics within mr mandelson 's own party .
ian davidson , of lobby group labour against a european superstate , described the appointment as an " appalling " example of cronyism .
and former minister kate hoey said it was a setback for the " yes " campaigners .
tory co-party chairman liam fox said mr mandelson would not stand up for the uk in europe as he was too pro-european .
