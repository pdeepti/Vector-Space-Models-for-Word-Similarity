on jan .
1 , the european union ’ s new clean air laws come into effect .
what promises to give more germans a breath of fresh air has the country of car lovers up in arms . germany is a country of cars .
the automobile industry is famous for its quality products and in particular german men are often accused of loving their cars more than anything else in their lives . a european union directive could put an end to this - or at least hamper this loving relationship . in just a few days , from jan .
1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .
" but all want to ensure as low a threshold of cuts as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new limits stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .
metzger said it was still unclear whether this will lead to a wave of class-action lawsuits . ensuring individual mobility germany ’ s powerful automobile association adac is worried that the new laws could impair mobility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on a highway near munich " all measures against air pollution can only take hold if they also apply to the main sources , " said adac ’ s vice-president for transportation , erhard oehm .
authorities could not put all eggs in one basket . " since cars with gasoline engines hardly and diesel-powered cars only marginally contribute to the emissions , this has to be considered accordingly , " said oehm .
" individual mobility must continue to be ensured by all the measures affecting road traffic . " according to oehm , speed limits were not a viable alternative , as they had in the past hardly led to a decrease in air pollutants .
closing inner cities to traffic should only be considered in extreme situations , he said .
more intelligent traffic control , such as a progressive stoplight system , would be more effective , he said . a viable alternative the background of the eu directive is the simple fact that these particulate materials are harmful to health . " respiratory and cardiovascular diseases can to a high degree be traced back to inhaled fine dust , " trittin said .
" especially in metropolitan areas , hundreds and thousands of people fall ill for this reason every year , and many cases are fatal . " one viable alternative is busses , taxis and cars , which run on natural gas , a possibility also supported by adac .
these vehicles do not pose a problem with respect to particulates or nitrogen oxide .
also , biogenious fuels are exempted from germany ’ s high petroleum tax . according to figures by the federal association of the german gas industry , some 27,000 natural gas vehicles were on german roads in 2004 .
this marked a 40 percent increase to the previous year .
at the same time , the german gas industry opens three new natural gas stations - per week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening traffic in berlin natural gas is one solution to tackle the measures imposed by the eu directive .
the next obstacle approaches , though .
in 2010 , strict emission limits for nitrogen oxides , a pollutant emitted primarily by cars and trucks and a precursor to ozone , come into effect .
then , german drivers will face even more restrictions in their loving relationships to their cars . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de future looks dark for germany 's black forest germany 's best-known tourist attraction , the black forest , may be losing some of its luxuriance as a new environmental report warns of dire damage in the region wrought by pollution .

what promises to give more germans a breath of fresh air has the country of car lovers up in arms . germany is a country of cars .
the automobile industry is famous for its quality products and in particular german men are often accused of loving their cars more than anything else in their lives . a european union directive could put an end to this - or at least hamper this loving relationship . in just a few days , from jan .
1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .
" but all want to ensure as low a threshold of cuts as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new limits stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .
metzger said it was still unclear whether this will lead to a wave of class-action lawsuits . ensuring individual mobility germany ’ s powerful automobile association adac is worried that the new laws could impair mobility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on a highway near munich " all measures against air pollution can only take hold if they also apply to the main sources , " said adac ’ s vice-president for transportation , erhard oehm .
authorities could not put all eggs in one basket . " since cars with gasoline engines hardly and diesel-powered cars only marginally contribute to the emissions , this has to be considered accordingly , " said oehm .
" individual mobility must continue to be ensured by all the measures affecting road traffic . " according to oehm , speed limits were not a viable alternative , as they had in the past hardly led to a decrease in air pollutants .
closing inner cities to traffic should only be considered in extreme situations , he said .
more intelligent traffic control , such as a progressive stoplight system , would be more effective , he said . a viable alternative the background of the eu directive is the simple fact that these particulate materials are harmful to health . " respiratory and cardiovascular diseases can to a high degree be traced back to inhaled fine dust , " trittin said .
" especially in metropolitan areas , hundreds and thousands of people fall ill for this reason every year , and many cases are fatal . " one viable alternative is busses , taxis and cars , which run on natural gas , a possibility also supported by adac .
these vehicles do not pose a problem with respect to particulates or nitrogen oxide .
also , biogenious fuels are exempted from germany ’ s high petroleum tax . according to figures by the federal association of the german gas industry , some 27,000 natural gas vehicles were on german roads in 2004 .
this marked a 40 percent increase to the previous year .

1 , the european union ’ s new clean air laws come into effect .
what promises to give more germans a breath of fresh air has the country of car lovers up in arms . germany is a country of cars .
the automobile industry is famous for its quality products and in particular german men are often accused of loving their cars more than anything else in their lives . a european union directive could put an end to this - or at least hamper this loving relationship . in just a few days , from jan .
1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .
" but all want to ensure as low a threshold of cuts as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new limits stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .
metzger said it was still unclear whether this will lead to a wave of class-action lawsuits . ensuring individual mobility germany ’ s powerful automobile association adac is worried that the new laws could impair mobility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on a highway near munich " all measures against air pollution can only take hold if they also apply to the main sources , " said adac ’ s vice-president for transportation , erhard oehm .
authorities could not put all eggs in one basket . " since cars with gasoline engines hardly and diesel-powered cars only marginally contribute to the emissions , this has to be considered accordingly , " said oehm .
" individual mobility must continue to be ensured by all the measures affecting road traffic . " according to oehm , speed limits were not a viable alternative , as they had in the past hardly led to a decrease in air pollutants .
closing inner cities to traffic should only be considered in extreme situations , he said .
more intelligent traffic control , such as a progressive stoplight system , would be more effective , he said . a viable alternative the background of the eu directive is the simple fact that these particulate materials are harmful to health . " respiratory and cardiovascular diseases can to a high degree be traced back to inhaled fine dust , " trittin said .
" especially in metropolitan areas , hundreds and thousands of people fall ill for this reason every year , and many cases are fatal . " one viable alternative is busses , taxis and cars , which run on natural gas , a possibility also supported by adac .
these vehicles do not pose a problem with respect to particulates or nitrogen oxide .
also , biogenious fuels are exempted from germany ’ s high petroleum tax . according to figures by the federal association of the german gas industry , some 27,000 natural gas vehicles were on german roads in 2004 .
this marked a 40 percent increase to the previous year .
at the same time , the german gas industry opens three new natural gas stations - per week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening traffic in berlin natural gas is one solution to tackle the measures imposed by the eu directive .
the next obstacle approaches , though .
in 2010 , strict emission limits for nitrogen oxides , a pollutant emitted primarily by cars and trucks and a precursor to ozone , come into effect .

"
it might , however , be " bread . "
or chocolate , honey , mashed potatoes , or mustard .
indeed , as some entrepreneurs have discovered , however well germans living abroad may adjust to their new country , they rarely lose the longing for those edible things they grew up with .
for norbert gutheins of kleinmanchow , in brandenburg - a town known , incidentally , for its typically german sweet mustard - it all started with a newspaper article about an american oma with a criminal streak .
the granny would smuggle popular german treats known as kinderüberraschung , or kinder surprise , to her grandson in america .
shipping allowed strict american food laws forbid the sale of the hollow chocolate eggs , which contain small plastic toys inside .
but while they could not be purchased in the united states at the time , shipping them into the country is not illegal .
from the initial idea of sending kinder surprise overseas , it was a small step to a more general concept : a mail order company that ships german food products anywhere in the world .
chocolate and sauerkraut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guglhupf bakery in durham today , gutheins works out of the basement of his kleinmanchow home , packing the orders that he picks from his internet site .
he sends chocolate to brazil , sauerkraut to finland , and yes , kinder surprise to america , even though stores there now sell the eggs as well .
he ships to wherever germans live - or at least to wherever someone lives who is desperate for a taste of german coffee or haribo gummy bears .
while gutheins managed to share the taste of the homeland from his own back yard , other germans have taken a different route .
hartmut jahn is the owner of the guglhupf bakery , in durham , north carolina .
durham is in an area known as the research triangle , known for its many universities and biotech firms .
the area has a strong international population , among which are a lot of germans .
many of them have never grown to appreciate the soft , packaged white bread found on american supermarket shelves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german loaves a few years ago , jahn and his then-partner claudia cooper decided they wanted to give up their jobs at a munich computer firm .
cooper had studied in the united states , and had realized that above all , germans living in america missed their beloved bread .
she quit her job , spent two years at a traditional munich bakery learning the trade , and together with jahn , opened up the durham shop .
stollen for america " we had just one shot at success , " cooper said .
" we did n't have enough money for second chances . "
in the beginning , there were 16-hour days among the mixers , ovens and flour dust .
as a result , the relationship hit the skids - but the bakery flourished .
their nut-buns , sesame rolls , and traditional german whole-grain breads are hot items in the research triangle .
their christmas stollen gets sent to germans across the country .
amid all the fine baking , jahn seems to think kinder surprise would be out of place .
" we would n't sell them even if we were allowed to , " he said .
" we have an upscale clientele . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical german breakfast still , the eggs are an item on norbert guthein 's inventory , and they regularly get sent to us customers .
guthein said he guesses that about half of those customers are german .
" the rest maybe came here on vacation , and in america there are also a lot of soldiers who used to be stationed in germany , " he said .
if guthein had it his way , he would do more business with people outside the united states .
since 2002 , when the food industry bioterrorism act went into effect , he has had to enter a product-by-product listing of the contents of every package onto an online form .
it takes him a half hour to fill out each one .
guthein said he never stops being surprised by what people order from his company .
kinder surprise is old hat , as is german party pumpernickel and baking mix for sprouted spelt bread .
but what is so special about dried mixed herbs , or kaba brand cocoa powder , guthein wondered .
he only put them in his product line after people asked for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it probably has to do with being homesick for everyday things , " he said .
that way , the steaming cup of cocoa will taste just like it did way back when .
or the prickel-pit fizzy candy will take you back to your childhood .
so , what is the worst thing he has ever had to mail abroad ?

no one knows for sure which of two skulls belonged to the 18th century poet though dna analysis could resolve it . one skull rests in an ornate oak coffin next to that of schiller 's friend and fellow poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , in the weimar ducal vault .
the other sits in an unmarked , inconspicuous casket .
experts bicker over which skull was schiller 's . although dna analysis would likely clear up the confusion , the weimar classics foundation , which oversees schiller and goethe memorial sites in the eastern german state of thuringia , has shown no interest in resolving the issue . " no investigations are planned , " spokeswoman angela jahn told bild daily .
" that would n't change anything anyway .
we need a comparative value for an analysis , but a hair , for example , could also not be genuine . " actually , any material upon which schiller 's dna traces have been preserved would suffice , whether from his clothing or from a descendent , anthropologist ursula wittwer-backofen told the associated press .
mixed-up exhumation ? schiller 's body was buried in a mass grave in weimar on the night of his death on may 11 , 1805 .
but it had n't found its final resting place .
schiller 's widow intended her husband be buried in an individual grave . still , the plot was n't re-opened until 1826 , by which time the coffins had burst and the bodies had decomposed .
weimar mayor karl leberecht schwabe set up the 23 recovered skulls on a table , pointed to the largest one and declared , " that must be schiller 's skull . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller statue in weimar half a year later , goethe collected the skull , which he kept on blue velvet cushion underneath a bell jar .
since december 1827 the skull and other bones attributed to schiller have rested in the oak coffin in weimar 's ducal vault . hermann welcker was the first to call the skull 's authenticity into question , in 1883 .
although experts agreed with the anatomist , laymen were outraged .
finally , in 1911 , another exhumation of the mass grave brought forth 63 additional skulls , one of which was said to be schiller 's , according to göttingen philologist albrecht schöne , who wrote a book about the mix-up .
the second skull was moved to the weimer ducal vault in 1914 . " it would certainly be embarrassing for the -lrb- weimar classics -rrb- foundation , if both skulls were proven to be false , " schöne said . besides , the foundation is likely more concerned with the restoration of the 16th-18th century books from the anna amalia library - which was badly damaged by fire in september - than with resolving the skull question . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.12.2004 schiller 's skulls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller -lrb- 1759-1805 -rrb- : where has his head gone ?
as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .
no one knows for sure which of two skulls belonged to the 18th century poet though dna analysis could resolve it . one skull rests in an ornate oak coffin next to that of schiller 's friend and fellow poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , in the weimar ducal vault .
the other sits in an unmarked , inconspicuous casket .
experts bicker over which skull was schiller 's . although dna analysis would likely clear up the confusion , the weimar classics foundation , which oversees schiller and goethe memorial sites in the eastern german state of thuringia , has shown no interest in resolving the issue . " no investigations are planned , " spokeswoman angela jahn told bild daily .
" that would n't change anything anyway .
we need a comparative value for an analysis , but a hair , for example , could also not be genuine . " actually , any material upon which schiller 's dna traces have been preserved would suffice , whether from his clothing or from a descendent , anthropologist ursula wittwer-backofen told the associated press .
mixed-up exhumation ? schiller 's body was buried in a mass grave in weimar on the night of his death on may 11 , 1805 .
but it had n't found its final resting place .
schiller 's widow intended her husband be buried in an individual grave . still , the plot was n't re-opened until 1826 , by which time the coffins had burst and the bodies had decomposed .
weimar mayor karl leberecht schwabe set up the 23 recovered skulls on a table , pointed to the largest one and declared , " that must be schiller 's skull . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller statue in weimar half a year later , goethe collected the skull , which he kept on blue velvet cushion underneath a bell jar .
since december 1827 the skull and other bones attributed to schiller have rested in the oak coffin in weimar 's ducal vault . hermann welcker was the first to call the skull 's authenticity into question , in 1883 .
although experts agreed with the anatomist , laymen were outraged .
finally , in 1911 , another exhumation of the mass grave brought forth 63 additional skulls , one of which was said to be schiller 's , according to göttingen philologist albrecht schöne , who wrote a book about the mix-up .
the second skull was moved to the weimer ducal vault in 1914 . " it would certainly be embarrassing for the -lrb- weimar classics -rrb- foundation , if both skulls were proven to be false , " schöne said . besides , the foundation is likely more concerned with the restoration of the 16th-18th century books from the anna amalia library - which was badly damaged by fire in september - than with resolving the skull question . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 29.12.2004 should turkey join the eu ?
back to first page back 2/2 german conservatives have turned to colleagues in france for help in blocking turkey 's bid to join the european union .
dw readers weighed in on whether turkey should indeed become part of the bloc .
since turkey is not a european country -lrb- 96 percent of her landmass is geographically in europe and the 4 percent that is is due to an historical fluke -rrb- , it should not be admitted into the eu .
having said that , the eu could sign a free-trade agreement with turkey like it would with any other sovereign nation .
but that should be the extent of the relationship .
and i find it appalling that turkey is seeking to dictate the terms of negotiation .
who does she think she is when she says " we will not accept any other conditions ? "
she is not in any position to insist upon anything .
she wants to join the club , the club does not want her in .
therefore , turkey should either be willing to accept whatever the eu requires or she should stay out .
how badly does she want to join ?
then she needs to start taking responsibility for what she wants .
if she 's not prepared to do so , she should not be allowed to join . - felicity hope , singapore if turkey was not a moslem country i would say " yes , " but with radical islam spreading at an alarming rate , having them in the eu would be like inviting in a " trojan turkey . "
better to wait until the jihad movement has been totally eradicated . - charles reichert , canada i usually encourage stronger relationships between germany and turkey , however after personal experience i can say : a full eu membership for turkey is a huge step -lrb- that -rrb- will cost the eu -lrb- a great -rrb- price !
what should the eu do ?
one , the eu should start long negotiations with the turkish end with a conditional membership to put the eu on the safe side .
two , the eu should try to figure out why turkey needs full eu membership and then try to put more solutions on the table , things the turks ca n't deny . - aiman yunes as a cypriot i am hoping that prime minister erdogan keeps his word .
i understand that he also has tremendous pressure internally , and it wo n't be easy for him to simply dismiss his opponents -lrb- army , right wingers -rrb- by recognizing cyprus .
however , one has to admit that if you do want to be part of a family , you need to be in good standing with all the people in the family .
i would like to see turkey in the eu , because deep down the people are n't bad .
the country 's military , however , used to impose its will over everyone as initially it was the only way to control the diversity in that country .
even though i think it 's a fair deal , it will come down , once again , to how much does erdogan get over the army . - theo theocharides turks tend to be much more moderate in their approach to islam .
the turkish approach to islam in one 's personal life , for example , could be a " role-model " for the other moslem peoples , living currently within the eu .
sure the turkish model of democracy has n't been a smooth one , and they are still " working " things out , but let 's not forget even germany had its hitler , and there 's nothing so bad in the turkish model of democracy that could parallel germany 's hitler or russia 's stalin .
europe faces " roughly " two futures .
the first would leave europe as a largely christian club with economic associations , lacking true diversity and any means of affecting its policies anywhere on the globe .
the second choice would define a much different europe ; one that is both culturally , ethnically diverse and possibly one with a more unified presence and greater military ability to effect its policies and desires around the globe ; providing a " balance " to other , currently much more powerful , countries .
however , it takes " vision " to take the second approach .
it takes the ability to see beyond paranoia -lrb- " the moslems are out to get us " -rrb- and fears -lrb- " how will we ever support them all ! " -rrb- .
the eu could " throw " in a " monkey-wrench " of sorts in to the works in the form of " humiliating " demands that would simply derail the whole works .
but it would be too naive to expect the turks to not see such tactics for simply what they are : excuses covering the real reasons behind the rejection . - mustapha stokely , cape girardeau , missouri , usa back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

back to first page back 2/2 german conservatives have turned to colleagues in france for help in blocking turkey 's bid to join the european union .
dw readers weighed in on whether turkey should indeed become part of the bloc .
since turkey is not a european country -lrb- 96 percent of her landmass is geographically in europe and the 4 percent that is is due to an historical fluke -rrb- , it should not be admitted into the eu .
having said that , the eu could sign a free-trade agreement with turkey like it would with any other sovereign nation .
but that should be the extent of the relationship .
and i find it appalling that turkey is seeking to dictate the terms of negotiation .
who does she think she is when she says " we will not accept any other conditions ? "
she is not in any position to insist upon anything .
she wants to join the club , the club does not want her in .
therefore , turkey should either be willing to accept whatever the eu requires or she should stay out .
how badly does she want to join ?
then she needs to start taking responsibility for what she wants .
if she 's not prepared to do so , she should not be allowed to join . - felicity hope , singapore if turkey was not a moslem country i would say " yes , " but with radical islam spreading at an alarming rate , having them in the eu would be like inviting in a " trojan turkey . "
better to wait until the jihad movement has been totally eradicated . - charles reichert , canada i usually encourage stronger relationships between germany and turkey , however after personal experience i can say : a full eu membership for turkey is a huge step -lrb- that -rrb- will cost the eu -lrb- a great -rrb- price !
what should the eu do ?
one , the eu should start long negotiations with the turkish end with a conditional membership to put the eu on the safe side .
two , the eu should try to figure out why turkey needs full eu membership and then try to put more solutions on the table , things the turks ca n't deny . - aiman yunes as a cypriot i am hoping that prime minister erdogan keeps his word .
i understand that he also has tremendous pressure internally , and it wo n't be easy for him to simply dismiss his opponents -lrb- army , right wingers -rrb- by recognizing cyprus .
however , one has to admit that if you do want to be part of a family , you need to be in good standing with all the people in the family .
i would like to see turkey in the eu , because deep down the people are n't bad .
the country 's military , however , used to impose its will over everyone as initially it was the only way to control the diversity in that country .
even though i think it 's a fair deal , it will come down , once again , to how much does erdogan get over the army . - theo theocharides turks tend to be much more moderate in their approach to islam .
the turkish approach to islam in one 's personal life , for example , could be a " role-model " for the other moslem peoples , living currently within the eu .
sure the turkish model of democracy has n't been a smooth one , and they are still " working " things out , but let 's not forget even germany had its hitler , and there 's nothing so bad in the turkish model of democracy that could parallel germany 's hitler or russia 's stalin .
europe faces " roughly " two futures .
the first would leave europe as a largely christian club with economic associations , lacking true diversity and any means of affecting its policies anywhere on the globe .
the second choice would define a much different europe ; one that is both culturally , ethnically diverse and possibly one with a more unified presence and greater military ability to effect its policies and desires around the globe ; providing a " balance " to other , currently much more powerful , countries .
however , it takes " vision " to take the second approach .
it takes the ability to see beyond paranoia -lrb- " the moslems are out to get us " -rrb- and fears -lrb- " how will we ever support them all ! " -rrb- .
the eu could " throw " in a " monkey-wrench " of sorts in to the works in the form of " humiliating " demands that would simply derail the whole works .
but it would be too naive to expect the turks to not see such tactics for simply what they are : excuses covering the real reasons behind the rejection . - mustapha stokely , cape girardeau , missouri , usa back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

guthein said he guesses that about half of those customers are german .
" the rest maybe came here on vacation , and in america there are also a lot of soldiers who used to be stationed in germany , " he said .
if guthein had it his way , he would do more business with people outside the united states .
since 2002 , when the food industry bioterrorism act went into effect , he has had to enter a product-by-product listing of the contents of every package onto an online form .
it takes him a half hour to fill out each one .
guthein said he never stops being surprised by what people order from his company .
kinder surprise is old hat , as is german party pumpernickel and baking mix for sprouted spelt bread .
but what is so special about dried mixed herbs , or kaba brand cocoa powder , guthein wondered .
he only put them in his product line after people asked for them .

what promises to give more germans a breath of fresh air has the country of car lovers up in arms . germany is a country of cars .
the automobile industry is famous for its quality products and in particular german men are often accused of loving their cars more than anything else in their lives . a european union directive could put an end to this - or at least hamper this loving relationship . in just a few days , from jan .
1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .
" but all want to ensure as low a threshold of cuts as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new limits stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .
metzger said it was still unclear whether this will lead to a wave of class-action lawsuits . ensuring individual mobility germany ’ s powerful automobile association adac is worried that the new laws could impair mobility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on a highway near munich " all measures against air pollution can only take hold if they also apply to the main sources , " said adac ’ s vice-president for transportation , erhard oehm .
authorities could not put all eggs in one basket . " since cars with gasoline engines hardly and diesel-powered cars only marginally contribute to the emissions , this has to be considered accordingly , " said oehm .
" individual mobility must continue to be ensured by all the measures affecting road traffic . " according to oehm , speed limits were not a viable alternative , as they had in the past hardly led to a decrease in air pollutants .
closing inner cities to traffic should only be considered in extreme situations , he said .
more intelligent traffic control , such as a progressive stoplight system , would be more effective , he said . a viable alternative the background of the eu directive is the simple fact that these particulate materials are harmful to health . " respiratory and cardiovascular diseases can to a high degree be traced back to inhaled fine dust , " trittin said .
" especially in metropolitan areas , hundreds and thousands of people fall ill for this reason every year , and many cases are fatal . " one viable alternative is busses , taxis and cars , which run on natural gas , a possibility also supported by adac .
these vehicles do not pose a problem with respect to particulates or nitrogen oxide .
also , biogenious fuels are exempted from germany ’ s high petroleum tax . according to figures by the federal association of the german gas industry , some 27,000 natural gas vehicles were on german roads in 2004 .
this marked a 40 percent increase to the previous year .
at the same time , the german gas industry opens three new natural gas stations - per week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening traffic in berlin natural gas is one solution to tackle the measures imposed by the eu directive .

1 , the european union ’ s new clean air laws come into effect .
what promises to give more germans a breath of fresh air has the country of car lovers up in arms . germany is a country of cars .
the automobile industry is famous for its quality products and in particular german men are often accused of loving their cars more than anything else in their lives . a european union directive could put an end to this - or at least hamper this loving relationship . in just a few days , from jan .
1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .
" but all want to ensure as low a threshold of cuts as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new limits stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .
metzger said it was still unclear whether this will lead to a wave of class-action lawsuits . ensuring individual mobility germany ’ s powerful automobile association adac is worried that the new laws could impair mobility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on a highway near munich " all measures against air pollution can only take hold if they also apply to the main sources , " said adac ’ s vice-president for transportation , erhard oehm .
authorities could not put all eggs in one basket . " since cars with gasoline engines hardly and diesel-powered cars only marginally contribute to the emissions , this has to be considered accordingly , " said oehm .
" individual mobility must continue to be ensured by all the measures affecting road traffic . " according to oehm , speed limits were not a viable alternative , as they had in the past hardly led to a decrease in air pollutants .
closing inner cities to traffic should only be considered in extreme situations , he said .
more intelligent traffic control , such as a progressive stoplight system , would be more effective , he said . a viable alternative the background of the eu directive is the simple fact that these particulate materials are harmful to health . " respiratory and cardiovascular diseases can to a high degree be traced back to inhaled fine dust , " trittin said .
" especially in metropolitan areas , hundreds and thousands of people fall ill for this reason every year , and many cases are fatal . " one viable alternative is busses , taxis and cars , which run on natural gas , a possibility also supported by adac .
these vehicles do not pose a problem with respect to particulates or nitrogen oxide .
also , biogenious fuels are exempted from germany ’ s high petroleum tax . according to figures by the federal association of the german gas industry , some 27,000 natural gas vehicles were on german roads in 2004 .
this marked a 40 percent increase to the previous year .
at the same time , the german gas industry opens three new natural gas stations - per week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening traffic in berlin natural gas is one solution to tackle the measures imposed by the eu directive .

back to first page back 2/2 german conservatives have turned to colleagues in france for help in blocking turkey 's bid to join the european union .
dw readers weighed in on whether turkey should indeed become part of the bloc .
since turkey is not a european country -lrb- 96 percent of her landmass is geographically in europe and the 4 percent that is is due to an historical fluke -rrb- , it should not be admitted into the eu .
having said that , the eu could sign a free-trade agreement with turkey like it would with any other sovereign nation .
but that should be the extent of the relationship .
and i find it appalling that turkey is seeking to dictate the terms of negotiation .
who does she think she is when she says " we will not accept any other conditions ? "
she is not in any position to insist upon anything .
she wants to join the club , the club does not want her in .
therefore , turkey should either be willing to accept whatever the eu requires or she should stay out .
how badly does she want to join ?
then she needs to start taking responsibility for what she wants .
if she 's not prepared to do so , she should not be allowed to join . - felicity hope , singapore if turkey was not a moslem country i would say " yes , " but with radical islam spreading at an alarming rate , having them in the eu would be like inviting in a " trojan turkey . "
better to wait until the jihad movement has been totally eradicated . - charles reichert , canada i usually encourage stronger relationships between germany and turkey , however after personal experience i can say : a full eu membership for turkey is a huge step -lrb- that -rrb- will cost the eu -lrb- a great -rrb- price !
what should the eu do ?
one , the eu should start long negotiations with the turkish end with a conditional membership to put the eu on the safe side .
two , the eu should try to figure out why turkey needs full eu membership and then try to put more solutions on the table , things the turks ca n't deny . - aiman yunes as a cypriot i am hoping that prime minister erdogan keeps his word .
i understand that he also has tremendous pressure internally , and it wo n't be easy for him to simply dismiss his opponents -lrb- army , right wingers -rrb- by recognizing cyprus .
however , one has to admit that if you do want to be part of a family , you need to be in good standing with all the people in the family .
i would like to see turkey in the eu , because deep down the people are n't bad .
the country 's military , however , used to impose its will over everyone as initially it was the only way to control the diversity in that country .
even though i think it 's a fair deal , it will come down , once again , to how much does erdogan get over the army . - theo theocharides turks tend to be much more moderate in their approach to islam .
the turkish approach to islam in one 's personal life , for example , could be a " role-model " for the other moslem peoples , living currently within the eu .
sure the turkish model of democracy has n't been a smooth one , and they are still " working " things out , but let 's not forget even germany had its hitler , and there 's nothing so bad in the turkish model of democracy that could parallel germany 's hitler or russia 's stalin .
europe faces " roughly " two futures .
the first would leave europe as a largely christian club with economic associations , lacking true diversity and any means of affecting its policies anywhere on the globe .
the second choice would define a much different europe ; one that is both culturally , ethnically diverse and possibly one with a more unified presence and greater military ability to effect its policies and desires around the globe ; providing a " balance " to other , currently much more powerful , countries .
however , it takes " vision " to take the second approach .
it takes the ability to see beyond paranoia -lrb- " the moslems are out to get us " -rrb- and fears -lrb- " how will we ever support them all ! " -rrb- .
the eu could " throw " in a " monkey-wrench " of sorts in to the works in the form of " humiliating " demands that would simply derail the whole works .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . turkey has legislated laws in view of full eu membership and these have been acknowledged on numerous occasions in the conclusions of european council summits .
the 1993 copenhagen criteria is being slowly but steadily met .
the question lies on the grounds whether the eu can manage to include turkey .
if we take into consideration the present 2004 , has the eu digested the new member states ?
should it embark on another huge project of enlargement so fast ?
are religion and cyprus insurmountable issues ?
should the eu step back ?
accession of negotiations should initiate with mutual understanding that it is going to take a long time for the eu to be ready to absorb turkey and for turkey to implement the legislation which it changed over the years .
the issue of recognition of cyprus is to be dealt with right before the start of the talks in order to have it out of the way .
on other issues , it should be treated as other candidates have been treated .
religion is not an issue if it is not mixed up with politics .
france -lrb- for instance -rrb- desires a secular europe and on similar ground , therefore , religion should be left to theologists not to politicians . - joe borg camilleri i believe that conservatives ' views are not in the interest of whole eu .

the exclusion of turkey will further divide the world map based on religion -lrb- and -rrb- create further instability for world peace .
turkish entry to eu will create a dynamic europe economically as well as politically , and cultural exchanges will create new harmony between religions rather than further divide . - dr. guven uzun i urge all germans to recognize the long-term strategic importance to world peace that the entry of turkey into the eu will bring .
the eu talks the talk of tolerance - it 's time for actions to match words .
forcing turkey to recognize cyprus is ill-advised at best at this time .
all people should work to make this union work , not create more obstacles . - blanton ray tayyip erdogan 's comments reveal that turkey has a long way to go before its political culture and institutions are changed to comply with eu norms .
how can the eu admit a country whose laws permit the government to discriminate against and persecute ethnic and religious minorities such as the kurds , greek orthodox , roman catholics and other christians ?
if any other eu country where to have the same legal restrictions on non-christian religious practices and property that turkey currently has on its non-muslim minorities , the world would be outraged .
there is simply no evidence that turkey 's government is willing to allow its non-muslim minorities , such as the greek orthodox , to have the same legal and property rights as muslim citizens . - michael pasquale sasso turkey certainly belongs to europe in a political , military and economical context .
in terms of culture and faith , there is no doubt that turkey is also deeply rooted in the east .
turkey already belongs to the coe , osce , oecd , nato , eea , eu customs union , europol-partnership and many more .
istanbul will host the uefa football champions league finals in 2005 ; ankara is often the main venue for european security and police meetings etc .
most people who strongly oppose turkey have basically never been to the country .
the muslim-dominated identity of turkey should not obstruct ankara 's eu membership process .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . turkey has legislated laws in view of full eu membership and these have been acknowledged on numerous occasions in the conclusions of european council summits .
the 1993 copenhagen criteria is being slowly but steadily met .
the question lies on the grounds whether the eu can manage to include turkey .
if we take into consideration the present 2004 , has the eu digested the new member states ?
should it embark on another huge project of enlargement so fast ?
are religion and cyprus insurmountable issues ?
should the eu step back ?
accession of negotiations should initiate with mutual understanding that it is going to take a long time for the eu to be ready to absorb turkey and for turkey to implement the legislation which it changed over the years .
the issue of recognition of cyprus is to be dealt with right before the start of the talks in order to have it out of the way .
on other issues , it should be treated as other candidates have been treated .
religion is not an issue if it is not mixed up with politics .
france -lrb- for instance -rrb- desires a secular europe and on similar ground , therefore , religion should be left to theologists not to politicians . - joe borg camilleri i believe that conservatives ' views are not in the interest of whole eu .

the exclusion of turkey will further divide the world map based on religion -lrb- and -rrb- create further instability for world peace .
turkish entry to eu will create a dynamic europe economically as well as politically , and cultural exchanges will create new harmony between religions rather than further divide . - dr. guven uzun i urge all germans to recognize the long-term strategic importance to world peace that the entry of turkey into the eu will bring .
the eu talks the talk of tolerance - it 's time for actions to match words .
forcing turkey to recognize cyprus is ill-advised at best at this time .
all people should work to make this union work , not create more obstacles . - blanton ray tayyip erdogan 's comments reveal that turkey has a long way to go before its political culture and institutions are changed to comply with eu norms .
how can the eu admit a country whose laws permit the government to discriminate against and persecute ethnic and religious minorities such as the kurds , greek orthodox , roman catholics and other christians ?

un officials said that the number of dead could reach 80,000 in indonesia alone . in sri lanka , 17,800 people , including at least 70 foreigners , were killed by the tsunamis . the death toll in india crossed 9,000 with many thousands still missing , officials said . the toll includes 4,000 in the andaman and nicobar islands , close to the epicenter of the indonesian earthquake that produced the tsunamis , and another 4,500 in the southern indian state of tamil nadu . more than 1,500 people , among them more than 700 foreign tourists , were killed in southern thailand , officials said .
they feared that most of around 1,500 people still missing were foreign tourists . in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- at least 90 people were killed , according to the united nations , while 65 people were dead in malaysia , officials said . at least 55 people including two british holidaymakers were killed in the tourist paradise of the maldives while another 69 were missing , officials said . fatalities also occurred on the east coast of africa where 100 fishermen were declared dead in somalia , 10 in tanzania and one in kenya . new threat from disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist monk looks at bodies of victims of the waves and floods in a temple in southern thailand experts warned that disease could multiply the horror of asia 's tsunami catastrophe , pushing estimates of the final toll to over 100,000 as the world 's biggest ever relief operation stuttered into life against enormous odds wednesday . " there is a chance that we could have at least as many dying from communicable diseases as we had dying from the tsunami , " said david nabarro , the top official at the world health organization dealing with humanitarian crises . the task of preventing this second wave of suffering is unprecedented , with un disaster relief coordinator jan egeland saying relief operations would be the biggest in history . while the aid organizations made their plans and governments around the world pledged cash and dispatched ships and aircraft to help , the millions of bereaved and homeless faced a seemingly hopeless task of rebuilding shattered lives amidst utter chaos . miracles among the horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors from the swiss humanitarian aid unit take inventory of emergency supplies after arriving at the phuket international airport , wednesday , dec .
29 , 2004 , in phuket thailand there were stories of miraculous escapes , such as that of a 13-year-old girl who survived after spending two days clinging to a wooden door in the indian ocean after being swept off a remote island . but there were far more stories of unspeakable horror , with mass burials underway everywhere accompanied by huge outpourings of grief from people who had lost their entire families , homes and livelihoods . in indonesia 's aceh province , fast emerging as the quake 's ground zero , survivors scrabbled for food among mud and corpses .
great tracts of land remain under surging waters and there has been no word from many isolated communities . the first shipments of international aid arrived in the city of banda aceh , 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,200 miles -rrb- northwest of jakarta on wednesday , but with no trucks or fuel to distribute it , starvation loomed for thousands . throughout the region , hundreds of rescue ships , helicopters and planes were mobilized on relief missions . asian stock markets hitting highs in a sign of the brutal disconnect between investors and the poor who suffered the tragedy , however , indonesian and indian stock markets were hitting record highs on perceived economic good times . for investors , the headline figure since sunday has not been the catastrophic death toll in remote stretches of the indian ocean among people who were hardly movers and shakers in the global economy . instead , the business community has paid more attention to studies that foreign insurance firms were largely unscathed by the killer waves and that major tour operators have been forced to re-route holidaymakers . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder expects hundreds of dead the german foreign office predicts that the number of germans dead or missing following the asian tsunamis will be in the hundreds .

as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .
no one knows for sure which of two skulls belonged to the 18th century poet though dna analysis could resolve it . one skull rests in an ornate oak coffin next to that of schiller 's friend and fellow poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , in the weimar ducal vault .
the other sits in an unmarked , inconspicuous casket .
experts bicker over which skull was schiller 's . although dna analysis would likely clear up the confusion , the weimar classics foundation , which oversees schiller and goethe memorial sites in the eastern german state of thuringia , has shown no interest in resolving the issue . " no investigations are planned , " spokeswoman angela jahn told bild daily .
" that would n't change anything anyway .
we need a comparative value for an analysis , but a hair , for example , could also not be genuine . " actually , any material upon which schiller 's dna traces have been preserved would suffice , whether from his clothing or from a descendent , anthropologist ursula wittwer-backofen told the associated press .
mixed-up exhumation ? schiller 's body was buried in a mass grave in weimar on the night of his death on may 11 , 1805 .
but it had n't found its final resting place .
schiller 's widow intended her husband be buried in an individual grave . still , the plot was n't re-opened until 1826 , by which time the coffins had burst and the bodies had decomposed .
weimar mayor karl leberecht schwabe set up the 23 recovered skulls on a table , pointed to the largest one and declared , " that must be schiller 's skull . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller statue in weimar half a year later , goethe collected the skull , which he kept on blue velvet cushion underneath a bell jar .
since december 1827 the skull and other bones attributed to schiller have rested in the oak coffin in weimar 's ducal vault . hermann welcker was the first to call the skull 's authenticity into question , in 1883 .
although experts agreed with the anatomist , laymen were outraged .
finally , in 1911 , another exhumation of the mass grave brought forth 63 additional skulls , one of which was said to be schiller 's , according to göttingen philologist albrecht schöne , who wrote a book about the mix-up .
the second skull was moved to the weimer ducal vault in 1914 . " it would certainly be embarrassing for the -lrb- weimar classics -rrb- foundation , if both skulls were proven to be false , " schöne said . besides , the foundation is likely more concerned with the restoration of the 16th-18th century books from the anna amalia library - which was badly damaged by fire in september - than with resolving the skull question . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .
no one knows for sure which of two skulls belonged to the 18th century poet though dna analysis could resolve it . one skull rests in an ornate oak coffin next to that of schiller 's friend and fellow poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , in the weimar ducal vault .
the other sits in an unmarked , inconspicuous casket .
experts bicker over which skull was schiller 's . although dna analysis would likely clear up the confusion , the weimar classics foundation , which oversees schiller and goethe memorial sites in the eastern german state of thuringia , has shown no interest in resolving the issue . " no investigations are planned , " spokeswoman angela jahn told bild daily .
" that would n't change anything anyway .
we need a comparative value for an analysis , but a hair , for example , could also not be genuine . " actually , any material upon which schiller 's dna traces have been preserved would suffice , whether from his clothing or from a descendent , anthropologist ursula wittwer-backofen told the associated press .
mixed-up exhumation ? schiller 's body was buried in a mass grave in weimar on the night of his death on may 11 , 1805 .
but it had n't found its final resting place .
schiller 's widow intended her husband be buried in an individual grave . still , the plot was n't re-opened until 1826 , by which time the coffins had burst and the bodies had decomposed .
weimar mayor karl leberecht schwabe set up the 23 recovered skulls on a table , pointed to the largest one and declared , " that must be schiller 's skull . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller statue in weimar half a year later , goethe collected the skull , which he kept on blue velvet cushion underneath a bell jar .
since december 1827 the skull and other bones attributed to schiller have rested in the oak coffin in weimar 's ducal vault . hermann welcker was the first to call the skull 's authenticity into question , in 1883 .
although experts agreed with the anatomist , laymen were outraged .
finally , in 1911 , another exhumation of the mass grave brought forth 63 additional skulls , one of which was said to be schiller 's , according to göttingen philologist albrecht schöne , who wrote a book about the mix-up .
the second skull was moved to the weimer ducal vault in 1914 . " it would certainly be embarrassing for the -lrb- weimar classics -rrb- foundation , if both skulls were proven to be false , " schöne said . besides , the foundation is likely more concerned with the restoration of the 16th-18th century books from the anna amalia library - which was badly damaged by fire in september - than with resolving the skull question . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

dw-world readers express their opinions on whether that could have reduced the huge death toll . the following comments reflect a cross-section of the views of our readers as received so far .
if you would like to have your say on this or another issue , please click on our feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be automatically published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i think that the claim that no one was available to initiate early warning measures is quite absurd and objectionable indeed .
in this age of internet and mobile telephones , one could have at least contacted some offices like the prime minister 's office or some other places like tv stations .
at least some lives would have been saved .
of course , one never expects such events especially when something like this has never happened before in recorded history .
it is quite objectionable and disgusting to think how scientists from western countries can be so oblivious to the fate of thousands of people in asia .
is it just because they are " asians ? "
at least now one knows that the perception of the west has still not changed - venkatesh ramakrishnan it is quite evident to save many more if we had a warning .
take the earthquake at california - it was a huge one , but they were prepared for it and hence they were able to save more lives .
if we had an early warning we could have saved many more probably , cleared the whole area .
but it is quite evident that india does n't concentrate much on technology and research and today we paid the price for it .
not only should they have warning systems in the sea but wo n't satellites get photos of the sea and report them quickly ? - joshua daniel yes , i think an early warning would have saved some lives .
but , these kind of disasters are very , very rare in this region .
in addition , it being a sunday and in the early morning , the government machinery also could not do any thing as there is no system to reach and alert living along the sea coasts . - k venkat narayana firstly , it is quite impossible to predict a tsunami or an earthquake as there is no scientific tool that can predict these .
tsunamis may be predicted by the measurement of tidal water flow , but even then we would have very little time to warn people because we would need to do so along the entire coast , which is more than a few kilometers long .
is it possible to warn all the people ?
we could have probably managed to save 500 people among 20,000 people .
yes , i know that one life is a life , i want to say till now we do n't have any tool that can save people from such natural calamities . - amit kumar mondal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

the country 's economy continued to take a beating , with its envied welfare state under siege and its once-untouchable auto industry feeling the pinch . immigration and integration were topics very much on everyone 's mind , with their shadow story , terrorism , never far behind .
in the wake of the abu ghraib scandal , the bundeswehr made headlines when it turned out to have a few bad apples of its own .
and the united states renewed the contract of the leader of the free world - to the great disappointment of most germans .
on a different note , michael schumacher continued to rock formula 1 , paintings from new york 's moma kept berliners up all night , and the most gruesome trial in recent german history kept the tabloids flying off the stands .

on jan .
1 , the european union ’ s new clean air laws come into effect .
what promises to give more germans a breath of fresh air has the country of car lovers up in arms . germany is a country of cars .
the automobile industry is famous for its quality products and in particular german men are often accused of loving their cars more than anything else in their lives . a european union directive could put an end to this - or at least hamper this loving relationship . in just a few days , from jan .
1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .
" but all want to ensure as low a threshold of cuts as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new limits stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .
metzger said it was still unclear whether this will lead to a wave of class-action lawsuits . ensuring individual mobility germany ’ s powerful automobile association adac is worried that the new laws could impair mobility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on a highway near munich " all measures against air pollution can only take hold if they also apply to the main sources , " said adac ’ s vice-president for transportation , erhard oehm .
authorities could not put all eggs in one basket . " since cars with gasoline engines hardly and diesel-powered cars only marginally contribute to the emissions , this has to be considered accordingly , " said oehm .
" individual mobility must continue to be ensured by all the measures affecting road traffic . " according to oehm , speed limits were not a viable alternative , as they had in the past hardly led to a decrease in air pollutants .
closing inner cities to traffic should only be considered in extreme situations , he said .
more intelligent traffic control , such as a progressive stoplight system , would be more effective , he said . a viable alternative the background of the eu directive is the simple fact that these particulate materials are harmful to health . " respiratory and cardiovascular diseases can to a high degree be traced back to inhaled fine dust , " trittin said .
" especially in metropolitan areas , hundreds and thousands of people fall ill for this reason every year , and many cases are fatal . " one viable alternative is busses , taxis and cars , which run on natural gas , a possibility also supported by adac .
these vehicles do not pose a problem with respect to particulates or nitrogen oxide .
also , biogenious fuels are exempted from germany ’ s high petroleum tax . according to figures by the federal association of the german gas industry , some 27,000 natural gas vehicles were on german roads in 2004 .
this marked a 40 percent increase to the previous year .
at the same time , the german gas industry opens three new natural gas stations - per week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening traffic in berlin natural gas is one solution to tackle the measures imposed by the eu directive .
the next obstacle approaches , though .
in 2010 , strict emission limits for nitrogen oxides , a pollutant emitted primarily by cars and trucks and a precursor to ozone , come into effect .
then , german drivers will face even more restrictions in their loving relationships to their cars . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de future looks dark for germany 's black forest germany 's best-known tourist attraction , the black forest , may be losing some of its luxuriance as a new environmental report warns of dire damage in the region wrought by pollution .

what promises to give more germans a breath of fresh air has the country of car lovers up in arms . germany is a country of cars .

1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .
" but all want to ensure as low a threshold of cuts as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new limits stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .

" individual mobility must continue to be ensured by all the measures affecting road traffic . " according to oehm , speed limits were not a viable alternative , as they had in the past hardly led to a decrease in air pollutants .
closing inner cities to traffic should only be considered in extreme situations , he said .
more intelligent traffic control , such as a progressive stoplight system , would be more effective , he said . a viable alternative the background of the eu directive is the simple fact that these particulate materials are harmful to health . " respiratory and cardiovascular diseases can to a high degree be traced back to inhaled fine dust , " trittin said .
" especially in metropolitan areas , hundreds and thousands of people fall ill for this reason every year , and many cases are fatal . " one viable alternative is busses , taxis and cars , which run on natural gas , a possibility also supported by adac .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.12.2004 mail order firm ships a taste of home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " eggs " that started it all a newspaper article about a grandma with a record of smuggling gave one enterprising german an idea for a business whose time had come : shipping typical foods to his countrymen abroad . ask most germans living abroad what they miss most about their homeland , and the answer is n't likely to be " the weather . "
it might , however , be " bread . "
or chocolate , honey , mashed potatoes , or mustard .
indeed , as some entrepreneurs have discovered , however well germans living abroad may adjust to their new country , they rarely lose the longing for those edible things they grew up with .
for norbert gutheins of kleinmanchow , in brandenburg - a town known , incidentally , for its typically german sweet mustard - it all started with a newspaper article about an american oma with a criminal streak .
the granny would smuggle popular german treats known as kinderüberraschung , or kinder surprise , to her grandson in america .
shipping allowed strict american food laws forbid the sale of the hollow chocolate eggs , which contain small plastic toys inside .
but while they could not be purchased in the united states at the time , shipping them into the country is not illegal .
from the initial idea of sending kinder surprise overseas , it was a small step to a more general concept : a mail order company that ships german food products anywhere in the world .
chocolate and sauerkraut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guglhupf bakery in durham today , gutheins works out of the basement of his kleinmanchow home , packing the orders that he picks from his internet site .
he sends chocolate to brazil , sauerkraut to finland , and yes , kinder surprise to america , even though stores there now sell the eggs as well .
he ships to wherever germans live - or at least to wherever someone lives who is desperate for a taste of german coffee or haribo gummy bears .
while gutheins managed to share the taste of the homeland from his own back yard , other germans have taken a different route .
hartmut jahn is the owner of the guglhupf bakery , in durham , north carolina .
durham is in an area known as the research triangle , known for its many universities and biotech firms .
the area has a strong international population , among which are a lot of germans .
many of them have never grown to appreciate the soft , packaged white bread found on american supermarket shelves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german loaves a few years ago , jahn and his then-partner claudia cooper decided they wanted to give up their jobs at a munich computer firm .
cooper had studied in the united states , and had realized that above all , germans living in america missed their beloved bread .
she quit her job , spent two years at a traditional munich bakery learning the trade , and together with jahn , opened up the durham shop .
stollen for america " we had just one shot at success , " cooper said .
" we did n't have enough money for second chances . "
in the beginning , there were 16-hour days among the mixers , ovens and flour dust .
as a result , the relationship hit the skids - but the bakery flourished .
their nut-buns , sesame rolls , and traditional german whole-grain breads are hot items in the research triangle .
their christmas stollen gets sent to germans across the country .
amid all the fine baking , jahn seems to think kinder surprise would be out of place .
" we would n't sell them even if we were allowed to , " he said .
" we have an upscale clientele . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical german breakfast still , the eggs are an item on norbert guthein 's inventory , and they regularly get sent to us customers .
guthein said he guesses that about half of those customers are german .
" the rest maybe came here on vacation , and in america there are also a lot of soldiers who used to be stationed in germany , " he said .
if guthein had it his way , he would do more business with people outside the united states .
since 2002 , when the food industry bioterrorism act went into effect , he has had to enter a product-by-product listing of the contents of every package onto an online form .
it takes him a half hour to fill out each one .
guthein said he never stops being surprised by what people order from his company .
kinder surprise is old hat , as is german party pumpernickel and baking mix for sprouted spelt bread .
but what is so special about dried mixed herbs , or kaba brand cocoa powder , guthein wondered .
he only put them in his product line after people asked for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it probably has to do with being homesick for everyday things , " he said .
that way , the steaming cup of cocoa will taste just like it did way back when .
or the prickel-pit fizzy candy will take you back to your childhood .
so , what is the worst thing he has ever had to mail abroad ?
a shipment of instant spaghetti dinners , by the timeworn german brand miracoli , guthein said .
the instant pasta-and-tomato sauce mixes were shipped to a german - in italy . kerstin hilt -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

"
it might , however , be " bread . "
or chocolate , honey , mashed potatoes , or mustard .
indeed , as some entrepreneurs have discovered , however well germans living abroad may adjust to their new country , they rarely lose the longing for those edible things they grew up with .
for norbert gutheins of kleinmanchow , in brandenburg - a town known , incidentally , for its typically german sweet mustard - it all started with a newspaper article about an american oma with a criminal streak .
the granny would smuggle popular german treats known as kinderüberraschung , or kinder surprise , to her grandson in america .
shipping allowed strict american food laws forbid the sale of the hollow chocolate eggs , which contain small plastic toys inside .
but while they could not be purchased in the united states at the time , shipping them into the country is not illegal .
from the initial idea of sending kinder surprise overseas , it was a small step to a more general concept : a mail order company that ships german food products anywhere in the world .
chocolate and sauerkraut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guglhupf bakery in durham today , gutheins works out of the basement of his kleinmanchow home , packing the orders that he picks from his internet site .
he sends chocolate to brazil , sauerkraut to finland , and yes , kinder surprise to america , even though stores there now sell the eggs as well .
he ships to wherever germans live - or at least to wherever someone lives who is desperate for a taste of german coffee or haribo gummy bears .
while gutheins managed to share the taste of the homeland from his own back yard , other germans have taken a different route .
hartmut jahn is the owner of the guglhupf bakery , in durham , north carolina .
durham is in an area known as the research triangle , known for its many universities and biotech firms .
the area has a strong international population , among which are a lot of germans .
many of them have never grown to appreciate the soft , packaged white bread found on american supermarket shelves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german loaves a few years ago , jahn and his then-partner claudia cooper decided they wanted to give up their jobs at a munich computer firm .
cooper had studied in the united states , and had realized that above all , germans living in america missed their beloved bread .
she quit her job , spent two years at a traditional munich bakery learning the trade , and together with jahn , opened up the durham shop .
stollen for america " we had just one shot at success , " cooper said .
" we did n't have enough money for second chances . "
in the beginning , there were 16-hour days among the mixers , ovens and flour dust .
as a result , the relationship hit the skids - but the bakery flourished .
their nut-buns , sesame rolls , and traditional german whole-grain breads are hot items in the research triangle .
their christmas stollen gets sent to germans across the country .
amid all the fine baking , jahn seems to think kinder surprise would be out of place .
" we would n't sell them even if we were allowed to , " he said .
" we have an upscale clientele . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical german breakfast still , the eggs are an item on norbert guthein 's inventory , and they regularly get sent to us customers .
guthein said he guesses that about half of those customers are german .
" the rest maybe came here on vacation , and in america there are also a lot of soldiers who used to be stationed in germany , " he said .
if guthein had it his way , he would do more business with people outside the united states .
since 2002 , when the food industry bioterrorism act went into effect , he has had to enter a product-by-product listing of the contents of every package onto an online form .
it takes him a half hour to fill out each one .
guthein said he never stops being surprised by what people order from his company .
kinder surprise is old hat , as is german party pumpernickel and baking mix for sprouted spelt bread .
but what is so special about dried mixed herbs , or kaba brand cocoa powder , guthein wondered .
he only put them in his product line after people asked for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it probably has to do with being homesick for everyday things , " he said .
that way , the steaming cup of cocoa will taste just like it did way back when .
or the prickel-pit fizzy candy will take you back to your childhood .
so , what is the worst thing he has ever had to mail abroad ?
a shipment of instant spaghetti dinners , by the timeworn german brand miracoli , guthein said .
the instant pasta-and-tomato sauce mixes were shipped to a german - in italy . kerstin hilt -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

back to first page back 2/2 german conservatives have turned to colleagues in france for help in blocking turkey 's bid to join the european union .
dw readers weighed in on whether turkey should indeed become part of the bloc .
since turkey is not a european country -lrb- 96 percent of her landmass is geographically in europe and the 4 percent that is is due to an historical fluke -rrb- , it should not be admitted into the eu .
having said that , the eu could sign a free-trade agreement with turkey like it would with any other sovereign nation .
but that should be the extent of the relationship .
and i find it appalling that turkey is seeking to dictate the terms of negotiation .
who does she think she is when she says " we will not accept any other conditions ? "
she is not in any position to insist upon anything .
she wants to join the club , the club does not want her in .
therefore , turkey should either be willing to accept whatever the eu requires or she should stay out .
how badly does she want to join ?
then she needs to start taking responsibility for what she wants .
if she 's not prepared to do so , she should not be allowed to join . - felicity hope , singapore if turkey was not a moslem country i would say " yes , " but with radical islam spreading at an alarming rate , having them in the eu would be like inviting in a " trojan turkey . "
better to wait until the jihad movement has been totally eradicated . - charles reichert , canada i usually encourage stronger relationships between germany and turkey , however after personal experience i can say : a full eu membership for turkey is a huge step -lrb- that -rrb- will cost the eu -lrb- a great -rrb- price !
what should the eu do ?
one , the eu should start long negotiations with the turkish end with a conditional membership to put the eu on the safe side .
two , the eu should try to figure out why turkey needs full eu membership and then try to put more solutions on the table , things the turks ca n't deny . - aiman yunes as a cypriot i am hoping that prime minister erdogan keeps his word .
i understand that he also has tremendous pressure internally , and it wo n't be easy for him to simply dismiss his opponents -lrb- army , right wingers -rrb- by recognizing cyprus .
however , one has to admit that if you do want to be part of a family , you need to be in good standing with all the people in the family .
i would like to see turkey in the eu , because deep down the people are n't bad .
the country 's military , however , used to impose its will over everyone as initially it was the only way to control the diversity in that country .
even though i think it 's a fair deal , it will come down , once again , to how much does erdogan get over the army . - theo theocharides turks tend to be much more moderate in their approach to islam .
the turkish approach to islam in one 's personal life , for example , could be a " role-model " for the other moslem peoples , living currently within the eu .
sure the turkish model of democracy has n't been a smooth one , and they are still " working " things out , but let 's not forget even germany had its hitler , and there 's nothing so bad in the turkish model of democracy that could parallel germany 's hitler or russia 's stalin .
europe faces " roughly " two futures .
the first would leave europe as a largely christian club with economic associations , lacking true diversity and any means of affecting its policies anywhere on the globe .
the second choice would define a much different europe ; one that is both culturally , ethnically diverse and possibly one with a more unified presence and greater military ability to effect its policies and desires around the globe ; providing a " balance " to other , currently much more powerful , countries .
however , it takes " vision " to take the second approach .
it takes the ability to see beyond paranoia -lrb- " the moslems are out to get us " -rrb- and fears -lrb- " how will we ever support them all ! " -rrb- .
the eu could " throw " in a " monkey-wrench " of sorts in to the works in the form of " humiliating " demands that would simply derail the whole works .
but it would be too naive to expect the turks to not see such tactics for simply what they are : excuses covering the real reasons behind the rejection . - mustapha stokely , cape girardeau , missouri , usa back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

un officials said that the number of dead could reach 80,000 in indonesia alone . in sri lanka , 17,800 people , including at least 70 foreigners , were killed by the tsunamis . the death toll in india crossed 9,000 with many thousands still missing , officials said . the toll includes 4,000 in the andaman and nicobar islands , close to the epicenter of the indonesian earthquake that produced the tsunamis , and another 4,500 in the southern indian state of tamil nadu . more than 1,500 people , among them more than 700 foreign tourists , were killed in southern thailand , officials said .
they feared that most of around 1,500 people still missing were foreign tourists . in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- at least 90 people were killed , according to the united nations , while 65 people were dead in malaysia , officials said . at least 55 people including two british holidaymakers were killed in the tourist paradise of the maldives while another 69 were missing , officials said . fatalities also occurred on the east coast of africa where 100 fishermen were declared dead in somalia , 10 in tanzania and one in kenya . new threat from disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist monk looks at bodies of victims of the waves and floods in a temple in southern thailand experts warned that disease could multiply the horror of asia 's tsunami catastrophe , pushing estimates of the final toll to over 100,000 as the world 's biggest ever relief operation stuttered into life against enormous odds wednesday . " there is a chance that we could have at least as many dying from communicable diseases as we had dying from the tsunami , " said david nabarro , the top official at the world health organization dealing with humanitarian crises . the task of preventing this second wave of suffering is unprecedented , with un disaster relief coordinator jan egeland saying relief operations would be the biggest in history . while the aid organizations made their plans and governments around the world pledged cash and dispatched ships and aircraft to help , the millions of bereaved and homeless faced a seemingly hopeless task of rebuilding shattered lives amidst utter chaos . miracles among the horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors from the swiss humanitarian aid unit take inventory of emergency supplies after arriving at the phuket international airport , wednesday , dec .
29 , 2004 , in phuket thailand there were stories of miraculous escapes , such as that of a 13-year-old girl who survived after spending two days clinging to a wooden door in the indian ocean after being swept off a remote island . but there were far more stories of unspeakable horror , with mass burials underway everywhere accompanied by huge outpourings of grief from people who had lost their entire families , homes and livelihoods . in indonesia 's aceh province , fast emerging as the quake 's ground zero , survivors scrabbled for food among mud and corpses .
great tracts of land remain under surging waters and there has been no word from many isolated communities . the first shipments of international aid arrived in the city of banda aceh , 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,200 miles -rrb- northwest of jakarta on wednesday , but with no trucks or fuel to distribute it , starvation loomed for thousands . throughout the region , hundreds of rescue ships , helicopters and planes were mobilized on relief missions . asian stock markets hitting highs in a sign of the brutal disconnect between investors and the poor who suffered the tragedy , however , indonesian and indian stock markets were hitting record highs on perceived economic good times . for investors , the headline figure since sunday has not been the catastrophic death toll in remote stretches of the indian ocean among people who were hardly movers and shakers in the global economy . instead , the business community has paid more attention to studies that foreign insurance firms were largely unscathed by the killer waves and that major tour operators have been forced to re-route holidaymakers . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder expects hundreds of dead the german foreign office predicts that the number of germans dead or missing following the asian tsunamis will be in the hundreds .

on jan .
1 , the european union ’ s new clean air laws come into effect .
what promises to give more germans a breath of fresh air has the country of car lovers up in arms . germany is a country of cars .
the automobile industry is famous for its quality products and in particular german men are often accused of loving their cars more than anything else in their lives . a european union directive could put an end to this - or at least hamper this loving relationship . in just a few days , from jan .
1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .
" but all want to ensure as low a threshold of cuts as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new limits stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .
metzger said it was still unclear whether this will lead to a wave of class-action lawsuits . ensuring individual mobility germany ’ s powerful automobile association adac is worried that the new laws could impair mobility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on a highway near munich " all measures against air pollution can only take hold if they also apply to the main sources , " said adac ’ s vice-president for transportation , erhard oehm .
authorities could not put all eggs in one basket . " since cars with gasoline engines hardly and diesel-powered cars only marginally contribute to the emissions , this has to be considered accordingly , " said oehm .
" individual mobility must continue to be ensured by all the measures affecting road traffic . " according to oehm , speed limits were not a viable alternative , as they had in the past hardly led to a decrease in air pollutants .
closing inner cities to traffic should only be considered in extreme situations , he said .
more intelligent traffic control , such as a progressive stoplight system , would be more effective , he said . a viable alternative the background of the eu directive is the simple fact that these particulate materials are harmful to health . " respiratory and cardiovascular diseases can to a high degree be traced back to inhaled fine dust , " trittin said .
" especially in metropolitan areas , hundreds and thousands of people fall ill for this reason every year , and many cases are fatal . " one viable alternative is busses , taxis and cars , which run on natural gas , a possibility also supported by adac .
these vehicles do not pose a problem with respect to particulates or nitrogen oxide .
also , biogenious fuels are exempted from germany ’ s high petroleum tax . according to figures by the federal association of the german gas industry , some 27,000 natural gas vehicles were on german roads in 2004 .
this marked a 40 percent increase to the previous year .
at the same time , the german gas industry opens three new natural gas stations - per week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening traffic in berlin natural gas is one solution to tackle the measures imposed by the eu directive .
the next obstacle approaches , though .
in 2010 , strict emission limits for nitrogen oxides , a pollutant emitted primarily by cars and trucks and a precursor to ozone , come into effect .
then , german drivers will face even more restrictions in their loving relationships to their cars . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de future looks dark for germany 's black forest germany 's best-known tourist attraction , the black forest , may be losing some of its luxuriance as a new environmental report warns of dire damage in the region wrought by pollution .

1 , the european union ’ s new clean air laws come into effect .
what promises to give more germans a breath of fresh air has the country of car lovers up in arms . germany is a country of cars .
the automobile industry is famous for its quality products and in particular german men are often accused of loving their cars more than anything else in their lives . a european union directive could put an end to this - or at least hamper this loving relationship . in just a few days , from jan .
1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .
" but all want to ensure as low a threshold of cuts as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new limits stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .
metzger said it was still unclear whether this will lead to a wave of class-action lawsuits . ensuring individual mobility germany ’ s powerful automobile association adac is worried that the new laws could impair mobility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on a highway near munich " all measures against air pollution can only take hold if they also apply to the main sources , " said adac ’ s vice-president for transportation , erhard oehm .
authorities could not put all eggs in one basket . " since cars with gasoline engines hardly and diesel-powered cars only marginally contribute to the emissions , this has to be considered accordingly , " said oehm .
" individual mobility must continue to be ensured by all the measures affecting road traffic . " according to oehm , speed limits were not a viable alternative , as they had in the past hardly led to a decrease in air pollutants .
closing inner cities to traffic should only be considered in extreme situations , he said .
more intelligent traffic control , such as a progressive stoplight system , would be more effective , he said . a viable alternative the background of the eu directive is the simple fact that these particulate materials are harmful to health . " respiratory and cardiovascular diseases can to a high degree be traced back to inhaled fine dust , " trittin said .
" especially in metropolitan areas , hundreds and thousands of people fall ill for this reason every year , and many cases are fatal . " one viable alternative is busses , taxis and cars , which run on natural gas , a possibility also supported by adac .
these vehicles do not pose a problem with respect to particulates or nitrogen oxide .
also , biogenious fuels are exempted from germany ’ s high petroleum tax . according to figures by the federal association of the german gas industry , some 27,000 natural gas vehicles were on german roads in 2004 .
this marked a 40 percent increase to the previous year .
at the same time , the german gas industry opens three new natural gas stations - per week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening traffic in berlin natural gas is one solution to tackle the measures imposed by the eu directive .
the next obstacle approaches , though .
in 2010 , strict emission limits for nitrogen oxides , a pollutant emitted primarily by cars and trucks and a precursor to ozone , come into effect .

on jan .
1 , the european union ’ s new clean air laws come into effect .
what promises to give more germans a breath of fresh air has the country of car lovers up in arms . germany is a country of cars .
the automobile industry is famous for its quality products and in particular german men are often accused of loving their cars more than anything else in their lives . a european union directive could put an end to this - or at least hamper this loving relationship . in just a few days , from jan .
1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .
" but all want to ensure as low a threshold of cuts as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new limits stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .
metzger said it was still unclear whether this will lead to a wave of class-action lawsuits . ensuring individual mobility germany ’ s powerful automobile association adac is worried that the new laws could impair mobility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on a highway near munich " all measures against air pollution can only take hold if they also apply to the main sources , " said adac ’ s vice-president for transportation , erhard oehm .
authorities could not put all eggs in one basket . " since cars with gasoline engines hardly and diesel-powered cars only marginally contribute to the emissions , this has to be considered accordingly , " said oehm .
" individual mobility must continue to be ensured by all the measures affecting road traffic . " according to oehm , speed limits were not a viable alternative , as they had in the past hardly led to a decrease in air pollutants .
closing inner cities to traffic should only be considered in extreme situations , he said .
more intelligent traffic control , such as a progressive stoplight system , would be more effective , he said . a viable alternative the background of the eu directive is the simple fact that these particulate materials are harmful to health . " respiratory and cardiovascular diseases can to a high degree be traced back to inhaled fine dust , " trittin said .
" especially in metropolitan areas , hundreds and thousands of people fall ill for this reason every year , and many cases are fatal . " one viable alternative is busses , taxis and cars , which run on natural gas , a possibility also supported by adac .
these vehicles do not pose a problem with respect to particulates or nitrogen oxide .
also , biogenious fuels are exempted from germany ’ s high petroleum tax . according to figures by the federal association of the german gas industry , some 27,000 natural gas vehicles were on german roads in 2004 .
this marked a 40 percent increase to the previous year .
at the same time , the german gas industry opens three new natural gas stations - per week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening traffic in berlin natural gas is one solution to tackle the measures imposed by the eu directive .
the next obstacle approaches , though .
in 2010 , strict emission limits for nitrogen oxides , a pollutant emitted primarily by cars and trucks and a precursor to ozone , come into effect .
then , german drivers will face even more restrictions in their loving relationships to their cars . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de future looks dark for germany 's black forest germany 's best-known tourist attraction , the black forest , may be losing some of its luxuriance as a new environmental report warns of dire damage in the region wrought by pollution .

the country 's economy continued to take a beating , with its envied welfare state under siege and its once-untouchable auto industry feeling the pinch . immigration and integration were topics very much on everyone 's mind , with their shadow story , terrorism , never far behind .

and the united states renewed the contract of the leader of the free world - to the great disappointment of most germans .

as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .
no one knows for sure which of two skulls belonged to the 18th century poet though dna analysis could resolve it . one skull rests in an ornate oak coffin next to that of schiller 's friend and fellow poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , in the weimar ducal vault .
the other sits in an unmarked , inconspicuous casket .
experts bicker over which skull was schiller 's . although dna analysis would likely clear up the confusion , the weimar classics foundation , which oversees schiller and goethe memorial sites in the eastern german state of thuringia , has shown no interest in resolving the issue . " no investigations are planned , " spokeswoman angela jahn told bild daily .
" that would n't change anything anyway .
we need a comparative value for an analysis , but a hair , for example , could also not be genuine . " actually , any material upon which schiller 's dna traces have been preserved would suffice , whether from his clothing or from a descendent , anthropologist ursula wittwer-backofen told the associated press .
mixed-up exhumation ? schiller 's body was buried in a mass grave in weimar on the night of his death on may 11 , 1805 .
but it had n't found its final resting place .
schiller 's widow intended her husband be buried in an individual grave . still , the plot was n't re-opened until 1826 , by which time the coffins had burst and the bodies had decomposed .
weimar mayor karl leberecht schwabe set up the 23 recovered skulls on a table , pointed to the largest one and declared , " that must be schiller 's skull . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller statue in weimar half a year later , goethe collected the skull , which he kept on blue velvet cushion underneath a bell jar .
since december 1827 the skull and other bones attributed to schiller have rested in the oak coffin in weimar 's ducal vault . hermann welcker was the first to call the skull 's authenticity into question , in 1883 .
although experts agreed with the anatomist , laymen were outraged .
finally , in 1911 , another exhumation of the mass grave brought forth 63 additional skulls , one of which was said to be schiller 's , according to göttingen philologist albrecht schöne , who wrote a book about the mix-up .
the second skull was moved to the weimer ducal vault in 1914 . " it would certainly be embarrassing for the -lrb- weimar classics -rrb- foundation , if both skulls were proven to be false , " schöne said . besides , the foundation is likely more concerned with the restoration of the 16th-18th century books from the anna amalia library - which was badly damaged by fire in september - than with resolving the skull question . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .
no one knows for sure which of two skulls belonged to the 18th century poet though dna analysis could resolve it . one skull rests in an ornate oak coffin next to that of schiller 's friend and fellow poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , in the weimar ducal vault .
the other sits in an unmarked , inconspicuous casket .
experts bicker over which skull was schiller 's . although dna analysis would likely clear up the confusion , the weimar classics foundation , which oversees schiller and goethe memorial sites in the eastern german state of thuringia , has shown no interest in resolving the issue . " no investigations are planned , " spokeswoman angela jahn told bild daily .
" that would n't change anything anyway .
we need a comparative value for an analysis , but a hair , for example , could also not be genuine . " actually , any material upon which schiller 's dna traces have been preserved would suffice , whether from his clothing or from a descendent , anthropologist ursula wittwer-backofen told the associated press .
mixed-up exhumation ? schiller 's body was buried in a mass grave in weimar on the night of his death on may 11 , 1805 .
but it had n't found its final resting place .
schiller 's widow intended her husband be buried in an individual grave . still , the plot was n't re-opened until 1826 , by which time the coffins had burst and the bodies had decomposed .
weimar mayor karl leberecht schwabe set up the 23 recovered skulls on a table , pointed to the largest one and declared , " that must be schiller 's skull . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller statue in weimar half a year later , goethe collected the skull , which he kept on blue velvet cushion underneath a bell jar .
since december 1827 the skull and other bones attributed to schiller have rested in the oak coffin in weimar 's ducal vault . hermann welcker was the first to call the skull 's authenticity into question , in 1883 .
although experts agreed with the anatomist , laymen were outraged .
finally , in 1911 , another exhumation of the mass grave brought forth 63 additional skulls , one of which was said to be schiller 's , according to göttingen philologist albrecht schöne , who wrote a book about the mix-up .
the second skull was moved to the weimer ducal vault in 1914 . " it would certainly be embarrassing for the -lrb- weimar classics -rrb- foundation , if both skulls were proven to be false , " schöne said . besides , the foundation is likely more concerned with the restoration of the 16th-18th century books from the anna amalia library - which was badly damaged by fire in september - than with resolving the skull question . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

un officials said that the number of dead could reach 80,000 in indonesia alone . in sri lanka , 17,800 people , including at least 70 foreigners , were killed by the tsunamis . the death toll in india crossed 9,000 with many thousands still missing , officials said . the toll includes 4,000 in the andaman and nicobar islands , close to the epicenter of the indonesian earthquake that produced the tsunamis , and another 4,500 in the southern indian state of tamil nadu . more than 1,500 people , among them more than 700 foreign tourists , were killed in southern thailand , officials said .
they feared that most of around 1,500 people still missing were foreign tourists . in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- at least 90 people were killed , according to the united nations , while 65 people were dead in malaysia , officials said . at least 55 people including two british holidaymakers were killed in the tourist paradise of the maldives while another 69 were missing , officials said . fatalities also occurred on the east coast of africa where 100 fishermen were declared dead in somalia , 10 in tanzania and one in kenya . new threat from disease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddhist monk looks at bodies of victims of the waves and floods in a temple in southern thailand experts warned that disease could multiply the horror of asia 's tsunami catastrophe , pushing estimates of the final toll to over 100,000 as the world 's biggest ever relief operation stuttered into life against enormous odds wednesday . " there is a chance that we could have at least as many dying from communicable diseases as we had dying from the tsunami , " said david nabarro , the top official at the world health organization dealing with humanitarian crises . the task of preventing this second wave of suffering is unprecedented , with un disaster relief coordinator jan egeland saying relief operations would be the biggest in history . while the aid organizations made their plans and governments around the world pledged cash and dispatched ships and aircraft to help , the millions of bereaved and homeless faced a seemingly hopeless task of rebuilding shattered lives amidst utter chaos . miracles among the horror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors from the swiss humanitarian aid unit take inventory of emergency supplies after arriving at the phuket international airport , wednesday , dec .
29 , 2004 , in phuket thailand there were stories of miraculous escapes , such as that of a 13-year-old girl who survived after spending two days clinging to a wooden door in the indian ocean after being swept off a remote island . but there were far more stories of unspeakable horror , with mass burials underway everywhere accompanied by huge outpourings of grief from people who had lost their entire families , homes and livelihoods . in indonesia 's aceh province , fast emerging as the quake 's ground zero , survivors scrabbled for food among mud and corpses .
great tracts of land remain under surging waters and there has been no word from many isolated communities . the first shipments of international aid arrived in the city of banda aceh , 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,200 miles -rrb- northwest of jakarta on wednesday , but with no trucks or fuel to distribute it , starvation loomed for thousands . throughout the region , hundreds of rescue ships , helicopters and planes were mobilized on relief missions . asian stock markets hitting highs in a sign of the brutal disconnect between investors and the poor who suffered the tragedy , however , indonesian and indian stock markets were hitting record highs on perceived economic good times . for investors , the headline figure since sunday has not been the catastrophic death toll in remote stretches of the indian ocean among people who were hardly movers and shakers in the global economy . instead , the business community has paid more attention to studies that foreign insurance firms were largely unscathed by the killer waves and that major tour operators have been forced to re-route holidaymakers . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder expects hundreds of dead the german foreign office predicts that the number of germans dead or missing following the asian tsunamis will be in the hundreds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 29.12.2004 should turkey join the eu ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will in october conditionally start accession talks with turkey german conservatives have turned to colleagues in france for help in blocking turkey 's bid to join the european union .
dw readers weighed in on whether turkey should indeed become part of the bloc . the following comments reflect a cross-section of the views of our readers .
if you would like to have your say on this or another issue , please click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be automatically published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . turkey has legislated laws in view of full eu membership and these have been acknowledged on numerous occasions in the conclusions of european council summits .
the 1993 copenhagen criteria is being slowly but steadily met .
the question lies on the grounds whether the eu can manage to include turkey .
if we take into consideration the present 2004 , has the eu digested the new member states ?
should it embark on another huge project of enlargement so fast ?
are religion and cyprus insurmountable issues ?
should the eu step back ?
accession of negotiations should initiate with mutual understanding that it is going to take a long time for the eu to be ready to absorb turkey and for turkey to implement the legislation which it changed over the years .
the issue of recognition of cyprus is to be dealt with right before the start of the talks in order to have it out of the way .
on other issues , it should be treated as other candidates have been treated .
religion is not an issue if it is not mixed up with politics .
france -lrb- for instance -rrb- desires a secular europe and on similar ground , therefore , religion should be left to theologists not to politicians . - joe borg camilleri i believe that conservatives ' views are not in the interest of whole eu .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . turkey has legislated laws in view of full eu membership and these have been acknowledged on numerous occasions in the conclusions of european council summits .
the 1993 copenhagen criteria is being slowly but steadily met .
the question lies on the grounds whether the eu can manage to include turkey .
if we take into consideration the present 2004 , has the eu digested the new member states ?
should it embark on another huge project of enlargement so fast ?
are religion and cyprus insurmountable issues ?
should the eu step back ?
accession of negotiations should initiate with mutual understanding that it is going to take a long time for the eu to be ready to absorb turkey and for turkey to implement the legislation which it changed over the years .
the issue of recognition of cyprus is to be dealt with right before the start of the talks in order to have it out of the way .

on jan .
1 , the european union ’ s new clean air laws come into effect .
what promises to give more germans a breath of fresh air has the country of car lovers up in arms . germany is a country of cars .
the automobile industry is famous for its quality products and in particular german men are often accused of loving their cars more than anything else in their lives . a european union directive could put an end to this - or at least hamper this loving relationship . in just a few days , from jan .
1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .
" but all want to ensure as low a threshold of cuts as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new limits stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .
metzger said it was still unclear whether this will lead to a wave of class-action lawsuits . ensuring individual mobility germany ’ s powerful automobile association adac is worried that the new laws could impair mobility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on a highway near munich " all measures against air pollution can only take hold if they also apply to the main sources , " said adac ’ s vice-president for transportation , erhard oehm .
authorities could not put all eggs in one basket . " since cars with gasoline engines hardly and diesel-powered cars only marginally contribute to the emissions , this has to be considered accordingly , " said oehm .
" individual mobility must continue to be ensured by all the measures affecting road traffic . " according to oehm , speed limits were not a viable alternative , as they had in the past hardly led to a decrease in air pollutants .
closing inner cities to traffic should only be considered in extreme situations , he said .
more intelligent traffic control , such as a progressive stoplight system , would be more effective , he said . a viable alternative the background of the eu directive is the simple fact that these particulate materials are harmful to health . " respiratory and cardiovascular diseases can to a high degree be traced back to inhaled fine dust , " trittin said .
" especially in metropolitan areas , hundreds and thousands of people fall ill for this reason every year , and many cases are fatal . " one viable alternative is busses , taxis and cars , which run on natural gas , a possibility also supported by adac .
these vehicles do not pose a problem with respect to particulates or nitrogen oxide .
also , biogenious fuels are exempted from germany ’ s high petroleum tax . according to figures by the federal association of the german gas industry , some 27,000 natural gas vehicles were on german roads in 2004 .
this marked a 40 percent increase to the previous year .
at the same time , the german gas industry opens three new natural gas stations - per week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening traffic in berlin natural gas is one solution to tackle the measures imposed by the eu directive .
the next obstacle approaches , though .
in 2010 , strict emission limits for nitrogen oxides , a pollutant emitted primarily by cars and trucks and a precursor to ozone , come into effect .
then , german drivers will face even more restrictions in their loving relationships to their cars . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de future looks dark for germany 's black forest germany 's best-known tourist attraction , the black forest , may be losing some of its luxuriance as a new environmental report warns of dire damage in the region wrought by pollution .

1 , 2005 , directive 1999/30 / eg takes effect .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities will have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . federal environment minister jürgen trittin urged state and local authorities to increase their efforts to reduce air pollutants . " the government has done its homework , " he said .
" now it 's up to the states and especially the municipalities to fulfill their responsibility toward the health of their citizens . " battling poor air quality in june 2004 , a federal resolution indicated that without drastic measures , some 70 to 120 german municipalities could expect to exceed the eu limits .
these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .

these districts had to present air quality plans of action to the eu by the end of this year . according to jens metzger from the german cities council , those urban areas affected were " confident " that they would comply with the provisions .
he said various possibilities were being considered . " the strategies range from replacing old busses , selective driving bans for diesel-powered trucks to better traffic light systems for less stop-and-go traffic , " metzger said .

this will be a challenge for large cities like berlin , which exceeded these levels by far in previous years . the new directive also gives people living near heavily traveled streets the legal mechanism to sue their municipality if the air they ’ re breathing isn ’ t clean enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.12.2004 schiller 's skulls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller -lrb- 1759-1805 -rrb- : where has his head gone ?
as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .
no one knows for sure which of two skulls belonged to the 18th century poet though dna analysis could resolve it . one skull rests in an ornate oak coffin next to that of schiller 's friend and fellow poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , in the weimar ducal vault .
the other sits in an unmarked , inconspicuous casket .
experts bicker over which skull was schiller 's . although dna analysis would likely clear up the confusion , the weimar classics foundation , which oversees schiller and goethe memorial sites in the eastern german state of thuringia , has shown no interest in resolving the issue . " no investigations are planned , " spokeswoman angela jahn told bild daily .
" that would n't change anything anyway .
we need a comparative value for an analysis , but a hair , for example , could also not be genuine . " actually , any material upon which schiller 's dna traces have been preserved would suffice , whether from his clothing or from a descendent , anthropologist ursula wittwer-backofen told the associated press .
mixed-up exhumation ? schiller 's body was buried in a mass grave in weimar on the night of his death on may 11 , 1805 .
but it had n't found its final resting place .
schiller 's widow intended her husband be buried in an individual grave . still , the plot was n't re-opened until 1826 , by which time the coffins had burst and the bodies had decomposed .
weimar mayor karl leberecht schwabe set up the 23 recovered skulls on a table , pointed to the largest one and declared , " that must be schiller 's skull . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller statue in weimar half a year later , goethe collected the skull , which he kept on blue velvet cushion underneath a bell jar .
since december 1827 the skull and other bones attributed to schiller have rested in the oak coffin in weimar 's ducal vault . hermann welcker was the first to call the skull 's authenticity into question , in 1883 .
although experts agreed with the anatomist , laymen were outraged .
finally , in 1911 , another exhumation of the mass grave brought forth 63 additional skulls , one of which was said to be schiller 's , according to göttingen philologist albrecht schöne , who wrote a book about the mix-up .
the second skull was moved to the weimer ducal vault in 1914 . " it would certainly be embarrassing for the -lrb- weimar classics -rrb- foundation , if both skulls were proven to be false , " schöne said . besides , the foundation is likely more concerned with the restoration of the 16th-18th century books from the anna amalia library - which was badly damaged by fire in september - than with resolving the skull question . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.12.2004 schiller 's skulls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller -lrb- 1759-1805 -rrb- : where has his head gone ?
as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .
no one knows for sure which of two skulls belonged to the 18th century poet though dna analysis could resolve it . one skull rests in an ornate oak coffin next to that of schiller 's friend and fellow poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , in the weimar ducal vault .
the other sits in an unmarked , inconspicuous casket .
experts bicker over which skull was schiller 's . although dna analysis would likely clear up the confusion , the weimar classics foundation , which oversees schiller and goethe memorial sites in the eastern german state of thuringia , has shown no interest in resolving the issue . " no investigations are planned , " spokeswoman angela jahn told bild daily .
" that would n't change anything anyway .
we need a comparative value for an analysis , but a hair , for example , could also not be genuine . " actually , any material upon which schiller 's dna traces have been preserved would suffice , whether from his clothing or from a descendent , anthropologist ursula wittwer-backofen told the associated press .
mixed-up exhumation ? schiller 's body was buried in a mass grave in weimar on the night of his death on may 11 , 1805 .
but it had n't found its final resting place .
schiller 's widow intended her husband be buried in an individual grave . still , the plot was n't re-opened until 1826 , by which time the coffins had burst and the bodies had decomposed .
weimar mayor karl leberecht schwabe set up the 23 recovered skulls on a table , pointed to the largest one and declared , " that must be schiller 's skull . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller statue in weimar half a year later , goethe collected the skull , which he kept on blue velvet cushion underneath a bell jar .
since december 1827 the skull and other bones attributed to schiller have rested in the oak coffin in weimar 's ducal vault . hermann welcker was the first to call the skull 's authenticity into question , in 1883 .
although experts agreed with the anatomist , laymen were outraged .
finally , in 1911 , another exhumation of the mass grave brought forth 63 additional skulls , one of which was said to be schiller 's , according to göttingen philologist albrecht schöne , who wrote a book about the mix-up .
the second skull was moved to the weimer ducal vault in 1914 . " it would certainly be embarrassing for the -lrb- weimar classics -rrb- foundation , if both skulls were proven to be false , " schöne said . besides , the foundation is likely more concerned with the restoration of the 16th-18th century books from the anna amalia library - which was badly damaged by fire in september - than with resolving the skull question . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .
no one knows for sure which of two skulls belonged to the 18th century poet though dna analysis could resolve it . one skull rests in an ornate oak coffin next to that of schiller 's friend and fellow poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , in the weimar ducal vault .
the other sits in an unmarked , inconspicuous casket .
experts bicker over which skull was schiller 's . although dna analysis would likely clear up the confusion , the weimar classics foundation , which oversees schiller and goethe memorial sites in the eastern german state of thuringia , has shown no interest in resolving the issue . " no investigations are planned , " spokeswoman angela jahn told bild daily .
" that would n't change anything anyway .
we need a comparative value for an analysis , but a hair , for example , could also not be genuine . " actually , any material upon which schiller 's dna traces have been preserved would suffice , whether from his clothing or from a descendent , anthropologist ursula wittwer-backofen told the associated press .
mixed-up exhumation ? schiller 's body was buried in a mass grave in weimar on the night of his death on may 11 , 1805 .
but it had n't found its final resting place .
schiller 's widow intended her husband be buried in an individual grave . still , the plot was n't re-opened until 1826 , by which time the coffins had burst and the bodies had decomposed .
weimar mayor karl leberecht schwabe set up the 23 recovered skulls on a table , pointed to the largest one and declared , " that must be schiller 's skull . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller statue in weimar half a year later , goethe collected the skull , which he kept on blue velvet cushion underneath a bell jar .
since december 1827 the skull and other bones attributed to schiller have rested in the oak coffin in weimar 's ducal vault . hermann welcker was the first to call the skull 's authenticity into question , in 1883 .
although experts agreed with the anatomist , laymen were outraged .
finally , in 1911 , another exhumation of the mass grave brought forth 63 additional skulls , one of which was said to be schiller 's , according to göttingen philologist albrecht schöne , who wrote a book about the mix-up .
the second skull was moved to the weimer ducal vault in 1914 . " it would certainly be embarrassing for the -lrb- weimar classics -rrb- foundation , if both skulls were proven to be false , " schöne said . besides , the foundation is likely more concerned with the restoration of the 16th-18th century books from the anna amalia library - which was badly damaged by fire in september - than with resolving the skull question . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's cultural legacy on ice how much damage a fire at weimar 's anna amalia library did to germany 's cultural legacy will only be clear after a team of bookbinders in leipzig get done with their work - and that could take years .

the average cost of a home in the town , located south east of glasgow , rose from £ 60,988 to £ 103,928 in 2004 .
the increase was 30 % above its nearest scottish rival - larbert , near falkirk .

a dozen scottish towns saw their average house price rise by 30 % or more in 2004 .
the 40 % increase in larbert took average prices there to £ 146,093 , while kilmarnock , coatbridge and johnstone all reported rises of 38 % .

the average cost of a home in the town , located south east of glasgow , rose from £ 60,988 to £ 103,928 in 2004 .
the increase was 30 % above its nearest scottish rival - larbert , near falkirk .
edinburgh remains scotland 's costliest place to buy , with an average price of £ 177,028 , with lochgelly in fife the least expensive at £ 60,885 .
however , bank of scotland group economist tim crawford said the former mining town was likely to benefit from the " ripple effect " from the scottish capital .

mr crawford said that the trend which has seen house price growth in scotland outpace the uk average is expected to continue into 2005 .
" despite these large increases scotland remains the most affordable place to buy a house in the uk , " he said .
a dozen scottish towns saw their average house price rise by 30 % or more in 2004 .
the 40 % increase in larbert took average prices there to £ 146,093 , while kilmarnock , coatbridge and johnstone all reported rises of 38 % .
price rise for the last two years the major house price gains have been seen in the west of scotland .
across the uk , the second largest price rise was seen in dukinfield , cheshire , where they increased by 60 % to an average of £ 124,697 .
port talbot in west glamorgan was third with a 50 % increase during 2004 to £ 96,846 .

committee members will set out their official response to the proposals , which have been criticised by some fire-fighters and local mps .
the meeting , on the 4 january , has been called solely to discuss government proposals to merge devon 's control room with six other counties in the region .
last month , the firefighters ' union held a protest opposing the plans .
official response the government wants fire services in dorset , wiltshire , gloucestershire , avon , somerset , devon and cornwall to be run from one control room .
some devon mps have lodged objections with the government .
devon fire and rescue service 's bid to build the new control room was unsuccessful and it is believed that three private companies have been shortlisted for the construction contract .
chief fire officer , paul young , says it is possible devon could still be chosen as the location of the new control room .
he says the fire authority will set out its opinions of the merger scheme and send an official response to ministers .
in october , john prescott announced that none of the bids from the county fire services to run the new centre would be considered .
the fire brigades union -lrb- fbu -rrb- has accused the government of using the south west as a " guinea pig " for plans to scrap local emergency fire control rooms .
the final decision on the site will be announced by the office of the deputy prime minister in the new year .

he explains what it was like stepping into the shoes of a legend , alongside rhys ifans as peter cook .
peter cook and dudley moore were a perfect double-act - the tall , elegant , quick-witted cook contrasting with the short and intensely dark moore .
but the comedy duo , who were credited as the inventors of modern british satire , shared a complex relationship and each had deeply troubled private lives .
not only but always , written by acclaimed playwright terry johnson , explores cook and moore 's creative collaborations and personal resentments , starting with their first meeting as oxbridge graduates in 1959 .
it takes viewers through their beginnings in beyond the fringe , pete and dud , derek and clive , to cook 's founding of private eye magazine and moore 's transformation into a hollywood star .
it ends with cook 's death at the age of 57 in 1995 . "
playing dudley was scary because he was so well loved " aidan mcardle stage and television actor aidan mcardle portrays moore alongside rhys ifans as the irrepressible cook .
mcardle says he enjoyed the challenge of playing moore , who died of a rare brain condition in march 2002 .
" the original casting director had laughed at the thought of me , and irishman , playing dudley moore but when the casting agent changed , they decided to give me a go , " he says .
" i got as many videos and dvds of his stuff as i could and i just sat in front of the television . "
for the audition , mcardle was asked to recreate one of moore 's performances with the writer , terry johnson , as cook .
" it was really difficult and very strange trying to recreate a performance , complete with laughing , " he explains .
" at one point i was not going to go into the audition as i was appalling , but after some practice it just clicked . "
ifans , who has starred in a number of films including notting hill and enduring love , was chased for two years before agreeing to play cook .
he said he was " dying to do it " , but frightened at finding the right dudley to make the film work .
mcardle says it was " great fun " working with ifans , with each taking on their roles away from the camera too .
" we both started taking on our roles : i started playing the slightly overbearing perfectionist and he became a bit of a bully , " says mcardle .
" i think rhys had a secret competition with himself to see if he could make me choke with laughter every day .
" he would wait until i was drinking something and then say something that would make me breathe in , spit out or spray the contents of the liquid in question . "
mcardle describes cook and moore 's co-dependent working relationship as a " marriage " .
hollywood star " their relationship had similar attributes to that of a marriage .
they needed each other , but they also disliked the fact that they needed each other .
" there is a part in the film where peter cook looks at dudley and says ' to the death then ' .
" there is an element that they were thrown together but could not leave each other 's shadow . "
moore went on to pursue a successful career in hollywood in the 1970s starring in a number of hit screen comedies .
he played alongside bo derek in the movie 10 in 1979 and his role as a hard-drinking millionaire in the 1981 film arthur then won him an oscar nomination .
mcardle admits that portraying a legend was a daunting experience .
" playing dudley was scary because he was so well loved , " he says .
" if you get it wrong it is glaringly obvious .
everyone who has seen even just one film with dudley in it will know .
" it was a great responsibility to do it properly and to do it with sensitivity . "

he explains what it was like stepping into the shoes of a legend , alongside rhys ifans as peter cook .
peter cook and dudley moore were a perfect double-act - the tall , elegant , quick-witted cook contrasting with the short and intensely dark moore .
but the comedy duo , who were credited as the inventors of modern british satire , shared a complex relationship and each had deeply troubled private lives .
not only but always , written by acclaimed playwright terry johnson , explores cook and moore 's creative collaborations and personal resentments , starting with their first meeting as oxbridge graduates in 1959 .
it takes viewers through their beginnings in beyond the fringe , pete and dud , derek and clive , to cook 's founding of private eye magazine and moore 's transformation into a hollywood star .
it ends with cook 's death at the age of 57 in 1995 .
playing dudley was scary because he was so well loved aidan mcardle stage and television actor aidan mcardle portrays moore alongside rhys ifans as the irrepressible cook .
mcardle says he enjoyed the challenge of playing moore , who died of a rare brain condition in march 2002 .
" the original casting director had laughed at the thought of me , and irishman , playing dudley moore but when the casting agent changed , they decided to give me a go , " he says .
" i got as many videos and dvds of his stuff as i could and i just sat in front of the television . "
for the audition , mcardle was asked to recreate one of moore 's performances with the writer , terry johnson , as cook .
" it was really difficult and very strange trying to recreate a performance , complete with laughing , " he explains .
cook and moore 's series not only ...
but also was a huge hit " at one point i was not going to go into the audition as i was appalling , but after some practice it just clicked . "
ifans , who has starred in a number of films including notting hill and enduring love , was chased for two years before agreeing to play cook .
he said he was " dying to do it " , but frightened at finding the right dudley to make the film work .
mcardle says it was " great fun " working with ifans , with each taking on their roles away from the camera too .
" we both started taking on our roles : i started playing the slightly overbearing perfectionist and he became a bit of a bully , " says mcardle .
" i think rhys had a secret competition with himself to see if he could make me choke with laughter every day .
" he would wait until i was drinking something and then say something that would make me breathe in , spit out or spray the contents of the liquid in question . "
mcardle describes cook and moore 's co-dependent working relationship as a " marriage " .
hollywood star " their relationship had similar attributes to that of a marriage .
they needed each other , but they also disliked the fact that they needed each other .
" there is a part in the film where peter cook looks at dudley and says ' to the death then ' .
" there is an element that they were thrown together but could not leave each other 's shadow . "
moore went on to pursue a successful career in hollywood in the 1970s starring in a number of hit screen comedies .
he played alongside bo derek in the movie 10 in 1979 and his role as a hard-drinking millionaire in the 1981 film arthur then won him an oscar nomination .
mcardle admits that portraying a legend was a daunting experience .
" playing dudley was scary because he was so well loved , " he says .

not that new maps will have to be drawn up for geography lessons , or reinforcements used to make the severn bridge longer .
but in terms of how children are taught here , there is a changing landscape .
the most obvious difference is in exams .
in july , the scrapping in wales of sat exams for 11-year-olds , and their phasing out for 14-year-olds was broadly welcomed by teachers and parents .
the sats were criticised for heaping too much pressure on young children , and too much preparation work on school staff .
whether the new ' skills tests ' for 11-year-olds prove to be any more popular will only become clear when pilot schemes start in 2005 .
the first round of results for the new welsh baccalaureate in the summer was also a bit of a landmark , although it is too early to judge how well the new ' bac ' works alongside conventional gcse , a-level and vocational qualifications .
add to these the arrival of free breakfasts in primary schools and a new play-based curriculum for three-to-seven-year-olds called the ' foundation phase ' , and you can see education in wales is genuinely different .
however different does not always mean better - at least according to the secondary heads association -lrb- sha -rrb- .
at their december conference , they argued that schools in wales were receiving £ 200 per pupil less than those across the border in england .
their research was based on a very small sample , and was hotly contested by the welsh assembly government , who claimed overall welsh schools receive the better deal .
the sha is now calling for an independent review of school funding to take place , to sort out who is right .
in any year , there are also personal stories that leave an impression on pupils , teachers and parents everywhere .
in january , the inquest into the death of schoolboy stuart cunningham-jones put the issue of school bus safety back into the headlines .
stuart was killed on the way home from cowbridge comprehensive , after the school bus he was on crashed two years ago .
in october , south wales police announced they were going to re-investigate the circumstances of his death , after a long-running campaign by his parents .
another tragic story , the death of schoolgirl laura rhodes from neath , brought the issue of bullying to the fore .
laura 's parents believe one of the reasons she took her own life in september was that she was repeatedly bullied , a claim denied by staff at her former school .
there have since been several calls for schools to become more transparent in dealing with bullies , and for a law to be introduced to record all allegations .
top-up answers finally , a look ahead to 2005 .
while students and tutors at welsh universities spent much of the last year worrying about funding , the new year will finally bring some sort of an answer on the future of higher education .
the rees commission , set up to consider the possible introduction of variable or ' top-up ' fees in wales will produce its first , interim report in february .
the basic choice for professor theresa rees and her team is to follow england and allow universities to charge up to £ 3,000 pounds a year for their courses , or recommend a different , ' made in wales ' option .
the decision could be another landmark in devolution , and move wales that little bit further away from england .
