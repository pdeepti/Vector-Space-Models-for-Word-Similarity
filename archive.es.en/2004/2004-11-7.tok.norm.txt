" we reached a preliminary agreement at the experts level , which means a framework that contains the main viewpoints of both sides , " a top iranian negotiator , hossein moussavian , told state television by telephone from paris . " this agreement is to be taken to the capitals of the four countries , and in the next days , if the capitals approve it , it will be announced officially , " he added , asserting that he was " not pessimistic " . " crucial transformation " " should the four countries be able to agree on a package in a not so distant future , there would be a crucial transformation in relations between iran and the eu and the whole international community . " his announcement followed two days of talks between iran and britain , france and germany on getting tehran to suspend uranium enrichment in order to avoid being hauled before the united nations security council for possible sanctions . the united states accuses iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of its civilian atomic energy program and wants the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , to refer tehran to the security council when the agency meets in vienna on november 25 . moussavian said the preliminary agreement included " a collection of political , economic , security , technological and trust-building cooperation regarding the future of iran 's peaceful nuclear activities " . but he refused to give any specific details pending its approval by " the most senior officials " in the islamic republic as well as in the capitals of the eu 's so-called " big three .

" after the four capitals have agreed , we will begin discussions on implementing this agreement .
the next round of discussions will not be so challenging , because the principles will have been set , " moussavian said , adding that he hoped the deal could get the green light as early as " next week . " " i must emphasise that all this is pending the agreement of the four capitals .

tehran has until now resisted europe 's demand for an indefinite suspension , arguing that it would infringe its right to maintain a civilian nuclear power program . enrichment is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the treaty overseen by the iaea and to which iran is a signatory - if for peaceful purposes . however iranian officials have said they were open to maintaining a " voluntary " suspension - but not a total halt - of enrichment . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran , eu nuke talks still without agreement negotiations between eu and iranian diplomats on the issue of iran 's nuclear program appeared to have reached a stalemate on saturday .

" we reached a preliminary agreement at the experts level , which means a framework that contains the main viewpoints of both sides , " a top iranian negotiator , hossein moussavian , told state television by telephone from paris . " this agreement is to be taken to the capitals of the four countries , and in the next days , if the capitals approve it , it will be announced officially , " he added , asserting that he was " not pessimistic " . " crucial transformation " " should the four countries be able to agree on a package in a not so distant future , there would be a crucial transformation in relations between iran and the eu and the whole international community . " his announcement followed two days of talks between iran and britain , france and germany on getting tehran to suspend uranium enrichment in order to avoid being hauled before the united nations security council for possible sanctions . the united states accuses iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of its civilian atomic energy program and wants the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , to refer tehran to the security council when the agency meets in vienna on november 25 . moussavian said the preliminary agreement included " a collection of political , economic , security , technological and trust-building cooperation regarding the future of iran 's peaceful nuclear activities " . but he refused to give any specific details pending its approval by " the most senior officials " in the islamic republic as well as in the capitals of the eu 's so-called " big three .

" after the four capitals have agreed , we will begin discussions on implementing this agreement .
the next round of discussions will not be so challenging , because the principles will have been set , " moussavian said , adding that he hoped the deal could get the green light as early as " next week . " " i must emphasise that all this is pending the agreement of the four capitals .
if it is not approved , we will have to say these discussions failed .

tehran has until now resisted europe 's demand for an indefinite suspension , arguing that it would infringe its right to maintain a civilian nuclear power program . enrichment is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the treaty overseen by the iaea and to which iran is a signatory - if for peaceful purposes . however iranian officials have said they were open to maintaining a " voluntary " suspension - but not a total halt - of enrichment . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran , eu nuke talks still without agreement negotiations between eu and iranian diplomats on the issue of iran 's nuclear program appeared to have reached a stalemate on saturday .

the future of the draft is a divisive issue for the spd and its coalition partner , the greens . german defence minister peter struck is to open talks on military service among the spd leadership next weekend , with a view to reaching a final decision on whether to abolish the draft by fall 2005 , the newspaper welt am sonntag reported .
struck and other spd leaders , including chancellor gerhard schröder , have said they opposed abolishing compulsory military service for young men . " i believe in military service , and i 'm sure that the majority in the spd does as well , " struck told the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens leader claudia roth is pushing for abolition of compulsory military service but the spd 's coalition partner , the green party , has long been campaigning to get rid of compulsory military service .
greens leader claudia roth -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper that germany no longer needs a mass army to defend itself . in the current coalition agreement , the government has committed to reviewing the issue within this legislative period . base closures struck says that abolishing military service in favor of a professional army will have far-reaching consequences .
he recently announced plans to close 105 military bases as part of the bundeswehr 's reform plans , and said that without the regular influx of young conscripts who number around 415,000 per year , a further 60 bases could face closure . social democrat reinhold robbe , head of the parliamentary committee on defence , said scrapping military service would also lead to increased costs of between € 3.5 and 7 billion -lrb- $ 4.5 and 9 billion -rrb- . younger spd members , though , are increasingly against military service , and have published a petition on the internet calling for its abolition .
analysts predict that should the spd oversee the end of conscription , it could be an important vote winner for the party in the 2006 general election . court decision possible the spd 's expert on foreign policy , gernot erler , predicted that the issue is likely to be decided by germany 's constitutional court .
but spd paliamentartian andreas weigel said that would be a mistake . " we should not wait until a court verdict forces us to change .
instead , we should begin the discussion process now , " weigel said .

" we reached a preliminary agreement at the experts level , which means a framework that contains the main viewpoints of both sides , " a top iranian negotiator , hossein moussavian , told state television by telephone from paris . " this agreement is to be taken to the capitals of the four countries , and in the next days , if the capitals approve it , it will be announced officially , " he added , asserting that he was " not pessimistic " . " crucial transformation " " should the four countries be able to agree on a package in a not so distant future , there would be a crucial transformation in relations between iran and the eu and the whole international community . " his announcement followed two days of talks between iran and britain , france and germany on getting tehran to suspend uranium enrichment in order to avoid being hauled before the united nations security council for possible sanctions . the united states accuses iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons under cover of its civilian atomic energy program and wants the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , to refer tehran to the security council when the agency meets in vienna on november 25 . moussavian said the preliminary agreement included " a collection of political , economic , security , technological and trust-building cooperation regarding the future of iran 's peaceful nuclear activities " . but he refused to give any specific details pending its approval by " the most senior officials " in the islamic republic as well as in the capitals of the eu 's so-called " big three . " he also made no mention of whether iran had agreed to meet eu demands that it halt its controversial work on the sensitive nuclear fuel cycle , activities that officials in tehran insist are only aimed at producing fuel for civilian reactors . final agreement pending the europeans fear the process surrounding the enrichment of uranium could be eventually used by iran to build a nuclear bomb . " after the four capitals have agreed , we will begin discussions on implementing this agreement .
the next round of discussions will not be so challenging , because the principles will have been set , " moussavian said , adding that he hoped the deal could get the green light as early as " next week . " " i must emphasise that all this is pending the agreement of the four capitals .
if it is not approved , we will have to say these discussions failed .
but i am not pessimistic , " he told state television . according to diplomatic sources , europe 's three powers are believed to have offered iran nuclear technology , including access to nuclear fuel , increased trade and help with tehran 's regional security concerns in exchange for a halt to enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female iranian students form a human chain around the iranian atomic energy organization 's headquarters in tehran in defense of the right of iran to possess nuclear technology .
tehran has until now resisted europe 's demand for an indefinite suspension , arguing that it would infringe its right to maintain a civilian nuclear power program . enrichment is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the treaty overseen by the iaea and to which iran is a signatory - if for peaceful purposes . however iranian officials have said they were open to maintaining a " voluntary " suspension - but not a total halt - of enrichment . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran , eu nuke talks still without agreement negotiations between eu and iranian diplomats on the issue of iran 's nuclear program appeared to have reached a stalemate on saturday .

" we reached a preliminary agreement at the experts level , which means a framework that contains the main viewpoints of both sides , " a top iranian negotiator , hossein moussavian , told state television by telephone from paris . " this agreement is to be taken to the capitals of the four countries , and in the next days , if the capitals approve it , it will be announced officially , " he added , asserting that he was " not pessimistic " .

" after the four capitals have agreed , we will begin discussions on implementing this agreement .
the next round of discussions will not be so challenging , because the principles will have been set , " moussavian said , adding that he hoped the deal could get the green light as early as " next week . " " i must emphasise that all this is pending the agreement of the four capitals .

the future of the draft is a divisive issue for the spd and its coalition partner , the greens . german defence minister peter struck is to open talks on military service among the spd leadership next weekend , with a view to reaching a final decision on whether to abolish the draft by fall 2005 , the newspaper welt am sonntag reported .

the future of the draft is a divisive issue for the spd and its coalition partner , the greens . german defence minister peter struck is to open talks on military service among the spd leadership next weekend , with a view to reaching a final decision on whether to abolish the draft by fall 2005 , the newspaper welt am sonntag reported .

the future of the draft is a divisive issue for the spd and its coalition partner , the greens . german defence minister peter struck is to open talks on military service among the spd leadership next weekend , with a view to reaching a final decision on whether to abolish the draft by fall 2005 , the newspaper welt am sonntag reported .

he recently announced plans to close 105 military bases as part of the bundeswehr 's reform plans , and said that without the regular influx of young conscripts who number around 415,000 per year , a further 60 bases could face closure . social democrat reinhold robbe , head of the parliamentary committee on defence , said scrapping military service would also lead to increased costs of between € 3.5 and 7 billion -lrb- $ 4.5 and 9 billion -rrb- . younger spd members , though , are increasingly against military service , and have published a petition on the internet calling for its abolition .

the future of the draft is a divisive issue for the spd and its coalition partner , the greens . german defence minister peter struck is to open talks on military service among the spd leadership next weekend , with a view to reaching a final decision on whether to abolish the draft by fall 2005 , the newspaper welt am sonntag reported .

the future of the draft is a divisive issue for the spd and its coalition partner , the greens . german defence minister peter struck is to open talks on military service among the spd leadership next weekend , with a view to reaching a final decision on whether to abolish the draft by fall 2005 , the newspaper welt am sonntag reported .

the 17-hour challenge involves swimming two miles , completing a 112-mile bike ride and running a full marathon .
the 40-year-old mother-of-three , from rothwell , leeds , took on the challenge despite a stay in hospital last week .
mrs tomlinson completed the event , which started at 7am and ended at 11pm florida time , in 15 hours 47 minutes .
sick with nerves as she left for the first part of the event , mrs tomlinson said she felt sick with nerves .
but she now has the satisfaction of going down in the history books as the first terminally-ill person to complete - or even attempt - such a challenge .
to win the event she swam 2.4 miles -lrb- 3.8km -rrb- in the choppy waters of the gulf of mexico before mounting her bike for a 112-mile -lrb- 180km -rrb- ride in the blazing midday sun .
she then ran a full 26-mile -lrb- 40km -rrb- night-time marathon .
mrs tomlinson has already cycled from rome to leeds , completed three london marathons , three london triathlons and two half-ironman triathlons to raise money for her cancer charities .
she says this will be her last challenge .
' awfully painful death ' last week she was admitted to hospital because pain left her unable to walk .
david hancock , a physiotherapist for leeds united , helped her to overcome the pain so she could take part in the event .
her husband mike , 43 , said people should not assume jane found the events easy .
" jane 's dying an awfully painful death , " he said .
" do n't be misled by thinking that because she does endurance events , she does n't suffer .
" the training and races put a huge strain on her body constantly , leaving her in agony .
yet she still has to get to work daily and take annual leave to do the events . "
