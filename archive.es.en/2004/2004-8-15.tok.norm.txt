" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .
" we are pleased that the president is determined to see u.s. negotiators create a more appropriate framework with their eu counterparts .
the current framework can not be justified and needs to be changed immediately , " said boeing president and chief executive officer harry stonecipher . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .
" we are pleased that the president is determined to see u.s. negotiators create a more appropriate framework with their eu counterparts .
the current framework can not be justified and needs to be changed immediately , " said boeing president and chief executive officer harry stonecipher . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .
" we are pleased that the president is determined to see u.s. negotiators create a more appropriate framework with their eu counterparts .
the current framework can not be justified and needs to be changed immediately , " said boeing president and chief executive officer harry stonecipher . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .

but its long upward arc is changing direction . germany 's social welfare system , much loved by those on the left , was in fact put into place by a 19th century conservative prussian with strong authoritarian tendencies , chancellor otto von bismarck .
in the 1880s , he established obligatory health , accident and old-age and disability insurance programs , whose principles have guided the development of social policy development to this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck but bismarck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- motives were not altruistic , and this landed gentleman felt no particular affinity to the working classes .
in fact , he set in motion germany 's welfare state as a way to keep the poor who manned the factories in the rapidly industrializing country from defecting to the hated opposition , the social democrats . while he did not manage to fatally wound his political enemies with the strategy , he did succeed in laying the base for a social welfare system that grew and expanded until , with some exceptions , provided citizens with cradle-to-grave security . expansion course after its inception and until world war i , the social insurance was limited to workers and did n't cover white-collar employees .
that changed during the 1920s and the weimar republic , when german social policy embarked on an expansion course .
important benefits were added during this time , such as unemployment insurance in 1927 . that growth continued during the nazi era , as health care and old age provisions were improved upon . " when a government is preparing its citizens for a war , it 's important to give them something , " karl hinrichs , professor at the university of bremen 's center for social policy , told dw-world .
" this was the carrot part of the carrot and stick approach . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer after the war , the next big change came in 1957 , when then-chancellor konrad adenauer -lrb- photo -rrb- , another conservative , put through his pension reform law , that was designed with the ambitious goal of sharing the wealth of germany 's " economic miracle " with the retirees who had contributed to it during their working lives . the new system abandoned the earlier bismarck system of residual benefits designed only to keep the elderly out of severe poverty .
it replaced them with pensions linked to past wages and increases in payout amounts coupled with rising wage levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german retirees the scheme was financed through shared employer and employee contributions calculated as a percentage of gross wages , the " pay-as-you-go " model .
it paid for current pension benefits , which averaged about 70 percent of previous wages , out of what current workers paid in , a plan which worked very well during the boom years of the 1950s and 1960s . " the reform put an end to the old maxim , being old is being poor , " said hinrichs . the system remained in good health until the early 1970s , even after almost twenty years of rising benefits .
this was reflected in the fact that in 1970 , total social contributions , were around 26 percent of gross wages .
twenty years later , they were approaching 40 percent . turning point the good economic times were not to last .
the oil crisis of the early seventies effectively ended germany 's " miracle " and the first signs appeared hinting that the social welfare system might run into future problems .
demographers began looking at future population structures in the country and coming to the conclusion that the population was beginning age significantly .
the graying of the society then looked poised to accelerate rapidly in the 21st century . the 1980s brought further bad news , as rising unemployment , slowing growth and rising contribution rates began to put more pressure on the system . in 1990 , when the two german states were reunited , east germans began to participate fully in the west german system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed waiting at a job center in the western city of gelsenkirchen .
expenditures shot up , and the massive loss of jobs in the east meant workers were paying less into the system , but demanding more of it .
the system 's financing model increasingly looked unsustainable . " but the government had been able to make it all work until then , and kind of fallen asleep at the wheel , " said hinrichs .
" other countries with similar systems started tackling these kinds of problems earlier than germany did . " slowly , many analysts say much too slowly , officials began to realized the system created in the 19th century was no longer functioning in the 21st .
advances in health care mean that today people are drawing of pensions for twenty years or more .
a century ago , drawing a pension for five years was considered a long time .
payroll taxes have had to steadily increase to finance the system , making german labor more expensive .
that , in turn , causes firms to leave germany for cheaper shores and drives up unemployment , which , in a vicious circle , drains the system further . reforms ?
no thanks but attempts by chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government to reform the system to ensure its long-term survival and boost economic growth have met with widespread anger from the populace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in leipzig against welfare and labor market reforms .
recent rallies in eastern germany protesting the so-called hartz iv law which would trim benefits for many , particularly the long-term unemployed , have brought thousands of people to the streets .
several members of schröder 's own social democrats have threatened to split from the party on the issue .
apparently taken aback by the intensity of the protests , schröder has been forced to soften some of the reforms ' rougher edges . still , the chancellor insists that wide-ranging and sometimes painful reforms are the only way that the country 's welfare state will survive in any form in today 's globalized world .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .
" we are pleased that the president is determined to see u.s. negotiators create a more appropriate framework with their eu counterparts .

now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "

she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .

she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's year in review cannibal convicted of manslaughter europe 's integration challenge when bullies enter the military german carmakers face a bumpy ride current affairs -pipe- 15.08.2004 german welfare state at a turning point großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like their welfare state and are in no mood to give it up germany 's social insurance system is one of the most generous in the world and boasts both a long history and extended expansion course .
but its long upward arc is changing direction . germany 's social welfare system , much loved by those on the left , was in fact put into place by a 19th century conservative prussian with strong authoritarian tendencies , chancellor otto von bismarck .
in the 1880s , he established obligatory health , accident and old-age and disability insurance programs , whose principles have guided the development of social policy development to this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck but bismarck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- motives were not altruistic , and this landed gentleman felt no particular affinity to the working classes .
in fact , he set in motion germany 's welfare state as a way to keep the poor who manned the factories in the rapidly industrializing country from defecting to the hated opposition , the social democrats . while he did not manage to fatally wound his political enemies with the strategy , he did succeed in laying the base for a social welfare system that grew and expanded until , with some exceptions , provided citizens with cradle-to-grave security . expansion course after its inception and until world war i , the social insurance was limited to workers and did n't cover white-collar employees .
that changed during the 1920s and the weimar republic , when german social policy embarked on an expansion course .
important benefits were added during this time , such as unemployment insurance in 1927 . that growth continued during the nazi era , as health care and old age provisions were improved upon . " when a government is preparing its citizens for a war , it 's important to give them something , " karl hinrichs , professor at the university of bremen 's center for social policy , told dw-world .
" this was the carrot part of the carrot and stick approach . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer after the war , the next big change came in 1957 , when then-chancellor konrad adenauer -lrb- photo -rrb- , another conservative , put through his pension reform law , that was designed with the ambitious goal of sharing the wealth of germany 's " economic miracle " with the retirees who had contributed to it during their working lives . the new system abandoned the earlier bismarck system of residual benefits designed only to keep the elderly out of severe poverty .
it replaced them with pensions linked to past wages and increases in payout amounts coupled with rising wage levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german retirees the scheme was financed through shared employer and employee contributions calculated as a percentage of gross wages , the " pay-as-you-go " model .
it paid for current pension benefits , which averaged about 70 percent of previous wages , out of what current workers paid in , a plan which worked very well during the boom years of the 1950s and 1960s . " the reform put an end to the old maxim , being old is being poor , " said hinrichs . the system remained in good health until the early 1970s , even after almost twenty years of rising benefits .
this was reflected in the fact that in 1970 , total social contributions , were around 26 percent of gross wages .
twenty years later , they were approaching 40 percent . turning point the good economic times were not to last .
the oil crisis of the early seventies effectively ended germany 's " miracle " and the first signs appeared hinting that the social welfare system might run into future problems .
demographers began looking at future population structures in the country and coming to the conclusion that the population was beginning age significantly .
the graying of the society then looked poised to accelerate rapidly in the 21st century . the 1980s brought further bad news , as rising unemployment , slowing growth and rising contribution rates began to put more pressure on the system . in 1990 , when the two german states were reunited , east germans began to participate fully in the west german system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed waiting at a job center in the western city of gelsenkirchen .
expenditures shot up , and the massive loss of jobs in the east meant workers were paying less into the system , but demanding more of it .
the system 's financing model increasingly looked unsustainable . " but the government had been able to make it all work until then , and kind of fallen asleep at the wheel , " said hinrichs .
" other countries with similar systems started tackling these kinds of problems earlier than germany did . " slowly , many analysts say much too slowly , officials began to realized the system created in the 19th century was no longer functioning in the 21st .
advances in health care mean that today people are drawing of pensions for twenty years or more .
a century ago , drawing a pension for five years was considered a long time .
payroll taxes have had to steadily increase to finance the system , making german labor more expensive .
that , in turn , causes firms to leave germany for cheaper shores and drives up unemployment , which , in a vicious circle , drains the system further . reforms ?
no thanks but attempts by chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government to reform the system to ensure its long-term survival and boost economic growth have met with widespread anger from the populace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in leipzig against welfare and labor market reforms .
recent rallies in eastern germany protesting the so-called hartz iv law which would trim benefits for many , particularly the long-term unemployed , have brought thousands of people to the streets .
several members of schröder 's own social democrats have threatened to split from the party on the issue .
apparently taken aback by the intensity of the protests , schröder has been forced to soften some of the reforms ' rougher edges . still , the chancellor insists that wide-ranging and sometimes painful reforms are the only way that the country 's welfare state will survive in any form in today 's globalized world .
most analysts agree . " it 's difficult to put these reforms through in germany , although they have to go further , " said hinrichs .
" people are accustomed to their benefits and they 're not ready yet to give them up .

however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .
" we are pleased that the president is determined to see u.s. negotiators create a more appropriate framework with their eu counterparts .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .
" we are pleased that the president is determined to see u.s. negotiators create a more appropriate framework with their eu counterparts .

but its long upward arc is changing direction . germany 's social welfare system , much loved by those on the left , was in fact put into place by a 19th century conservative prussian with strong authoritarian tendencies , chancellor otto von bismarck .
in the 1880s , he established obligatory health , accident and old-age and disability insurance programs , whose principles have guided the development of social policy development to this day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck but bismarck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- motives were not altruistic , and this landed gentleman felt no particular affinity to the working classes .
in fact , he set in motion germany 's welfare state as a way to keep the poor who manned the factories in the rapidly industrializing country from defecting to the hated opposition , the social democrats . while he did not manage to fatally wound his political enemies with the strategy , he did succeed in laying the base for a social welfare system that grew and expanded until , with some exceptions , provided citizens with cradle-to-grave security . expansion course after its inception and until world war i , the social insurance was limited to workers and did n't cover white-collar employees .
that changed during the 1920s and the weimar republic , when german social policy embarked on an expansion course .
important benefits were added during this time , such as unemployment insurance in 1927 . that growth continued during the nazi era , as health care and old age provisions were improved upon . " when a government is preparing its citizens for a war , it 's important to give them something , " karl hinrichs , professor at the university of bremen 's center for social policy , told dw-world .
" this was the carrot part of the carrot and stick approach . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer after the war , the next big change came in 1957 , when then-chancellor konrad adenauer -lrb- photo -rrb- , another conservative , put through his pension reform law , that was designed with the ambitious goal of sharing the wealth of germany 's " economic miracle " with the retirees who had contributed to it during their working lives . the new system abandoned the earlier bismarck system of residual benefits designed only to keep the elderly out of severe poverty .
it replaced them with pensions linked to past wages and increases in payout amounts coupled with rising wage levels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german retirees the scheme was financed through shared employer and employee contributions calculated as a percentage of gross wages , the " pay-as-you-go " model .
it paid for current pension benefits , which averaged about 70 percent of previous wages , out of what current workers paid in , a plan which worked very well during the boom years of the 1950s and 1960s . " the reform put an end to the old maxim , being old is being poor , " said hinrichs . the system remained in good health until the early 1970s , even after almost twenty years of rising benefits .
this was reflected in the fact that in 1970 , total social contributions , were around 26 percent of gross wages .
twenty years later , they were approaching 40 percent . turning point the good economic times were not to last .
the oil crisis of the early seventies effectively ended germany 's " miracle " and the first signs appeared hinting that the social welfare system might run into future problems .
demographers began looking at future population structures in the country and coming to the conclusion that the population was beginning age significantly .
the graying of the society then looked poised to accelerate rapidly in the 21st century . the 1980s brought further bad news , as rising unemployment , slowing growth and rising contribution rates began to put more pressure on the system . in 1990 , when the two german states were reunited , east germans began to participate fully in the west german system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployed waiting at a job center in the western city of gelsenkirchen .
expenditures shot up , and the massive loss of jobs in the east meant workers were paying less into the system , but demanding more of it .
the system 's financing model increasingly looked unsustainable . " but the government had been able to make it all work until then , and kind of fallen asleep at the wheel , " said hinrichs .
" other countries with similar systems started tackling these kinds of problems earlier than germany did . " slowly , many analysts say much too slowly , officials began to realized the system created in the 19th century was no longer functioning in the 21st .
advances in health care mean that today people are drawing of pensions for twenty years or more .
a century ago , drawing a pension for five years was considered a long time .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .
" we are pleased that the president is determined to see u.s. negotiators create a more appropriate framework with their eu counterparts .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .
" we are pleased that the president is determined to see u.s. negotiators create a more appropriate framework with their eu counterparts .
the current framework can not be justified and needs to be changed immediately , " said boeing president and chief executive officer harry stonecipher . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .
" we are pleased that the president is determined to see u.s. negotiators create a more appropriate framework with their eu counterparts .
the current framework can not be justified and needs to be changed immediately , " said boeing president and chief executive officer harry stonecipher . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .
" we are pleased that the president is determined to see u.s. negotiators create a more appropriate framework with their eu counterparts .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .
eu rejects criticism on saturday , the european commission in brussels struck back at bush .
" the eu would like to point out that there are specific and clear rules on government support to both -lrb- us aircraft manufacturer -rrb- boeing and airbus laid down in the eu-us 1992 aircraft agreement , " commission spokeswoman ewa hedlund told the french news agency afp .
" the agreement contains a revision clause and the european commission made suggestions to improve the agreement as early as 1997 , which were at the time rejected by the us .
if the us now feels a need to review the functioning of the agreement , the european commission is open to discussions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government incentives are also a major part of the plan for constructing boeing 's new 7e7 dreamliner in washington state .
" of course , any discussion needs to address both direct support , as granted by european governments to airbus in the form of loans , and indirect support , as provided by the us government to boeing , " hedlund said .
she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .
boeing cheers bush boeing greeted bush 's statement as well as his demand that the issue be brought to the table at the next us-europe summit , which is scheduled to take place in september .
the 1992 accord will be a central focus at the meeting .
" we are pleased that the president is determined to see u.s. negotiators create a more appropriate framework with their eu counterparts .
the current framework can not be justified and needs to be changed immediately , " said boeing president and chief executive officer harry stonecipher . dw staff -lrb- dsl / afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .

" i 've instructed the u.s. trade representative , bob zoellick , to inform european officials in his september meeting that we think these subsidies are unfair and he should pursue all options to end these subsidies , including bringing a wto case if need be , " bush said on friday .
the president was in seattle , washington , on a campaign stop and met with a group of managers at airbus competitor boeing .
" we believe in free trade , but we want that free trade to be fair as well and getting rid of the subsidies of airbus will make the trade fair , will make the playing field level , " bush told the group .
last year , airbus overtook boeing as the world 's market leader for civilian aircraft .
now boeing is accusing airbus of receiving unfair subsidies from european governments .
however , airbus executives have noted that what the company receives from european governments are legal loans that the airplane manufacturer is required to repay .
the loans are legal and legitimate under the terms of a 1992 us-european accord that calls for an gradual reduction of state aid for companies .
the accord also permits airbus to obtain loans from governments under favorable terms .

she stressed the eu had " as strong an interest in disciplining government support to boeing as the us administration has in disciplining support to airbus " and pointed out that talks on that subject were in preparation .
recently , airbus has raised questions about the $ 3.2 billion in incentives the state of washington has offered boeing to secure the assembly plant for its new 7e7 dreamliner plane .
the company said it is also gathering information about government loans and subsidies promised to japanese manufacturers who will do about one-third of the work on the aircraft .

the police superintendents association believes the existing 43 police forces of england and wales are based on outdated boundaries and structures .
the association makes the call in their official response to government plans for reform of the police service .
but the association of chief police officers does not favour such a move .
psa president rick naylor said : " the existing structure of 43 autonomous entities aligned to boundaries which no longer reflect government structures in the regions , or the very local identities felt by individual communities has , we believe , outlived its usefulness . "
a logical solution would be a national police force deployed through a regional structure rick naylor " we have now reached the point where further significant improvement can not be achieved without stepping outside the current structural arrangements .
" a logical solution would be a national police force deployed through a regional structure . "
the association is the first of the three main police unions to back the controversial proposal .
" we recognise that the proposal to create a national police force does not appear to sit comfortably with the received wisdom that british policing is best provided by local units allied to traditional boundaries .
" it is , however , our firm view that our proposal would provide precisely such a structure at the most local level and would simultaneously provide the consistency of approach which is so glaringly absent at the present time . "
cross-border crime he said there was a " clear gap " in the police 's current ability to tackle crimes that spanned county borders .
last november , home secretary david blunkett hinted a possible restructure of policing in england and wales could see smaller forces give way larger " strategic " forces .
but the home office 's consultation paper , to which mr naylor was responding , stopped short of suggestion a national police force .
acpo president chris fox said : " we see no benefit in a national police service .

the police superintendents association believes the existing 43 police forces of england and wales are based on outdated boundaries and structures .
the association makes the call in their official response to government plans for reform of the police service .
but the association of chief police officers does not favour such a move .
psa president rick naylor said : " the existing structure of 43 autonomous entities aligned to boundaries which no longer reflect government structures in the regions , or the very local identities felt by individual communities has , we believe , outlived its usefulness . "
a logical solution would be a national police force deployed through a regional structure rick naylor " we have now reached the point where further significant improvement can not be achieved without stepping outside the current structural arrangements .
" a logical solution would be a national police force deployed through a regional structure . "
the association is the first of the three main police unions to back the controversial proposal .
" we recognise that the proposal to create a national police force does not appear to sit comfortably with the received wisdom that british policing is best provided by local units allied to traditional boundaries .
" it is , however , our firm view that our proposal would provide precisely such a structure at the most local level and would simultaneously provide the consistency of approach which is so glaringly absent at the present time . "
cross-border crime he said there was a " clear gap " in the police 's current ability to tackle crimes that spanned county borders .
last november , home secretary david blunkett hinted a possible restructure of policing in england and wales could see smaller forces give way larger " strategic " forces .
but the home office 's consultation paper , to which mr naylor was responding , stopped short of suggestion a national police force .
acpo president chris fox said : " we see no benefit in a national police service .

competing technology groups are proposing different ways to speed up the data rates of wi-fi which could reach 540 megabits per second .
the battling technologies , called wwise and tgn sync , are being assessed by the us organisation that rubber stamps improvements to wireless technology .
wireless nets have proved a popular because they let people get fast access to the net and are easy to set up .
faster data both proposals to speed up wi-fi exist largely on paper and could take years to find their way into hardware .
the us institute of electrical and electronics engineers -lrb- ieee -rrb- oversees developments to wi-fi technology , the most well known of which goes by the family name of 802.11 .
there are already several different 802.11 technologies , a , b and g , that work at different speeds .
the fastest works at speeds of 54mbps .
the ieee 's 802.11n working group has been looking at ways to improve the data throughput of the wi-fi standard .
it aims to get data travelling at rates of 100mbps and more via the airwaves .
although current wi-fi systems can already work at speeds up to 54mbps , the actual rate that data moves across them is far lower .
the differing proposals for ways to speed up data rates on wi-fi are backed by different companies .
the tgn sync proposal has agere , intel and atheros as its backers .
the wwise idea is backed by texas instruments , broadcom and others .
by fiddling with the way wi-fi transmits data the wwise group claims it can reach speeds of 540mbps .
using a more standard approach the group believes it can boost speeds to 135mbps .
details about tgn sync are sketchy but it too is aiming for speeds in excess of 500mbps .
final decisions on the 802.11n standard are not expected before 2007 .

a team at edinburgh university made the conclusions while looking into the issues of truancy , parenting , gender and victimisation among young people .
they also found that pupils who bunk off are more likely to smoke and be drinking under age .
and at 15 , half of all truants are thought to be taking drugs .
the study is the latest in a series from the edinburgh study of youth transitions and crime , which tracks the 4,300 young people who transferred to secondary schools in edinburgh in the autumn of 1998 .
peers and parents have an important influence david smith edinburgh university they found girls tended to be involved with certain specific forms of delinquency - theft from home , writing graffiti , and truancy - more often than boys .
however , specific forms of more serious delinquency - carrying a weapon , housebreaking , robbery , theft from cars , and cruelty to animals - were much more common among boys than girls .
the reports also found parents played a crucial role in determining the pattern of their children 's behaviour as they became teenagers .
the key findings included ; only one in five persistent truants at primary were girls , but that increased to three in five by the third year of secondary in secondary school , 74 % of those excluded in the third year were boys 40 % of girls and 29 % of boys at 13 reported writing or spraying graffiti on property 59 % of 13-year-old boys admitted to fighting at 15 , boys were three times more likely than girls to carry a weapon and twice as likely to be involved in fighting and the kind of parenting a child aged 12 to 13 receives influences their delinquency at 15 .
david smith , professor of criminology at edinburgh university , said : " put simply , the findings show that good parenting can prevent crime .
" by contrast , parents who are inconsistent and harsh , and who easily give in to unreasonable demands , are more likely to see their teenage children turn to delinquency .
" the reports also demonstrate the influence of a wide range of other factors , from socio-economic status to the community and environment young people grow up in .
" but peers and parents have an important influence on top of these external factors . "

the multi-million pound project will create purpose-built accommodation for 1,000 students and should be completed in 2006 .
the university says the development , off south road in durham is a " firm commitment " to the collegiate system .
university officials hope the £ 35.5m project will allay concerns about the number of students living in the city of durham .
the new college will also provide new postgraduate student housing for the adjacent ustinov college and new residential facilities for st. cuthbert 's society with the replacement of three existing blocks at parson 's field .
student population professor tim burt , dean of colleges and student support services at the university , said : " we recognise the advantages of getting more students into collegiate facilities . "
he also acknowledged recent concerns from residents in durham city over the rising student population .
the university has expanded student numbers over the past 15 years in line with the policies of successive governments .
although it has already built about 1,000 extra rooms during the same period , the number of students who live out of college in rented housing has increased .
the new building programme will ensure that the majority of durham students will reside in university accommodation .
all durham students join one of the 15 colleges and societies .
unlike oxbridge colleges , durham colleges are not teaching bodies and neither , unlike halls of residence , are they purely residential .

gateshead borough council says it will have to pay tens of thousands of pounds after being sued and is now in a " no-win situation " .
public hostility to masts means almost all planning applications are opposed by residents - with most being refused .
the council says more phone firms are appealing against refusals and it must now decide how best to use public cash .
the authority says it is experiencing a " hardening of attitudes " by the mobile phone industry .
it highlights one applicant who has made a successful claim for legal costs against the authority , which means the council could now be facing a bill for tens of thousands of pounds .
gateshead council 's chairman of planning and development , joseph hattam , said that in future , councillors would have to consider even more carefully what weight they give to public opinion .
he said : " the outcome of these appeals is most unwelcome .
elected representatives " we are in a ' no win ' situation . "
" telephone masts generate huge public hostility , but if we listen to public opinion and refuse planning permission , then we run the risk of the applicant appealing against our decision , winning their appeal and building their mast anyway .
" the system appears to be helping the mobile phone companies to ignore the views of both the public and their elected representatives , and it seems there 's little we can do to stop them .
" this is not a happy state of affairs . "
in july , an all-party parliamentary committee on mobile phones , called for the planning system governing the siting of mobile phone masts to be radically overhauled .
it said phone firms should be made to seek full planning permission for mobile phone masts and base stations .
currently masts less than 15m high can be constructed without express permission .
the committee also said local councils were not doing enough to protect the public interest .

gateshead borough council says it will have to pay tens of thousands of pounds after being sued and is now in a " no-win situation " .
public hostility to masts means almost all planning applications are opposed by residents - with most being refused .
the council says more phone firms are appealing against refusals and it must now decide how best to use public cash .
the authority says it is experiencing a " hardening of attitudes " by the mobile phone industry .
it highlights one applicant who has made a successful claim for legal costs against the authority , which means the council could now be facing a bill for tens of thousands of pounds .
gateshead council 's chairman of planning and development , joseph hattam , said that in future , councillors would have to consider even more carefully what weight they give to public opinion .
he said : " the outcome of these appeals is most unwelcome .
elected representatives " we are in a ' no win ' situation . "
" telephone masts generate huge public hostility , but if we listen to public opinion and refuse planning permission , then we run the risk of the applicant appealing against our decision , winning their appeal and building their mast anyway .
" the system appears to be helping the mobile phone companies to ignore the views of both the public and their elected representatives , and it seems there 's little we can do to stop them .
" this is not a happy state of affairs . "
in july , an all-party parliamentary committee on mobile phones , called for the planning system governing the siting of mobile phone masts to be radically overhauled .
it said phone firms should be made to seek full planning permission for mobile phone masts and base stations .
currently masts less than 15m high can be constructed without express permission .
the committee also said local councils were not doing enough to protect the public interest .
