program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.11.2004 leipzig cheers dhl arrival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzigers ca n't wait to get their hands on dhl planes following a decision by deutsche post to move its european dhl parcel delivery service hub to leipzig , municipal authorities in the economically depressed region of eastern germany are over the moon . the new european hub of the courier company dhl is moving to leipzig , in the former east germany .
deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

leipzig ’ s municipal authorities are confident that legal proceedings initiated by locals against the enlargement of the airport will not jeopardize or postpone the project .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "

if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .

3 as a public holiday , the nation celebrated the anniversary many see as even more significant . but while east germans were welcomed with open arms by the west in 1989 , relations these days are characterized by animosity and mutual resentment .
often dubbed the most joyous day in german history , nov .
9 is now an anniversary overshadowed by what came after . where did it all go wrong ? anniversary with different east-west significance " as far as i 'm concerned , nov .
9 , 1989 , is a key date in world history , " insisted bundestag president wolfgang thierse , who comes from the eastern state of thuringen . " it 's even more significant then 9/11 , " he said in an interview on deutschland radio . christian democrat leader angela merkel , who also hails from eastern germany , echoed his feelings .
in an interview with die welt , she accused the chancellor of lacking interest in this aspect of germany 's past and suggested the recent plan to ditch german unity day was typical of his attitude to the troubled eastern part of the country . " the chancellor showed he completely lacks sensitivity regarding the significance of our national symbols , " she said .
" anyone who wants to trade in this anniversary for 0.1 percent economic growth clearly has no interest in german reunification . " ignorance and exploitation ? perhaps he 's not the only one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as politicians such as berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , social democrat leader franz müntefering and angela merkel laid wreaths tuesday at one of the last existing stretches of wall in berlin , others expressed mixed feelings about the direction germany has taken over the last 15 years and regretted the nation 's ignorance of what nov .
9 stands for . speaking in berlin 's " tränenpalast , " a former border crossing point named in memory of the many tears shed by friends and families forced to say goodbye on the friedrichstrasse , former chancellor helmut kohl expressed sadness at germany 's dwindling awareness of this chapter in its past .
often described as " the architect of unity " for his role in bringing the divided country together , he cited surveys that show one in three germans no longer have any idea what actually happened on nov .
9 , 1989 . during the discussion organized by the konrad adenauer foundation and the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , kohl and former east german civil rights lawyer bärbel bohley debated the fall of the wall and germany 's subsequent course . the man who famously predicted that germany would evolve into a " flourishing landscape " admitted his forecasts for economic growth had been well off the mark .
" i 'm angry at myself for mistakes made , " he told the audience . but he insisted the country could pull itself together .
" we may have some giant problems , but this country is healthy at its core , " he argued .
" the people can do it .
the problems can be fixed if we remain reasonable and work hard . " he also stressed he 'd always understood the scale of the task .
" in 1990 i said that a difficult path lay before us and we would need to make sacrifices , " he pointed out .
" but our economic problems can be resolved if not overnight then in the foreseeable future . " he was also keen to overturn the widespread perception of " ossis , " or eastern germans , as whingeing poor relations with a victim complex , instead laying blame with profiteering west germans .
" i was bitterly disappointed by some western managers , " he observed .
" they saw 17 million east germans as consumers , not as manufacturers .
they sold cars , furniture and shoes there but did n't want to produce there .
i did n't think that was possible . " west no longer an example wolfgang thierse lent weight to kohl 's criticism wednesday , telling the financial times deutschland that western germany no longer spearheads the country .

" the days when the east looks to the west as an example are long gone , " he said .
" for fifteen years the basic principle was that all the changes have to occur in the east , and the west can stay as it is .
now it 's time the whole country changed . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany marks its day of destiny tuesday marked the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , but nov .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "
the conservative opposition christian democrats have also attacked the penny-pinching plans as ineffective .
eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .
the budget expert said the finance minister 's chopping axe was ill-aimed and should spare the bundeswehr , given its currently stretched resources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .
necessary cuts eichel has defended the budget cuts as necessary to help reduce germany 's mounting deficit , which is currently hovering at a record € 43.7 billion .
after the failed attempt to save money by canceling the oct .
3 national unity holiday , eichel has focused on the government 's ministries and reining in their swelling expenses .
if germany does not rein in its debt , it risks once again violating the european union 's stability and growth pact , which requires all euro zone members to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.11.2004 eichel puts squeeze on defense budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budget cuts could hinder military reforms in an effort to rein in germany 's growing deficit , finance minister hans eichel has announced plans to push through massive cuts in the defense ministry .
reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "
the conservative opposition christian democrats have also attacked the penny-pinching plans as ineffective .
eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .
the budget expert said the finance minister 's chopping axe was ill-aimed and should spare the bundeswehr , given its currently stretched resources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .
necessary cuts eichel has defended the budget cuts as necessary to help reduce germany 's mounting deficit , which is currently hovering at a record € 43.7 billion .
after the failed attempt to save money by canceling the oct .
3 national unity holiday , eichel has focused on the government 's ministries and reining in their swelling expenses .
if germany does not rein in its debt , it risks once again violating the european union 's stability and growth pact , which requires all euro zone members to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

3 as a public holiday , the nation celebrated the anniversary many see as even more significant . but while east germans were welcomed with open arms by the west in 1989 , relations these days are characterized by animosity and mutual resentment .
often dubbed the most joyous day in german history , nov .
9 is now an anniversary overshadowed by what came after . where did it all go wrong ? anniversary with different east-west significance " as far as i 'm concerned , nov .
9 , 1989 , is a key date in world history , " insisted bundestag president wolfgang thierse , who comes from the eastern state of thuringen . " it 's even more significant then 9/11 , " he said in an interview on deutschland radio . christian democrat leader angela merkel , who also hails from eastern germany , echoed his feelings .
in an interview with die welt , she accused the chancellor of lacking interest in this aspect of germany 's past and suggested the recent plan to ditch german unity day was typical of his attitude to the troubled eastern part of the country . " the chancellor showed he completely lacks sensitivity regarding the significance of our national symbols , " she said .
" anyone who wants to trade in this anniversary for 0.1 percent economic growth clearly has no interest in german reunification . " ignorance and exploitation ? perhaps he 's not the only one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as politicians such as berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , social democrat leader franz müntefering and angela merkel laid wreaths tuesday at one of the last existing stretches of wall in berlin , others expressed mixed feelings about the direction germany has taken over the last 15 years and regretted the nation 's ignorance of what nov .
9 stands for . speaking in berlin 's " tränenpalast , " a former border crossing point named in memory of the many tears shed by friends and families forced to say goodbye on the friedrichstrasse , former chancellor helmut kohl expressed sadness at germany 's dwindling awareness of this chapter in its past .
often described as " the architect of unity " for his role in bringing the divided country together , he cited surveys that show one in three germans no longer have any idea what actually happened on nov .
9 , 1989 . during the discussion organized by the konrad adenauer foundation and the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , kohl and former east german civil rights lawyer bärbel bohley debated the fall of the wall and germany 's subsequent course . the man who famously predicted that germany would evolve into a " flourishing landscape " admitted his forecasts for economic growth had been well off the mark .
" i 'm angry at myself for mistakes made , " he told the audience . but he insisted the country could pull itself together .
" we may have some giant problems , but this country is healthy at its core , " he argued .
" the people can do it .
the problems can be fixed if we remain reasonable and work hard . " he also stressed he 'd always understood the scale of the task .
" in 1990 i said that a difficult path lay before us and we would need to make sacrifices , " he pointed out .
" but our economic problems can be resolved if not overnight then in the foreseeable future . " he was also keen to overturn the widespread perception of " ossis , " or eastern germans , as whingeing poor relations with a victim complex , instead laying blame with profiteering west germans .
" i was bitterly disappointed by some western managers , " he observed .
" they saw 17 million east germans as consumers , not as manufacturers .
they sold cars , furniture and shoes there but did n't want to produce there .
i did n't think that was possible . " west no longer an example wolfgang thierse lent weight to kohl 's criticism wednesday , telling the financial times deutschland that western germany no longer spearheads the country .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .

the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .

" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .

vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .
and it is expected that the party will increase its popularity when it relaunches this coming weekend . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point . -lrb- nov .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .
it 's taken 60 years , and six more months wo n't make much difference .

father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .
it 's taken 60 years , and six more months wo n't make much difference .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .
and it is expected that the party will increase its popularity when it relaunches this coming weekend . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point . -lrb- nov .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .
it 's taken 60 years , and six more months wo n't make much difference .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .
and it is expected that the party will increase its popularity when it relaunches this coming weekend . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point . -lrb- nov .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .

to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "
the conservative opposition christian democrats have also attacked the penny-pinching plans as ineffective .
eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .
the budget expert said the finance minister 's chopping axe was ill-aimed and should spare the bundeswehr , given its currently stretched resources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .
necessary cuts eichel has defended the budget cuts as necessary to help reduce germany 's mounting deficit , which is currently hovering at a record € 43.7 billion .
after the failed attempt to save money by canceling the oct .
3 national unity holiday , eichel has focused on the government 's ministries and reining in their swelling expenses .
if germany does not rein in its debt , it risks once again violating the european union 's stability and growth pact , which requires all euro zone members to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
germany has broken the pact for three years in a row and is widely expected to pass the limit again in 2005 .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .

the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .

the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .

the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .

we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .

vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .
and it is expected that the party will increase its popularity when it relaunches this coming weekend . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point . -lrb- nov .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .

in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .
it 's taken 60 years , and six more months wo n't make much difference .

the fear is that overseas investors might lose confidence in the debt-ridden us economy , placing their money elsewhere . analysts say market concerns about the deficits have increased in the wake of us president george w. bush 's re-election win last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when the trade data came out the euro-dollar knee-jerked lower on the idea that it was dollar-positive data , " said abn amro currency analyst paul mackel .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .
it 's taken 60 years , and six more months wo n't make much difference .

3 as a public holiday , the nation celebrated the anniversary many see as even more significant . but while east germans were welcomed with open arms by the west in 1989 , relations these days are characterized by animosity and mutual resentment .
often dubbed the most joyous day in german history , nov .
9 is now an anniversary overshadowed by what came after . where did it all go wrong ? anniversary with different east-west significance " as far as i 'm concerned , nov .
9 , 1989 , is a key date in world history , " insisted bundestag president wolfgang thierse , who comes from the eastern state of thuringen . " it 's even more significant then 9/11 , " he said in an interview on deutschland radio . christian democrat leader angela merkel , who also hails from eastern germany , echoed his feelings .
in an interview with die welt , she accused the chancellor of lacking interest in this aspect of germany 's past and suggested the recent plan to ditch german unity day was typical of his attitude to the troubled eastern part of the country . " the chancellor showed he completely lacks sensitivity regarding the significance of our national symbols , " she said .
" anyone who wants to trade in this anniversary for 0.1 percent economic growth clearly has no interest in german reunification .

9 stands for . speaking in berlin 's " tränenpalast , " a former border crossing point named in memory of the many tears shed by friends and families forced to say goodbye on the friedrichstrasse , former chancellor helmut kohl expressed sadness at germany 's dwindling awareness of this chapter in its past .
often described as " the architect of unity " for his role in bringing the divided country together , he cited surveys that show one in three germans no longer have any idea what actually happened on nov .
9 , 1989 . during the discussion organized by the konrad adenauer foundation and the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , kohl and former east german civil rights lawyer bärbel bohley debated the fall of the wall and germany 's subsequent course . the man who famously predicted that germany would evolve into a " flourishing landscape " admitted his forecasts for economic growth had been well off the mark .
" i 'm angry at myself for mistakes made , " he told the audience . but he insisted the country could pull itself together .
" we may have some giant problems , but this country is healthy at its core , " he argued .
" the people can do it .
the problems can be fixed if we remain reasonable and work hard . " he also stressed he 'd always understood the scale of the task .
" in 1990 i said that a difficult path lay before us and we would need to make sacrifices , " he pointed out .
" but our economic problems can be resolved if not overnight then in the foreseeable future . " he was also keen to overturn the widespread perception of " ossis , " or eastern germans , as whingeing poor relations with a victim complex , instead laying blame with profiteering west germans .
" i was bitterly disappointed by some western managers , " he observed .
" they saw 17 million east germans as consumers , not as manufacturers .
they sold cars , furniture and shoes there but did n't want to produce there .
i did n't think that was possible . " west no longer an example wolfgang thierse lent weight to kohl 's criticism wednesday , telling the financial times deutschland that western germany no longer spearheads the country .

" the days when the east looks to the west as an example are long gone , " he said .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .

if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.11.2004 leipzig cheers dhl arrival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzigers ca n't wait to get their hands on dhl planes following a decision by deutsche post to move its european dhl parcel delivery service hub to leipzig , municipal authorities in the economically depressed region of eastern germany are over the moon . the new european hub of the courier company dhl is moving to leipzig , in the former east germany .
deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .
and it is expected that the party will increase its popularity when it relaunches this coming weekend . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point . -lrb- nov .

" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .
and it is expected that the party will increase its popularity when it relaunches this coming weekend . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point . -lrb- nov .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .

towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "
the conservative opposition christian democrats have also attacked the penny-pinching plans as ineffective .
eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .
the budget expert said the finance minister 's chopping axe was ill-aimed and should spare the bundeswehr , given its currently stretched resources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .
necessary cuts eichel has defended the budget cuts as necessary to help reduce germany 's mounting deficit , which is currently hovering at a record € 43.7 billion .

3 national unity holiday , eichel has focused on the government 's ministries and reining in their swelling expenses .
if germany does not rein in its debt , it risks once again violating the european union 's stability and growth pact , which requires all euro zone members to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
germany has broken the pact for three years in a row and is widely expected to pass the limit again in 2005 .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .

eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

leipzig ’ s municipal authorities are confident that legal proceedings initiated by locals against the enlargement of the airport will not jeopardize or postpone the project .

airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .

we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .

so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .

anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .

vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.11.2004 eichel puts squeeze on defense budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budget cuts could hinder military reforms in an effort to rein in germany 's growing deficit , finance minister hans eichel has announced plans to push through massive cuts in the defense ministry .
reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "
the conservative opposition christian democrats have also attacked the penny-pinching plans as ineffective .
eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .
the budget expert said the finance minister 's chopping axe was ill-aimed and should spare the bundeswehr , given its currently stretched resources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .
necessary cuts eichel has defended the budget cuts as necessary to help reduce germany 's mounting deficit , which is currently hovering at a record € 43.7 billion .
after the failed attempt to save money by canceling the oct .
3 national unity holiday , eichel has focused on the government 's ministries and reining in their swelling expenses .
if germany does not rein in its debt , it risks once again violating the european union 's stability and growth pact , which requires all euro zone members to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
germany has broken the pact for three years in a row and is widely expected to pass the limit again in 2005 .
if that is the case it will face a series of penalties from the eu . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .
it 's taken 60 years , and six more months wo n't make much difference .

jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .

dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .

however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .

jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .

the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .

the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .

then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .

" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .

we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .

vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.11.2004 eichel puts squeeze on defense budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budget cuts could hinder military reforms in an effort to rein in germany 's growing deficit , finance minister hans eichel has announced plans to push through massive cuts in the defense ministry .
reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "
the conservative opposition christian democrats have also attacked the penny-pinching plans as ineffective .
eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .
the budget expert said the finance minister 's chopping axe was ill-aimed and should spare the bundeswehr , given its currently stretched resources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .
necessary cuts eichel has defended the budget cuts as necessary to help reduce germany 's mounting deficit , which is currently hovering at a record € 43.7 billion .
after the failed attempt to save money by canceling the oct .
3 national unity holiday , eichel has focused on the government 's ministries and reining in their swelling expenses .
if germany does not rein in its debt , it risks once again violating the european union 's stability and growth pact , which requires all euro zone members to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
germany has broken the pact for three years in a row and is widely expected to pass the limit again in 2005 .
if that is the case it will face a series of penalties from the eu . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.11.2004 eichel puts squeeze on defense budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budget cuts could hinder military reforms in an effort to rein in germany 's growing deficit , finance minister hans eichel has announced plans to push through massive cuts in the defense ministry .
reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "
the conservative opposition christian democrats have also attacked the penny-pinching plans as ineffective .
eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .
the budget expert said the finance minister 's chopping axe was ill-aimed and should spare the bundeswehr , given its currently stretched resources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .
necessary cuts eichel has defended the budget cuts as necessary to help reduce germany 's mounting deficit , which is currently hovering at a record € 43.7 billion .
after the failed attempt to save money by canceling the oct .
3 national unity holiday , eichel has focused on the government 's ministries and reining in their swelling expenses .
if germany does not rein in its debt , it risks once again violating the european union 's stability and growth pact , which requires all euro zone members to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
germany has broken the pact for three years in a row and is widely expected to pass the limit again in 2005 .
if that is the case it will face a series of penalties from the eu . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

3 as a public holiday , the nation celebrated the anniversary many see as even more significant . but while east germans were welcomed with open arms by the west in 1989 , relations these days are characterized by animosity and mutual resentment .
often dubbed the most joyous day in german history , nov .
9 is now an anniversary overshadowed by what came after . where did it all go wrong ? anniversary with different east-west significance " as far as i 'm concerned , nov .
9 , 1989 , is a key date in world history , " insisted bundestag president wolfgang thierse , who comes from the eastern state of thuringen . " it 's even more significant then 9/11 , " he said in an interview on deutschland radio . christian democrat leader angela merkel , who also hails from eastern germany , echoed his feelings .
in an interview with die welt , she accused the chancellor of lacking interest in this aspect of germany 's past and suggested the recent plan to ditch german unity day was typical of his attitude to the troubled eastern part of the country . " the chancellor showed he completely lacks sensitivity regarding the significance of our national symbols , " she said .
" anyone who wants to trade in this anniversary for 0.1 percent economic growth clearly has no interest in german reunification . " ignorance and exploitation ? perhaps he 's not the only one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as politicians such as berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit , social democrat leader franz müntefering and angela merkel laid wreaths tuesday at one of the last existing stretches of wall in berlin , others expressed mixed feelings about the direction germany has taken over the last 15 years and regretted the nation 's ignorance of what nov .
9 stands for . speaking in berlin 's " tränenpalast , " a former border crossing point named in memory of the many tears shed by friends and families forced to say goodbye on the friedrichstrasse , former chancellor helmut kohl expressed sadness at germany 's dwindling awareness of this chapter in its past .
often described as " the architect of unity " for his role in bringing the divided country together , he cited surveys that show one in three germans no longer have any idea what actually happened on nov .
9 , 1989 . during the discussion organized by the konrad adenauer foundation and the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , kohl and former east german civil rights lawyer bärbel bohley debated the fall of the wall and germany 's subsequent course . the man who famously predicted that germany would evolve into a " flourishing landscape " admitted his forecasts for economic growth had been well off the mark .
" i 'm angry at myself for mistakes made , " he told the audience . but he insisted the country could pull itself together .
" we may have some giant problems , but this country is healthy at its core , " he argued .
" the people can do it .
the problems can be fixed if we remain reasonable and work hard . " he also stressed he 'd always understood the scale of the task .
" in 1990 i said that a difficult path lay before us and we would need to make sacrifices , " he pointed out .
" but our economic problems can be resolved if not overnight then in the foreseeable future . " he was also keen to overturn the widespread perception of " ossis , " or eastern germans , as whingeing poor relations with a victim complex , instead laying blame with profiteering west germans .
" i was bitterly disappointed by some western managers , " he observed .
" they saw 17 million east germans as consumers , not as manufacturers .
they sold cars , furniture and shoes there but did n't want to produce there .
i did n't think that was possible . " west no longer an example wolfgang thierse lent weight to kohl 's criticism wednesday , telling the financial times deutschland that western germany no longer spearheads the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berlin while the enormous cost of reunification - € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.61 trillion -rrb- in public funds invested in the east since 1990 - have left many westerners bitter over the sacrifices they have made , thierse insisted it was time to overhaul germany 's prevailing mentality .
" the days when the east looks to the west as an example are long gone , " he said .
" for fifteen years the basic principle was that all the changes have to occur in the east , and the west can stay as it is .
now it 's time the whole country changed . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany marks its day of destiny tuesday marked the 15th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , but nov .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.11.2004 leipzig cheers dhl arrival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzigers ca n't wait to get their hands on dhl planes following a decision by deutsche post to move its european dhl parcel delivery service hub to leipzig , municipal authorities in the economically depressed region of eastern germany are over the moon . the new european hub of the courier company dhl is moving to leipzig , in the former east germany .
deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .

of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.11.2004 leipzig cheers dhl arrival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzigers ca n't wait to get their hands on dhl planes following a decision by deutsche post to move its european dhl parcel delivery service hub to leipzig , municipal authorities in the economically depressed region of eastern germany are over the moon . the new european hub of the courier company dhl is moving to leipzig , in the former east germany .
deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "
the conservative opposition christian democrats have also attacked the penny-pinching plans as ineffective .
eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .
the budget expert said the finance minister 's chopping axe was ill-aimed and should spare the bundeswehr , given its currently stretched resources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .
necessary cuts eichel has defended the budget cuts as necessary to help reduce germany 's mounting deficit , which is currently hovering at a record € 43.7 billion .
after the failed attempt to save money by canceling the oct .
3 national unity holiday , eichel has focused on the government 's ministries and reining in their swelling expenses .
if germany does not rein in its debt , it risks once again violating the european union 's stability and growth pact , which requires all euro zone members to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
germany has broken the pact for three years in a row and is widely expected to pass the limit again in 2005 .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.11.2004 eichel puts squeeze on defense budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budget cuts could hinder military reforms in an effort to rein in germany 's growing deficit , finance minister hans eichel has announced plans to push through massive cuts in the defense ministry .
reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "
the conservative opposition christian democrats have also attacked the penny-pinching plans as ineffective .
eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .
the budget expert said the finance minister 's chopping axe was ill-aimed and should spare the bundeswehr , given its currently stretched resources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .
necessary cuts eichel has defended the budget cuts as necessary to help reduce germany 's mounting deficit , which is currently hovering at a record € 43.7 billion .
after the failed attempt to save money by canceling the oct .
3 national unity holiday , eichel has focused on the government 's ministries and reining in their swelling expenses .
if germany does not rein in its debt , it risks once again violating the european union 's stability and growth pact , which requires all euro zone members to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
germany has broken the pact for three years in a row and is widely expected to pass the limit again in 2005 .
if that is the case it will face a series of penalties from the eu . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .
it 's taken 60 years , and six more months wo n't make much difference .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .

he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .

he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .

the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .

but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.11.2004 eichel puts squeeze on defense budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budget cuts could hinder military reforms in an effort to rein in germany 's growing deficit , finance minister hans eichel has announced plans to push through massive cuts in the defense ministry .
reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "
the conservative opposition christian democrats have also attacked the penny-pinching plans as ineffective .
eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .
the budget expert said the finance minister 's chopping axe was ill-aimed and should spare the bundeswehr , given its currently stretched resources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .
necessary cuts eichel has defended the budget cuts as necessary to help reduce germany 's mounting deficit , which is currently hovering at a record € 43.7 billion .
after the failed attempt to save money by canceling the oct .
3 national unity holiday , eichel has focused on the government 's ministries and reining in their swelling expenses .
if germany does not rein in its debt , it risks once again violating the european union 's stability and growth pact , which requires all euro zone members to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
germany has broken the pact for three years in a row and is widely expected to pass the limit again in 2005 .
if that is the case it will face a series of penalties from the eu . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

reports put the amount at about 250 million euros . according to a report published in wednesday 's edition of die welt , eichel needs to save some additional two billion euros from germany 's government budget for 2005 .
to meet that goal , the german military is expected to shave off some € 250 million -lrb- $ 322 million -rrb- from its budget , leaving it with a meager € 24 billion for operating next year .
in the past , defense minister peter struck has opposed such cuts to the bundeswehr , claiming its effectiveness and the current reform process to turn the german military into a modern force would be adversely affected .
but given the current state of the german deficit and eichel 's need to fill the growing holes in the state coffers , it is unlikely the military will be spared from hard-hitting cuts .
disproportionate cuts defense expert for the social democrats elke leonhard has criticized eichel 's plans for cutting the military 's budget , saying the defense ministry had to carry a disproportionate burden compared to other ministries .
leonhard told the newspaper that the budget cuts needed to be limited to the upcoming year and should not interfere with mid and long-term planning for the future of the armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr recruits the budget cuts should not come at the expense of the current reform investments or personnel , she said , otherwise the military will have reached " the end of its tether . "
the conservative opposition christian democrats have also attacked the penny-pinching plans as ineffective .
eichel 's budget proposal " has more wholes in it than swiss cheese , " dietrich austermann told die welt .
the budget expert said the finance minister 's chopping axe was ill-aimed and should spare the bundeswehr , given its currently stretched resources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further will the military be able to go with the current budget ?
if eichel 's proposal goes through , the reforms to the german military are doomed to fail , austermann said .
struck would never be able to do anything more with the armed forces , he added .
necessary cuts eichel has defended the budget cuts as necessary to help reduce germany 's mounting deficit , which is currently hovering at a record € 43.7 billion .
after the failed attempt to save money by canceling the oct .
3 national unity holiday , eichel has focused on the government 's ministries and reining in their swelling expenses .
if germany does not rein in its debt , it risks once again violating the european union 's stability and growth pact , which requires all euro zone members to maintain a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
germany has broken the pact for three years in a row and is widely expected to pass the limit again in 2005 .
if that is the case it will face a series of penalties from the eu . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eichel presents eu-friendly budget revenues of about € 5 billion compared with an austerity package of € 8 billion : its germany 's plan for meeting the euro-zone stability criteria in the coming years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.11.2004 campaigning for cologne 's maligned resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- right , with guitar -rrb- and his fellow edelweiss pirates they wore their hair long , sang songs by banned jewish composers and fought the nazi regime .
but history has so far remembered cologne 's edelweiss pirates as criminals rather than resistance fighters ... until now . on november 10th 1944 , the gestapo hanged 13 people in a residential street in cologne without trial .
six of those killed were teenagers , members of an underground group called the edelweiss pirates .
an alternative movement to the hitler youth , the edelweiss pirates grew their hair long and risked arrest , torture and their lives to carry out small acts of sabotage against the nazi regime .
sixty years later they are still officially listed as petty thieves and criminals .
their acts of resistance - while having been recognized by the state of israel - have not yet been officially acknowledged here in germany .
that ’ s about to change with a new initiative by the district president of cologne jürgen peters who wants to rehabilitate the edelweiss pirates .
while the city of cologne debates the acknowledgement of the pirates ' war efforts , jean jülich , a surviving member of the group , has published his memoirs and is supporting an upcoming film about the pirates , due for release on the 60th anniversary of his friends ' execution .
father 's internment a pivotal moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich .
born in 1929 , in the working class cologne suburb of sülz , jean was just seven years old when his father , a member of the communist party , was arrested by the gestapo .
" in 1936 , sometime in the morning they turned up in grandma 's apartment - my father was in the toilet , he 'd hidden himself there - they pulled him out and bashed him up and down the corridor , he was bleeding from his mouth and nose , his face was swollen - it was really horrible .
then they took him away . "
jean ’ s father was sentenced to 10 years with hard labor for belonging to the communist party .
his grandmother and aunt were also imprisoned for six months and jean was placed in an orphanage until they were released .
the experience led jean to distrust the nazi ’ s and the hitler youth , which he rejected in favor of the free living , romantic youth group called the edelweiss pirates .
besides , he said , the daily drills of the hitler youth were too boring .
" then i was put into a nazi reichsbahn training center in nippes - it consisted of a factory , school , hitler youth – all in one , and in the morning you reported in - heil hitler , if you wanted to go to the loo it was heil hitler , heil hitler reporting back , the whole day long your hand went up and down , and i really hated that . "
hiking songs and anti-nazi leaflets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean jülich -lrb- center -rrb- survived the nazi purge on the pirates .
towards the end of world war two , there were about 3000 edelweiss pirates in cologne and several hundred more in neighboring cities .
they developed out of a youth hiking movement called the " bündische jugend " which was neither aligned to a political party nor a church but there was no organized structure and several loose groupings of edelweiss pirates existed in each suburb of cologne .
with the rise of the nazi ’ s in the thirties , these young people refused to join the hitler youth .
they were like any other teenagers rebelling against the authorities .
however this was a totalitarian state and rebelling could cost you your life .
dr nicola wenge is a historian at the nazi documentation center in cologne , which is housed in the city ’ s former gestapo headquarters .
according to dr wenge the edelweiss pirates established their own subculture in the rhine-ruhr region by wearing a certain style of clothing , singing their own romantic ballads and later anti-nazi ditties .
unlike the nazi youth organizations , girls and boys interacted together and traveled for weekend hiking trips to nearby konigsforst .
" for this reason they were persecuted by the hitler youth , the police , the gestapo and even the nazi judiciary and branded as criminals , sexual deviants and as threat to the state , " says dr wenge .
opposition gathered pace as war raged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the allies flattened cologne from the air , the pirates fought the hitler youth on the ground .
as the allied bombing of cologne intensified , the city , as well as public order crumbled , and the childish pranks and fisticuffs with the hitler youth grew more serious .
jean jülich and his band of friends took to throwing bricks through munitions factories and pouring sugar water into the petrol tanks of cars belonging to nazis .
other groups derailed train carriages loaded with munitions or distributed leaflets critical of the regime .
in 1944 , jean along with several of his friends were arrested for allegedly being involved with a man called hans steinbruck or bomber hans who was reportedly plotting to bomb the gestapo headquarters in cologne .
jean was fifteen years old and spent four months in a tiny cell at the brauweiler prison on the outskirts of cologne .
he and the other prisoners were interrogated and tortured by the gestapo .
and then one day , jean said some of his friends , including bartholomaeus schink were taken away .
in all , 13 people were hanged early in the morning on the tenth of november 1944 .
among the six executed was the youngest , 16 year old pirate schink .
the street is now named after him but he and the others executed that day are still officially listed as criminals .
dr nicola wenge believes the edelweiss pirates should be rehabilitated as victims of the nazi regime , but she is cautious not to apply the term ‘ resistance fighters ’ .
" i think one has to differentiate the term ‘ resistance ’ .
but primarily i would describe it as resistant or opposition conduct . "
however she adds that actions such as distributing leaflets , or chalking slogans on the walls like " down with the dictatorship " or pulling down nazi flags required considerable courage and could be regarded as a form of youth resistance .
however , the label of criminals in cologne remain .
even the state of israel has recognized that some form of opposition existed in wartime cologne .
in 1984 , the israeli holocaust martyrs ’ and heroes ’ remembrance authority , yad vashem , awarded jean jülich , and bartholomaeus schink , with its highest accolade for their actions .
jean said receiving the medal and travelling to jerusalem to plant a tree in the yad vashem garden was wonderful and positive experience for his entire family .
now the case has been reopened and the new district governor of cologne jürgen roters wants to fully rehabilitate the group .
he says he wants to lift the stigma of crime that still surrounds this youth movement .
local heroes and a feature film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both boys and girls were members of the cologne resistance .
the edelweiss pirates have become local heroes in cologne and are due to be immortalized in film .
the director nico von glasow said he made the film after being surprised to discover the existence of this group .
he says like many germans he knew nothing about the edelweiss pirates despite having grown up in cologne .
" and i wanted to know why i had not heard about them and i asked my friend jean jülich and he said something very interesting .
he said that if there is one hero in the country then the rest of the country could say they knew nothing about what was going on .
but if there is one hero on every street , then it looks bad for the rest of the street . "
the rehabilitation of the edelweiss pirates has once again touched upon the sense of collective post war guilt in germany .
while many argue that it ’ s important to regain a stronger sense of self consciousness by acknowledging that there was a resistance against the nazis , others caution against a tendency to focus on those exceptions at the risk of forgetting the greater proportion of the population who did nothing .
after the war , jean jülich received a certificate acknowledging the four months he had spent in jail and recognizing that the had been politically persecuted .
and although jean jülich has never called himself a resistance fighter , he says it ’ s important that the memories of his friends are finally restored .
" and i have faith , okay i 've always had faith , but in this case , i really believe that my dead friends will at least be rehabilitated and will no longer be portrayed as criminals .
i do n't have any problems because i 've got my certificate .
but this case needs to be processed by the district governor roters and that ca n't happen overnight .
it 's taken 60 years , and six more months wo n't make much difference .

a secretary became suspicious when an unmarked package arrived at the office of the regional president of the unterfranken region of the state , paul beinhofer , and alerted police .
the bomb did not detonate and no one was injured .
state prosecutors said the explosive appeared to resemble those used in a series of letter bombs sent to officials in bavaria since april , particularly because a majority of the addressees came from the same part of the state .
the first six packages were sent to regional politicians from the center-left social democrats and the conservative christian social union .
although police have dna traces from the suspected perpetrator and have conducted widespread genetic testing in the region , they have few leads . more briefs 10.11.2004 -pipe- german foreign minister rules out war with iran 09.11.2004 -pipe- ullrich irked by tour de france changes 09.11.2004 -pipe- nuclear train reaches german depot 09.11.2004 -pipe- jewish leader warns of far-right rise 08.11.2004 -pipe- alarming number of poor children in germany 08.11.2004 -pipe- french designer wins lucky strike award in berlin 08.11.2004 -pipe- oliver kahn faces stiff competition in national team 04.11.2004 -pipe- human trafficking ring broken up in germany , britain radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a secretary became suspicious when an unmarked package arrived at the office of the regional president of the unterfranken region of the state , paul beinhofer , and alerted police .
the bomb did not detonate and no one was injured .
state prosecutors said the explosive appeared to resemble those used in a series of letter bombs sent to officials in bavaria since april , particularly because a majority of the addressees came from the same part of the state .
the first six packages were sent to regional politicians from the center-left social democrats and the conservative christian social union .
although police have dna traces from the suspected perpetrator and have conducted widespread genetic testing in the region , they have few leads . more briefs 10.11.2004 -pipe- german foreign minister rules out war with iran 09.11.2004 -pipe- ullrich irked by tour de france changes 09.11.2004 -pipe- nuclear train reaches german depot 09.11.2004 -pipe- jewish leader warns of far-right rise 08.11.2004 -pipe- alarming number of poor children in germany 08.11.2004 -pipe- french designer wins lucky strike award in berlin 08.11.2004 -pipe- oliver kahn faces stiff competition in national team 04.11.2004 -pipe- human trafficking ring broken up in germany , britain radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .

deutsche post , dhl ’ s parent company , announced on tuesday that leipzig won out over vatry , france , in dhl ’ s search for a hub to replace the one in brussels from the year 2008 . this could bring 10,000 new jobs to the leipzig area - welcome news in eastern germany , which has suffered rising unemployment over the last few years . by the year 2012 , dhl is expected to have created 3,500 jobs in leipzig - and that will bring about the indirect creation of another 7,000 jobs .
in total , dhl will invest about € 300 million -lrb- $ 389.7 million -rrb- in the area . dhl 's business has been growing steadily and is now the world 's leading express and logistics company , with around 170,000 employees worldwide . with dhl on board , the leipzig airport will record an estimated 125,000 flights annually as of 2008 .
the airport currently records some 40,000 flights a year . a beacon of hope since german unification in 1990 , the saxon town of leipzig has been one of only a few beacons of hope in the otherwise economically depressed eastern federal states .
the traditional east-west trade city boasts one of the country ’ s most modern fairgrounds hosting a renowned book fair and other international events on an annual basis .
last year , leipzig celebrated the opening of new porsche and bmw car making facilities . although the hub wo n't be fully operational until 2008 , municipal authorities are already over the moon about the deal they were able to strike .
the mayor of leipzig , wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- photo -rrb- , was happy about the announcement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we are beside ourselves , " he told reporters .
" we have opened the champagne bottles and are very , very happy that dhl has given its trust to the leipzig / halle region . i 'm eternally thankful that those responsible put their energy into making sure that the decision would come out this way . " german chancellor gerhard schröder also praised the decision .
he called it a good day for the eastern part of germany and said it showed that the government 's measures to rebuild the east were successful . a desperate need for jobs experts say that having dhl in leipzig wo n't drive out other industry in the region because there are large numbers of unemployed with lower and middle level qualifications ; how many of the new jobs will be low-paying , low-level positions will depend on how much management dhl decides also to move to leipzig . tiefensee said that his city was in need of jobs as the region mounts its slow economic recovery . " we ought not forget that unemployment in the leipzig region - that 's about one-third of the state of saxony - still remains around 18 percent , " he said .
" we have already accomplished a lot , comparatively , but out of a really difficult situation - so far high unemployment that could only be brought down a little bit .
we expect the effects of our efforts in the next 10 to 15 years - right now they 're difficult to notice . " some concerns about airport expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig airport the airport in leipzig itself will be built up so that it can handle dhl , and the situation will thereby improve for other airlines as well .
the state of saxony is going to match dhl 's investment by putting another € 300 million towards the extension of the airport and building an additional runway .
dhl had to move its main european hub out of brussels because there is a ban on night flights at the airport ; there is n't such a ban in leipzig . but the expected increase in noise levels in the vicinity of the airport is already raising the hackles of some locals and pressure groups .
airport officials are confident , though , that legal action against the new hub will not jeopardize the project . passenger numbers have been stagnating of late , according to deputy mayor of the airport district of schkeuditz , manfred heumos . " after german unification , easterners were euphoric about flying to far-away destinations , " he said .
" going on holiday two or three times a year and making use of their newly won freedom of travel was the rule for many .
but that ’ s no longer the case .
the number of air passengers here in our region has dropped again , at least as far as holiday makers are concerned .
the situation has returned to normal , and people tend to save their money for a rainy day or invest it in their homes or flats .
so , it ’ s very good that the airport will now also be used for freight transport to make up for stagnating passenger numbers . ” jochen partier from the tiny village of kursdorf near the airport is looking ahead to the airport ’ s enlargement with mixed feelings . " the development of our airport has brought many people new jobs , especially after the political changes in 1989-90 , " he said .
" but with the airport , problems increased too .
for example , the noise at the airport increases and increases and not only the airport but also the other connections , for example the train connections and the highway , these are now the most important problems . " airport officials pledge to cooperate but susanne trumpler from the airport ’ s public relations department claims that local residents ’ worries are being taken seriously by the management . " of course people in kursdorf are affected by the airport , by noise , " she said .
" but we want to limit the effects , they receive special windows for instance so that noise doesn ’ t come into the rooms .
we have good relations with the people since a lot of them work here at the airport , the unemployment rate in this village is very , very low .
you can say the rate is going to zero . " nevertheless , airport enlargement opponents have already lodged over 3,000 complaints voicing their fears about increased noise pollution .
it 's something that farmer achim knauf can ’ t relate to . " well , i ’ ve lived here for 44 years now and have build up a new life for myself , " he said .
" and we ’ ve always had the airport as our neighbor .
i ’ ve grown old with it , as it were .
of course , i ’ d never have thought that the airport would become so big one day , but that ’ s no reason for me to quit things and leave the village .
i ’ ve sort of got used to the noise around us here .
they built a wall to reduce the noise .
we also got sound-proof windows in our homes and we received some compensation for the impaired use of our plots of land .
if i lived in the middle of a city with a tram thundering by every other minute i ’ d probably be much worse off . "

" it 's even more significant then 9/11 , " he said in an interview on deutschland radio . christian democrat leader angela merkel , who also hails from eastern germany , echoed his feelings .
in an interview with die welt , she accused the chancellor of lacking interest in this aspect of germany 's past and suggested the recent plan to ditch german unity day was typical of his attitude to the troubled eastern part of the country . " the chancellor showed he completely lacks sensitivity regarding the significance of our national symbols , " she said .
" anyone who wants to trade in this anniversary for 0.1 percent economic growth clearly has no interest in german reunification .

9 stands for . speaking in berlin 's " tränenpalast , " a former border crossing point named in memory of the many tears shed by friends and families forced to say goodbye on the friedrichstrasse , former chancellor helmut kohl expressed sadness at germany 's dwindling awareness of this chapter in its past .

9 , 1989 . during the discussion organized by the konrad adenauer foundation and the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , kohl and former east german civil rights lawyer bärbel bohley debated the fall of the wall and germany 's subsequent course . the man who famously predicted that germany would evolve into a " flourishing landscape " admitted his forecasts for economic growth had been well off the mark .
" i 'm angry at myself for mistakes made , " he told the audience . but he insisted the country could pull itself together .
" we may have some giant problems , but this country is healthy at its core , " he argued .
" the people can do it .
the problems can be fixed if we remain reasonable and work hard . " he also stressed he 'd always understood the scale of the task .
" in 1990 i said that a difficult path lay before us and we would need to make sacrifices , " he pointed out .
" but our economic problems can be resolved if not overnight then in the foreseeable future . " he was also keen to overturn the widespread perception of " ossis , " or eastern germans , as whingeing poor relations with a victim complex , instead laying blame with profiteering west germans .
" i was bitterly disappointed by some western managers , " he observed .
" they saw 17 million east germans as consumers , not as manufacturers .
they sold cars , furniture and shoes there but did n't want to produce there .
i did n't think that was possible . " west no longer an example wolfgang thierse lent weight to kohl 's criticism wednesday , telling the financial times deutschland that western germany no longer spearheads the country .

" the days when the east looks to the west as an example are long gone , " he said .

3 as a public holiday , the nation celebrated the anniversary many see as even more significant . but while east germans were welcomed with open arms by the west in 1989 , relations these days are characterized by animosity and mutual resentment .
often dubbed the most joyous day in german history , nov .
9 is now an anniversary overshadowed by what came after . where did it all go wrong ? anniversary with different east-west significance " as far as i 'm concerned , nov .
9 , 1989 , is a key date in world history , " insisted bundestag president wolfgang thierse , who comes from the eastern state of thuringen . " it 's even more significant then 9/11 , " he said in an interview on deutschland radio . christian democrat leader angela merkel , who also hails from eastern germany , echoed his feelings .
in an interview with die welt , she accused the chancellor of lacking interest in this aspect of germany 's past and suggested the recent plan to ditch german unity day was typical of his attitude to the troubled eastern part of the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.11.2004 belgium bans popular " racist " party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vlaams blok leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- dewinter , annemans , vanhecke while the netherlands reels from a spate of attacks against muslims , belgium 's top court has dealt a temporary blow to one of europe 's most successful anti-immigrant parties , vlaams blok , by declaring it racist . belgium 's supreme court on tuesday voted to uphold a verdict by a lower court in april that found the far-right nationalist party guilty of " permanent incitement to segregation and racism . "
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .
and it is expected that the party will increase its popularity when it relaunches this coming weekend . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point . -lrb- nov .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .

the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .

vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .

vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .

this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .

the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .

in the report , drawn up at the request of german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka in a bid to ease simmering tensions , professors jan barcz of warsaw and jochen a. frowein of heidelberg said that there was " no legal basis " for the demands .
they said a statement by schröder in warsaw in august ruling out the demands was " a unilateral act of the federal republic of germany , binding from the point of view of international law … the federal government is thus clearly excluding a legal appeal on the demands from germany to poland and considers such demands as being without legal foundation , " the report said . more briefs 10.11.2004 -pipe- germany to fly nationals out of ivory coast 10.11.2004 -pipe- letter bomb sent to regional leader 10.11.2004 -pipe- german foreign minister rules out war with iran 09.11.2004 -pipe- ullrich irked by tour de france changes 09.11.2004 -pipe- nuclear train reaches german depot 09.11.2004 -pipe- jewish leader warns of far-right rise 08.11.2004 -pipe- alarming number of poor children in germany 08.11.2004 -pipe- french designer wins lucky strike award in berlin radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" i do not think that we are heading anytime soon into a confrontation similar to the one in iraq , " fischer told german news weekly stern in an issue to be published thursday .
" i think it is clear to all those involved that war is not an option , " he said , adding that he believed this was also the view held by the united states and israel .
fischer said he was nevertheless worried by iran 's atomic ambitions , noting that tehran acquiring a nuclear bomb " would have unforeseeable consequences in one of the most dangerous regions in the world … that would not only threaten israel but europe as well . "
fischer said germany would continue to pursue talks with iran along with its partners in britain and france .
he said it was " too early " to discuss economic sanctions to put pressure on tehran . dw-world.de dw-world : iran demands more eu flexibility on nuke deal a top iranian regime official has warned britain , france and germany that the islamic republic could harden its stance if the eu failed to show flexibility in the stalled nuclear negotiations .

a secretary became suspicious when an unmarked package arrived at the office of the regional president of the unterfranken region of the state , paul beinhofer , and alerted police .
the bomb did not detonate and no one was injured .
state prosecutors said the explosive appeared to resemble those used in a series of letter bombs sent to officials in bavaria since april , particularly because a majority of the addressees came from the same part of the state .
the first six packages were sent to regional politicians from the center-left social democrats and the conservative christian social union .
although police have dna traces from the suspected perpetrator and have conducted widespread genetic testing in the region , they have few leads . more briefs 10.11.2004 -pipe- german foreign minister rules out war with iran 09.11.2004 -pipe- ullrich irked by tour de france changes 09.11.2004 -pipe- nuclear train reaches german depot 09.11.2004 -pipe- jewish leader warns of far-right rise 08.11.2004 -pipe- alarming number of poor children in germany 08.11.2004 -pipe- french designer wins lucky strike award in berlin 08.11.2004 -pipe- oliver kahn faces stiff competition in national team 04.11.2004 -pipe- human trafficking ring broken up in germany , britain radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
the justices rejected all 21 arguments put forward by the vlaams blok in an appeal case , arguing that freedom of speech had its limits under the country 's tough anti-racism legislation .
the verdict effectively shuts down one of belgium 's most popular parties by cutting it off from some € 250,000 -lrb- $ 325,000 -rrb- in annual public funding .
anti-racist activists , who have lobbied to keep the party , which espouses anti-immigrant policies and advocates secession , out of the country 's politics , applauded the court 's decision .
but vlaams blok leader frank vanhecke likened the ruling to legislation applied by the former communist states in eastern europe .
" what happened in brussels today is unique in the western world : never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country 's largest political party , " he said in a statement tuesday .
vlaams blok has now vowed to regroup and return with an even stronger voter basis .
" we will establish a new party .
this one belgium will not be able to bury ; it will bury belgium , " vanhecke said .
popular support for anti-immigration the party 's popularity is unlikely to be diminished by tuesday 's court decision .
two recent opinion polls ranked vlaams block the most popular party in the flemish-speaking north , where it won 24 percent of votes in june 's regional elections .
in national elections in may last year , the party posted its best performance in its 26-year history by taking 18 seats in belgium 's national parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filip dewinter and family during parliamentary elections in may 2003 , when vlaams block increased their seats to 18 .
the party , which made a name for itself by campaigning for the richer , dutch-speaking region of flanders to secede from the southern french-speaking part of belgium , said the brussels ' court verdict did not amount to much .
it will continue to exist with the same ideals but would re-establish itself under a new name , either " vlaams blok + " or " vlaams belang " -lrb- the flemish interest -rrb- , vanhecke said .
although the new version of the party will no longer advocate the forcible expulsion of non-european immigrants -lrb- as decreed by the court -rrb- , it will continue to push for the departure of minorities " who reject , deny or fight against culture and european values like the separation of church and state , freedom of expression and equality between men and women , " a statement said .
just a face-lift ?
observers and even party-insiders have said the court 's ruling will have little effect on altering vlaams blok 's anti-immigrant position .
party co-leader filip dewinter has promised to come back from the verdict with a fighting spirit .
" some say this is just a matter of face-lifting .
i do n't think so , " he told deutsche welle .
" the vlaams blok is having a manicure .
we will sharpen our teeth and nails and emerge from this stronger , more determined and better than ever . "
" we are a modern party of the nationalist right .
we are now the reference point in europe , " the charismatic dewinter said in monday 's edition of het laatste nieuws .
vlaams blok has been part of the resurgence of extreme right , anti-immigrant parties throughout europe , from the austrian freedom party of jörg haider to jean-marie le pen 's national front in france and the dutch lijst pim fortuyn , named after the murdered populist who established it .
the current wave of anti-muslim attacks across the border in the netherlands following the murder of the controversial film director theo van gogh has also added fuel to vlaams blok 's campaign to keep non-european immigrants out of belgium if they do not adopt the country 's rules and western values .
and it is expected that the party will increase its popularity when it relaunches this coming weekend . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point . -lrb- nov .

data on the movements of 16 albatrosses and three petrel species was collated by birdlife international .
its report , tracking ocean wanderers , identifies the ocean hotspots where the birds tend to congregate .
about 300,000 seabirds , including 100,000 albatrosses , are thought to be killed each year when they are hooked on the longlines of fishing boats .
it is hoped the information can be used by fishing fleets to tailor their activities so that they do least harm to the birds .
" this report shows the variation throughout the year - there are particular times when it is critical for the birds to be in certain areas , " said cleo small , of the international marine policy office at birdlife , an alliance of conservation groups .
" fisheries can now be more sophisticated ; they will know that in certain months in particular places they will need to take more care . "
long journeys the hotspots where both longliners and large numbers of seabirds cross paths include the waters around new zealand and south-east australia , the south-west indian ocean , south atlantic and north pacific . "
it brings together real data for the first time to show us where these gravely threatened birds are roving the oceans " prince charles the study also emphasised the importance of coastal shelf areas for albatrosses and petrels while breeding , and of highly productive oceanic regions such as the humboldt current , the patagonian shelf , the antarctic polar frontal zone , and the benguela current .
it identified differences in foraging areas used by breeding and non-breeding adults , and young and mature birds .
and the project underlined the huge distances travelled on migration by some of these majestic birds .
the northern royal albatross , for example , flies up to 1,800km in 24 hours , and the grey-headed albatross can circle the globe in 42 days .
concern for the welfare of these ocean birds - all 21 albatross species are officially classed as under global threat of extinction - has prompted interested nations to sign up to a treaty .
pirate vessels the parties to the agreement on the conservation of albatrosses and petrels -lrb- acap -rrb- are meeting for the first time , in tasmania , this week .
the treaty requires signatory states to implement conservation measures .
john croxall , head of conservation biology at the british antarctic survey , said : " the data , and the results presented in this report , will be of immense assistance in developing the work of the new acap . "
the prince of wales , who is a keen supporter of albatross conservation , has also commended the work of the project .
" it brings together real data for the first time to show us where these gravely threatened birds are roving the oceans , enabling us to identify where they are most vulnerable and to safeguard their critical habitat , " he said .
although the data will help legitimate fisheries modify practices for the benefit of sea birds , there exist many pirate boats on the world 's oceans which work outside international law .
the pirates are thought to account for one third of seabird deaths by longlining .
efforts to conserve the albatross have somehow to constrain this activity too .

they said they owed it to the families of all the victims , including that of car driver brian drysdale , 48 , to find out how he came to be there .
police have examined his mobile phone - found near the scene - and are not ruling out suicide .
mr drysdale 's colleagues said they were " shocked " by news of his involvement .
the chef , who lived in reading , left work less than an hour before the derailment , in which he and six others died .
etta said she had lost her son but she knew that other people have lost their loved ones as well dayline vickers , family friend a spokesman for wokefield park golf complex , near mortimer , berkshire , confirmed mr drysdale had been at work on saturday and left at around 5.30pm.
he had been employed there for the last 15 months , and was described as a " valued member of the catering team " .
mr drysdale 's route between work and his home in reading would have taken him close to the crash site , near ufton nervet , police believe .
a first great western train travelling from london paddington to plymouth ploughed at high speed into mr drysdale 's parked silver mazda on the crossing at about 1815 gmt on saturday .
the bbc 's rachel wright said reports suggested mr drysdale 's car was on the track for quite some time before the crash , and was re-positioned shortly before the impact .
' heartbroken ' mr drysdale 's parents keith and etta , both in their 70s , said they were shocked by the accident .
their solicitor michael akehurst said : " the family have already given whatever assistance they can offer to help the official inquiries ... and are willing to provide any further help during the course of these lengthy investigations .
" they have no information on the circumstances surrounding their son 's death . "
family friend dayline vickers , 44 , said the couple were " just heartbroken " .
" etta said she had lost her son but she knew that other people have lost their loved ones as well . "
british transport police deputy chief constable andy trotter has said suicide was still being considered as a line of inquiry .
" for that driver to drive on to the crossing and leave the vehicle there , obviously it is one line of inquiry that we have had , " he said .
but he emphasised police had not closed their minds to other explanations , such as a mechanical defect in the car .
the chef left work less than an hour before the tragedy officers were looking into mr drysdale 's background , and his actions around the time of the crash , he said .
family liaison officers have been assigned to speak to those close to the chef whom , according to reports , was not married and had no children .
his sister-in-law shirley sadler told the london evening standard she could n't believe mr drysdale would willingly harm other people .
investigators have been gathering parts of the car which were scattered over 225ft -lrb- 69 metres -rrb- , while work continues to remove wrecked carriages from the site .
although his mobile phone had been found at the scene , there was no suggestion mr drysdale was using it in the minutes leading up to the smash , he added .
he confirmed there were no cctv cameras covering the scene but said this was normal practice on a quiet rural crossing .

the bill for her treatment is set to reach £ 3,500 , and it may force the farm to close .

when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor , they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people 's lives substantially .
but , says nick donofrio , senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at ibm , it was not " the thing " itself that actually improved people 's lives .
it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it .
the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities , giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs , whilst having mobility and access .
" when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century , we have to think more like this , but faster , " mr donofrio told the bbc news website , after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture .
" invention , discovery are not likely to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had .
" the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered , but by themselves , they are just not going to be able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did . "
in your face these are not altogether new ideas , and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years .
but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea , method , or device , will have to have a different kind of thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them .
we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology , argues mr donofrio , industry week 's 2003 technology leader of the year .
the hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work , make sense , make a difference and life gets better as a result . "
people will not have to do anything to stay connected .
people will know their lives are just better .
trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know " nick donofrio , ibm " in the dotcom era , there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes .
" somebody had a new thing that would awe you .
you were n't quite sure that it did anything , you were n't quite sure if you needed it , you were n't quite sure if it had value for it , but it was cool . "
but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives , he says , will come about slowly , subtlety , and in ways that will no longer be " in your face " .
it will creep in pervasively .
nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways , through new superconducting materials , to coatings , power , and memory storage .
" i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment , in an incredible network infrastructure , " says mr donofrio .
out of sight in pervasive computing , wireless rules ; jewellery , clothes , and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires , screens and keyboards .
the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there , like air .
" people will not have to do anything to stay connected .
people will know their lives are just better , " says mr donofrio .
" trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know . "
natural interfaces will develop , devices will shape your persona , and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances .
ultimately , there will be , says mr donofrio , no value in being " computer illiterate " .
to some , it sounds like a technological world gone mad .
to mr donofrio , it is a vision innovation that will happen .
behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and " deep computing " , says mr donofrio .
deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data , and integral to this concept is supercomputing .
it has value , according to ibm , because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions , such as how to refine millions of net search results , finding cures for diseases , or understanding exactly how a gene or protein operates .
diverse world but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts , commands , and requirements .
as computing and technologies become part of the environment , part of furniture , walls , and clothing , physical space becomes a more important consideration .
this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience .
" i am confident that the set -lsb- science , engineering and technology -rsb- industry is going to be short on skills , " he says .
" if i am right about what innovation is , you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative .
" women tend to have those traits a lot better than men . "
eventually , women could win out in both life and physical sciences , he says .
in the uk , a dti-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40 % representation on set industry boards .
ibm , according to mr donofrio , has 30 % .
" our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career . "
the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio .
" we believe in the whole issue of global diversity , " he says .
" our customers are diverse , our clients are diverse .
they expect us to look like them .
" as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions , it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them . "

the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities , giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs , whilst having mobility and access .
" when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century , we have to think more like this , but faster , " mr donofrio told the bbc news website , after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture .
" invention , discovery are not likely to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had .
" the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered , but by themselves , they are just not going to be able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did . "
in your face these are not altogether new ideas , and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years .
but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea , method , or device , will have to have a different kind of thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them .
we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology , argues mr donofrio , industry week 's 2003 technology leader of the year .
the hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work , make sense , make a difference and life gets better as a result .
people will not have to do anything to stay connected .
people will know their lives are just better .
trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know nick donofrio , ibm " in the dotcom era , there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes .
" somebody had a new thing that would awe you .
you were n't quite sure that it did anything , you were n't quite sure if you needed it , you were n't quite sure if it had value for it , but it was cool . "
but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives , he says , will come about slowly , subtlety , and in ways that will no longer be " in your face " .
it will creep in pervasively .
nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways , through new superconducting materials , to coatings , power , and memory storage .
" i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment , in an incredible network infrastructure , " says mr donofrio .
out of sight in pervasive computing , wireless rules ; jewellery , clothes , and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires , screens and keyboards .
the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there , like air .
" people will not have to do anything to stay connected .
people will know their lives are just better , " says mr donofrio .
millipede is a nanomechanical storage device " trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know . "
natural interfaces will develop , devices will shape your persona , and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances .
ultimately , there will be , says mr donofrio , no value in being " computer illiterate " .
to some , it sounds like a technological world gone mad .
to mr donofrio , it is a vision innovation that will happen .
behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and " deep computing " , says mr donofrio .
deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data , and integral to this concept is supercomputing .
it has value , according to ibm , because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions , such as how to refine millions of net search results , finding cures for diseases , or understanding exactly how a gene or protein operates .
diverse world but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts , commands , and requirements .
as computing and technologies become part of the environment , part of furniture , walls , and clothing , physical space becomes a more important consideration .
supercomputing will play an increasingly big part in daily lives this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience .
" i am confident that the set -lsb- science , engineering and technology -rsb- industry is going to be short on skills , " he says .
" if i am right about what innovation is , you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative .
" women tend to have those traits a lot better than men . "
eventually , women could win out in both life and physical sciences , he says .
in the uk , a dti-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40 % representation on set industry boards .
ibm , according to mr donofrio , has 30 % .
" our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career . "
the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio .
" we believe in the whole issue of global diversity , " he says .
" our customers are diverse , our clients are diverse .
they expect us to look like them .
" as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions , it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them . "

your jewellery could be doing the talking for you when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor , they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people 's lives substantially .
but , says nick donofrio , senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at ibm , it was not " the thing " itself that actually improved people 's lives .
it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it .
the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities , giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs , whilst having mobility and access .
" when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century , we have to think more like this , but faster , " mr donofrio told the bbc news website , after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture .
" invention , discovery are not likely to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had .
" the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered , but by themselves , they are just not going to be able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did . "
in your face these are not altogether new ideas , and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years .
but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea , method , or device , will have to have a different kind of thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them .
we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology , argues mr donofrio , industry week 's 2003 technology leader of the year .
the hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work , make sense , make a difference and life gets better as a result .
people will not have to do anything to stay connected .
people will know their lives are just better .
trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know nick donofrio , ibm " in the dotcom era , there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes .
" somebody had a new thing that would awe you .
you were n't quite sure that it did anything , you were n't quite sure if you needed it , you were n't quite sure if it had value for it , but it was cool . "
but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives , he says , will come about slowly , subtlety , and in ways that will no longer be " in your face " .
it will creep in pervasively .
nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways , through new superconducting materials , to coatings , power , and memory storage .
" i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment , in an incredible network infrastructure , " says mr donofrio .
out of sight in pervasive computing , wireless rules ; jewellery , clothes , and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires , screens and keyboards .
the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there , like air .
" people will not have to do anything to stay connected .
people will know their lives are just better , " says mr donofrio .
millipede is a nanomechanical storage device " trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know . "
natural interfaces will develop , devices will shape your persona , and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances .
ultimately , there will be , says mr donofrio , no value in being " computer illiterate " .
to some , it sounds like a technological world gone mad .
to mr donofrio , it is a vision innovation that will happen .
behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and " deep computing " , says mr donofrio .
deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data , and integral to this concept is supercomputing .
it has value , according to ibm , because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions , such as how to refine millions of net search results , finding cures for diseases , or understanding exactly how a gene or protein operates .
diverse world but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts , commands , and requirements .
as computing and technologies become part of the environment , part of furniture , walls , and clothing , physical space becomes a more important consideration .
supercomputing will play an increasingly big part in daily lives this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience .
" i am confident that the set -lsb- science , engineering and technology -rsb- industry is going to be short on skills , " he says .
" if i am right about what innovation is , you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative .
" women tend to have those traits a lot better than men . "
eventually , women could win out in both life and physical sciences , he says .
in the uk , a dti-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40 % representation on set industry boards .
ibm , according to mr donofrio , has 30 % .
" our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career . "
the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio .

nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways , through new superconducting materials , to coatings , power , and memory storage .
" i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment , in an incredible network infrastructure , " says mr donofrio .
out of sight in pervasive computing , wireless rules ; jewellery , clothes , and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires , screens and keyboards .
the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there , like air .
" people will not have to do anything to stay connected .
people will know their lives are just better , " says mr donofrio .
millipede is a nanomechanical storage device " trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know . "
natural interfaces will develop , devices will shape your persona , and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances .
ultimately , there will be , says mr donofrio , no value in being " computer illiterate " .
to some , it sounds like a technological world gone mad .
to mr donofrio , it is a vision innovation that will happen .
behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and " deep computing " , says mr donofrio .
deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data , and integral to this concept is supercomputing .
it has value , according to ibm , because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions , such as how to refine millions of net search results , finding cures for diseases , or understanding exactly how a gene or protein operates .
diverse world but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts , commands , and requirements .
as computing and technologies become part of the environment , part of furniture , walls , and clothing , physical space becomes a more important consideration .
supercomputing will play an increasingly big part in daily lives this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience .
" i am confident that the set -lsb- science , engineering and technology -rsb- industry is going to be short on skills , " he says .
" if i am right about what innovation is , you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative .
" women tend to have those traits a lot better than men . "
eventually , women could win out in both life and physical sciences , he says .
in the uk , a dti-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40 % representation on set industry boards .
ibm , according to mr donofrio , has 30 % .
" our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career . "
the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio .
" we believe in the whole issue of global diversity , " he says .
" our customers are diverse , our clients are diverse .
they expect us to look like them .
" as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions , it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them . "

the celebrities are raising money for autism cymru , wales ' national charity for autism .
the 2005 calendar , together with an exhibition , is being launched in cardiff on wednesday .
tv presenters amanda protheroe thomas , iolo williams , rhodri ogwen and former rugby star ray gravell also took part .
and plaid politician rhodri glyn thomas , dj zoe hanson and miss wales amy guy are among those who have all got in on the act too .
autism cymru was set up in 2001 to help people with autism , which is a developmental disability affecting social skills .
autistic spectrum disorders are estimated to affect around 18,000 children and adults in wales .
derek brockway , more often spotted in front of a weather map , said he was always happy to support a charity .
