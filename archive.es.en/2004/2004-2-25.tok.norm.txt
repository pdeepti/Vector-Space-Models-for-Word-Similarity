during a u.s. visit to discuss the use of biometric technology in the war against terror , german interior minister otto schily denied that his country knowingly passed on information on a sep.11 hijacker to the cia . known for his tough , no-nonsense manner , schily enjoys a good reputation in washington : some political observers even believe that schily is one of the most-liked german politicians in the white house .

11 hijacker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just tough talking - schily -lrb- right -rrb- with u.s. homeland security chief tom ridge .
during a u.s. visit to discuss the use of biometric technology in the war against terror , german interior minister otto schily denied that his country knowingly passed on information on a sep.11 hijacker to the cia . known for his tough , no-nonsense manner , schily enjoys a good reputation in washington : some political observers even believe that schily is one of the most-liked german politicians in the white house .
sure enough , there was enough evidence of that goodwill during the minister 's five-day visit to the u.s. dominated by security issues .
schily met for wide-ranging talks with america 's who 's-who of security and intelligence - u.s. attorney general john ashcroft , homeland security chief tom ridge , national security advisor condoleeza rice , cia chief george tenet and fbi head robert mueller . biometrics to the fore the discussions centered on the implementation of biometric technology to enhance existing security measures particularly when screening passengers entering the country .
at a meeting last october in berlin , both schily and ridge had attributed a " leading role " to the eu and the u.s. in the introduction of biometric data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily uses the iris scan machine at frankfurt airport starting this year the u.s. introduced finger-printing and digital photos for passengers entering the country with a visa .
the data is stored in a computer and can be compared with a terrorist and criminal database .
schily also kicked off a six-month pilot iris-scan project at the frankfurt airport this month -lrb- photo -rrb- . u.s.-imposed deadline a sore point but the main sticking point on the biometrics issue is an oct .
26 deadline that the u.s. has set for germany and 27 other countries - whose citizens do not require a visa to the u.s. for a stay of up to 90 days - to issue biometric passports that would include a microchip containing electronic facial features or fingerprinting data . though schily made clear at a press conference on monday that , " the commitment of this date is no way thrown into question , " experts believe that most eu countries will fail to meet the deadline .
it 's not just the massive technical and logistics effort that is expected to hinder eu states in sticking to the given date , but also a lack of common standards on the introduction of biometric data , both within the eu as well as with the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric passport it still remains unclear which data -lrb- fingerprints , iris scans , facial recognition -rrb- and what storage technology will be used in the process .
though schily has warned that disparate regulations would complicate controls and disrupt air travel , he was vague on monday about whether he discussed the issue with the americans .
" yes , well , we have to see whether we can really do that -lrb- achieve common standards -rrb- , " he said . schily : " article is misleading " schily however was much more unequivocal that germans had " no idea " that a man whose first name and telephone number they passed on to u.s. authorities long before the sep.11 terrorist attacks would turn out to be a key player in the plot . the new york times reported earlier tuesday that german intelligence officials gave the cia the above information on marwan al-shehhi in march 1999 and asked the americans to track him .
the story , citing a senior german intelligence official , said that after the germans passed on the information to the cia , they did not hear form the americans about the matter until after sep .

the global trend in exporting jobs to low-income countries like india has created a niche for institutes teaching indian workers how to dress , talk and eat like their western bosses . when mohan verma , an indian systems analyst , heads to london to work on a deutsche bank project , the butterflies in his stomach will be more than just the excitement of his first trip away from his home country .
the 28-year-old techie will be at pains to eat , dress and talk just like the english do .
the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .
lessons in western ways in demand in the past two years , dozens of such institutes have been popping up in big indian cities like bangalore , hyderabad and pune .
the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .
that includes telling them about the western way of life , the geographic and demographic details of the various states they have to call and making them watch hollywood films and tapes with dialogue in american or canadian accents , " said soorej sachindran , who speaks with a perfect american accent despite never having been to the u.s. the team manager at manipal informatics , which does call center work for american and canadian companies , requires his employees learn american and canadian slang , something that comes in handy when trying to understand angry customers at the other end of the line .
" telemarkting means listening … and we have to tell our employees that the expletives and ' no 's ' are not directed against them , " he said .
germany on the outsourcing bandwagon the booming manners and language sector has yet to realize its full potential , as more and more companies shift operations to india .
german companies , especially , are pushing the trend .
all of lufthansa 's global reservations and inquiries are handled from india , and deutsche bank , siemens and daimlerchrysler have also outsourced international call center operations .
experts nevertheless think the outsourcing between germany and india has more room to grow .
" it 's a win-win situation for german companies .
india promises lower overhead costs , " said ketan shukla , the commerce attaché at the indian embassy in berlin .
on a recent visit to germany a high-powered indian it delegation lead by n.r. narayanmurthy , chairman of infosys , one of india 's biggest software groups , said that between 10,000 and 30,000 employees should be trained in german in the next two years .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .
trittin has announced that germany will stick to the deadline , ensuring further negotiations between the industry leaders and the greens to find a compromise . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions trading plan riles industry as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .
trittin has announced that germany will stick to the deadline , ensuring further negotiations between the industry leaders and the greens to find a compromise . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions trading plan riles industry as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .

that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .

for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .

" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.02.2004 germans debate introducing national minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leader frank bsirske promotes the idea .
germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .

bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .
in france , the national minimum wage dates back to 1950 .
the system was revamped in the 1970s , and now has between 30 and 40 percent of the nation 's workforce , known as smicards , on its books .
they earn a monthly wage of € 1,215 and are well-respected members of society .
despite this achievement , the system appears not to have served as a lasting cure for unemployment in the republic . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france slashes unemployment benefits french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .

five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment . the operators of germany 's nuclear 18 power plants insist there is no need to re-open negotiations with the government on the closure of their facilities , according to german daily der tagesspiegel .
but some see things differently , including heide moser , the health and consumer protection minister for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
she has urged federal environment minister jürgen trittin to invite the power station operators to join him in a fresh round of talks .

the energy spokesperson for the greens , michaele hustedt , said the government 's present catalogue of measures was " better than nothing " , but still " inadequate . "
she backed calls for fresh talks between the government and the operators on early closure saying the power produced by the older reactors could be taken from newer reactors instead .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .

" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

the biblis nuclear power plant in hesse .
five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment . the operators of germany 's nuclear 18 power plants insist there is no need to re-open negotiations with the government on the closure of their facilities , according to german daily der tagesspiegel .
but some see things differently , including heide moser , the health and consumer protection minister for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
she has urged federal environment minister jürgen trittin to invite the power station operators to join him in a fresh round of talks .
" it would be a good idea for the federal environment minister to hold talks on shutting down individual reactors earlier than planned , " she told the paper .

" better than nothing " but still " inadequate " the operators said they have agreed a " catalogue of measures " with the government which covered all the relevant security precautions .

the energy spokesperson for the greens , michaele hustedt , said the government 's present catalogue of measures was " better than nothing " , but still " inadequate . "
she backed calls for fresh talks between the government and the operators on early closure saying the power produced by the older reactors could be taken from newer reactors instead .

nuclear power is an emotionally-charged topic in germany : the transport of spent nuclear fuel attracts regular public protest and the greens ' party , the junior partners in chancellor schröder ' centre-left coalition , grew out of the anti-nuclear protest movement of the 1970s and 80s . dw staff -lrb- mc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agency : five german nuclear plants vulnerable to attacks the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks .

11 hijacker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just tough talking - schily -lrb- right -rrb- with u.s. homeland security chief tom ridge .
during a u.s. visit to discuss the use of biometric technology in the war against terror , german interior minister otto schily denied that his country knowingly passed on information on a sep.11 hijacker to the cia . known for his tough , no-nonsense manner , schily enjoys a good reputation in washington : some political observers even believe that schily is one of the most-liked german politicians in the white house .
sure enough , there was enough evidence of that goodwill during the minister 's five-day visit to the u.s. dominated by security issues .
schily met for wide-ranging talks with america 's who 's-who of security and intelligence - u.s. attorney general john ashcroft , homeland security chief tom ridge , national security advisor condoleeza rice , cia chief george tenet and fbi head robert mueller . biometrics to the fore the discussions centered on the implementation of biometric technology to enhance existing security measures particularly when screening passengers entering the country .
at a meeting last october in berlin , both schily and ridge had attributed a " leading role " to the eu and the u.s. in the introduction of biometric data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily uses the iris scan machine at frankfurt airport starting this year the u.s. introduced finger-printing and digital photos for passengers entering the country with a visa .
the data is stored in a computer and can be compared with a terrorist and criminal database .
schily also kicked off a six-month pilot iris-scan project at the frankfurt airport this month -lrb- photo -rrb- . u.s.-imposed deadline a sore point but the main sticking point on the biometrics issue is an oct .
26 deadline that the u.s. has set for germany and 27 other countries - whose citizens do not require a visa to the u.s. for a stay of up to 90 days - to issue biometric passports that would include a microchip containing electronic facial features or fingerprinting data . though schily made clear at a press conference on monday that , " the commitment of this date is no way thrown into question , " experts believe that most eu countries will fail to meet the deadline .
it 's not just the massive technical and logistics effort that is expected to hinder eu states in sticking to the given date , but also a lack of common standards on the introduction of biometric data , both within the eu as well as with the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric passport it still remains unclear which data -lrb- fingerprints , iris scans , facial recognition -rrb- and what storage technology will be used in the process .
though schily has warned that disparate regulations would complicate controls and disrupt air travel , he was vague on monday about whether he discussed the issue with the americans .
" yes , well , we have to see whether we can really do that -lrb- achieve common standards -rrb- , " he said . schily : " article is misleading " schily however was much more unequivocal that germans had " no idea " that a man whose first name and telephone number they passed on to u.s. authorities long before the sep.11 terrorist attacks would turn out to be a key player in the plot . the new york times reported earlier tuesday that german intelligence officials gave the cia the above information on marwan al-shehhi in march 1999 and asked the americans to track him .
the story , citing a senior german intelligence official , said that after the germans passed on the information to the cia , they did not hear form the americans about the matter until after sep .
11 . " your article was a little bit misleading , " schily told a small group of reporters including one of the authors of the new york times article , reuters reported . the information was the earliest known clue the u.s. received about any of the hijackers and has now become a crucial element of an independent u.s. commission 's investigation into sep .
11 , 2001 .
u.s. officials say al-shehhi was the pilot who flew the second plane into the world trade center . a united arab emirates native , al-shehhi moved to germany in 1996 and became a key member of the al qaeda hamburg cell at the heart of the sept .
11 plot .
mohammed atta , one of the plot leaders , was his roommate . " routine " data exchange schily added that the indication that german intelligence officials had made a link between the name and an upcoming attack " is not true .
at that time we had no idea that -lrb- it -rrb- could be a thing like this -lrb- the sept .
11 attacks -rrb- . "
the minister said that germany gave the information on al-shehhi to the u.s. as part of " routine " data exchanges , adding that authorities were unable to connect the rather common arabic name " marwan " to a family name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cia director george tenet cia director george tennet -lrb- photo -rrb- also rejected suggestions that his agency had failed to act on the german tip .
speaking before an annual senate intelligence committee hearing on global threats on tuesday , tenet said , " in 1999 the germans gave us a name - marwan , that 's it , and a phone number .
and we did n't sit on our hands . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de look me in the eye forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.02.2004 germans debate introducing national minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leader frank bsirske promotes the idea .
germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .
in france , the national minimum wage dates back to 1950 .
the system was revamped in the 1970s , and now has between 30 and 40 percent of the nation 's workforce , known as smicards , on its books .
they earn a monthly wage of € 1,215 and are well-respected members of society .
despite this achievement , the system appears not to have served as a lasting cure for unemployment in the republic . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france slashes unemployment benefits french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .

the global trend in exporting jobs to low-income countries like india has created a niche for institutes teaching indian workers how to dress , talk and eat like their western bosses . when mohan verma , an indian systems analyst , heads to london to work on a deutsche bank project , the butterflies in his stomach will be more than just the excitement of his first trip away from his home country .
the 28-year-old techie will be at pains to eat , dress and talk just like the english do .
the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .
lessons in western ways in demand in the past two years , dozens of such institutes have been popping up in big indian cities like bangalore , hyderabad and pune .
the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .
that includes telling them about the western way of life , the geographic and demographic details of the various states they have to call and making them watch hollywood films and tapes with dialogue in american or canadian accents , " said soorej sachindran , who speaks with a perfect american accent despite never having been to the u.s. the team manager at manipal informatics , which does call center work for american and canadian companies , requires his employees learn american and canadian slang , something that comes in handy when trying to understand angry customers at the other end of the line .
" telemarkting means listening … and we have to tell our employees that the expletives and ' no 's ' are not directed against them , " he said .
germany on the outsourcing bandwagon the booming manners and language sector has yet to realize its full potential , as more and more companies shift operations to india .
german companies , especially , are pushing the trend .
all of lufthansa 's global reservations and inquiries are handled from india , and deutsche bank , siemens and daimlerchrysler have also outsourced international call center operations .
experts nevertheless think the outsourcing between germany and india has more room to grow .
" it 's a win-win situation for german companies .
india promises lower overhead costs , " said ketan shukla , the commerce attaché at the indian embassy in berlin .
on a recent visit to germany a high-powered indian it delegation lead by n.r. narayanmurthy , chairman of infosys , one of india 's biggest software groups , said that between 10,000 and 30,000 employees should be trained in german in the next two years .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .
in france , the national minimum wage dates back to 1950 .
the system was revamped in the 1970s , and now has between 30 and 40 percent of the nation 's workforce , known as smicards , on its books .
they earn a monthly wage of € 1,215 and are well-respected members of society .

11 hijacker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just tough talking - schily -lrb- right -rrb- with u.s. homeland security chief tom ridge .
during a u.s. visit to discuss the use of biometric technology in the war against terror , german interior minister otto schily denied that his country knowingly passed on information on a sep.11 hijacker to the cia . known for his tough , no-nonsense manner , schily enjoys a good reputation in washington : some political observers even believe that schily is one of the most-liked german politicians in the white house .
sure enough , there was enough evidence of that goodwill during the minister 's five-day visit to the u.s. dominated by security issues .
schily met for wide-ranging talks with america 's who 's-who of security and intelligence - u.s. attorney general john ashcroft , homeland security chief tom ridge , national security advisor condoleeza rice , cia chief george tenet and fbi head robert mueller . biometrics to the fore the discussions centered on the implementation of biometric technology to enhance existing security measures particularly when screening passengers entering the country .
at a meeting last october in berlin , both schily and ridge had attributed a " leading role " to the eu and the u.s. in the introduction of biometric data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily uses the iris scan machine at frankfurt airport starting this year the u.s. introduced finger-printing and digital photos for passengers entering the country with a visa .

though schily has warned that disparate regulations would complicate controls and disrupt air travel , he was vague on monday about whether he discussed the issue with the americans .
" yes , well , we have to see whether we can really do that -lrb- achieve common standards -rrb- , " he said . schily : " article is misleading " schily however was much more unequivocal that germans had " no idea " that a man whose first name and telephone number they passed on to u.s. authorities long before the sep.11 terrorist attacks would turn out to be a key player in the plot . the new york times reported earlier tuesday that german intelligence officials gave the cia the above information on marwan al-shehhi in march 1999 and asked the americans to track him .
the story , citing a senior german intelligence official , said that after the germans passed on the information to the cia , they did not hear form the americans about the matter until after sep .

during a u.s. visit to discuss the use of biometric technology in the war against terror , german interior minister otto schily denied that his country knowingly passed on information on a sep.11 hijacker to the cia . known for his tough , no-nonsense manner , schily enjoys a good reputation in washington : some political observers even believe that schily is one of the most-liked german politicians in the white house .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn , center , raises the trophy in front of the team , after winning the18th german soccer championship , after the bundesliga match bayern munich vs. stuttgart may 17 , 2003 .
" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

the global trend in exporting jobs to low-income countries like india has created a niche for institutes teaching indian workers how to dress , talk and eat like their western bosses . when mohan verma , an indian systems analyst , heads to london to work on a deutsche bank project , the butterflies in his stomach will be more than just the excitement of his first trip away from his home country .
the 28-year-old techie will be at pains to eat , dress and talk just like the english do .
the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .
lessons in western ways in demand in the past two years , dozens of such institutes have been popping up in big indian cities like bangalore , hyderabad and pune .
the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .
that includes telling them about the western way of life , the geographic and demographic details of the various states they have to call and making them watch hollywood films and tapes with dialogue in american or canadian accents , " said soorej sachindran , who speaks with a perfect american accent despite never having been to the u.s. the team manager at manipal informatics , which does call center work for american and canadian companies , requires his employees learn american and canadian slang , something that comes in handy when trying to understand angry customers at the other end of the line .
" telemarkting means listening … and we have to tell our employees that the expletives and ' no 's ' are not directed against them , " he said .
germany on the outsourcing bandwagon the booming manners and language sector has yet to realize its full potential , as more and more companies shift operations to india .
german companies , especially , are pushing the trend .
all of lufthansa 's global reservations and inquiries are handled from india , and deutsche bank , siemens and daimlerchrysler have also outsourced international call center operations .
experts nevertheless think the outsourcing between germany and india has more room to grow .
" it 's a win-win situation for german companies .
india promises lower overhead costs , " said ketan shukla , the commerce attaché at the indian embassy in berlin .
on a recent visit to germany a high-powered indian it delegation lead by n.r. narayanmurthy , chairman of infosys , one of india 's biggest software groups , said that between 10,000 and 30,000 employees should be trained in german in the next two years .
verma is already ahead of the game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.02.2004 german industry and greens at loggerheads over emissions plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many credits are going up in smoke ?
german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .
trittin has announced that germany will stick to the deadline , ensuring further negotiations between the industry leaders and the greens to find a compromise . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions trading plan riles industry as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn , center , raises the trophy in front of the team , after winning the18th german soccer championship , after the bundesliga match bayern munich vs. stuttgart may 17 , 2003 .
" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn , center , raises the trophy in front of the team , after winning the18th german soccer championship , after the bundesliga match bayern munich vs. stuttgart may 17 , 2003 .
" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

the biblis nuclear power plant in hesse .
five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment . the operators of germany 's nuclear 18 power plants insist there is no need to re-open negotiations with the government on the closure of their facilities , according to german daily der tagesspiegel .
but some see things differently , including heide moser , the health and consumer protection minister for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
she has urged federal environment minister jürgen trittin to invite the power station operators to join him in a fresh round of talks .
" it would be a good idea for the federal environment minister to hold talks on shutting down individual reactors earlier than planned , " she told the paper .
schleswig-holstein is home to the brunsbüttel reactor , one of the five the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- wants to see closed down .
the other reactors are in the federal states of baden-württemberg -lrb- philippsburg 1 and obrigheim -rrb- , bavaria -lrb- isar 1 -rrb- and hesse -lrb- biblis 1 -rrb- .
the agency says these reactors are older models and have insufficient safeguards against a sept .
11-style terror attack in which a passenger plane would be crashed into a nuclear plant .
" better than nothing " but still " inadequate " the operators said they have agreed a " catalogue of measures " with the government which covered all the relevant security precautions .
environment minister jürgen trittin was therefore well aware of their plans to protect nuclear power plants from terror attacks , they said .
the energy spokesperson for the greens , michaele hustedt , said the government 's present catalogue of measures was " better than nothing " , but still " inadequate . "
she backed calls for fresh talks between the government and the operators on early closure saying the power produced by the older reactors could be taken from newer reactors instead .
nuclear power to be phased out in 20 years the government says there is no need to panic .
horst kubatschaka , the social democrat parliamentarian with special responsibility for nuclear power , criticized the bfs for going public with its findings .
" it would have been better if they had spoken to us first , " he told der tagesspiegel .
germany is planning to phase out nuclear power over the next 20 years , irrespective of any measures to cope with the threat of terror .
nuclear power is an emotionally-charged topic in germany : the transport of spent nuclear fuel attracts regular public protest and the greens ' party , the junior partners in chancellor schröder ' centre-left coalition , grew out of the anti-nuclear protest movement of the 1970s and 80s . dw staff -lrb- mc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agency : five german nuclear plants vulnerable to attacks the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks .

the biblis nuclear power plant in hesse .
five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment . the operators of germany 's nuclear 18 power plants insist there is no need to re-open negotiations with the government on the closure of their facilities , according to german daily der tagesspiegel .
but some see things differently , including heide moser , the health and consumer protection minister for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
she has urged federal environment minister jürgen trittin to invite the power station operators to join him in a fresh round of talks .
" it would be a good idea for the federal environment minister to hold talks on shutting down individual reactors earlier than planned , " she told the paper .
schleswig-holstein is home to the brunsbüttel reactor , one of the five the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- wants to see closed down .
the other reactors are in the federal states of baden-württemberg -lrb- philippsburg 1 and obrigheim -rrb- , bavaria -lrb- isar 1 -rrb- and hesse -lrb- biblis 1 -rrb- .
the agency says these reactors are older models and have insufficient safeguards against a sept .
11-style terror attack in which a passenger plane would be crashed into a nuclear plant .
" better than nothing " but still " inadequate " the operators said they have agreed a " catalogue of measures " with the government which covered all the relevant security precautions .
environment minister jürgen trittin was therefore well aware of their plans to protect nuclear power plants from terror attacks , they said .
the energy spokesperson for the greens , michaele hustedt , said the government 's present catalogue of measures was " better than nothing " , but still " inadequate . "
she backed calls for fresh talks between the government and the operators on early closure saying the power produced by the older reactors could be taken from newer reactors instead .
nuclear power to be phased out in 20 years the government says there is no need to panic .
horst kubatschaka , the social democrat parliamentarian with special responsibility for nuclear power , criticized the bfs for going public with its findings .
" it would have been better if they had spoken to us first , " he told der tagesspiegel .
germany is planning to phase out nuclear power over the next 20 years , irrespective of any measures to cope with the threat of terror .
nuclear power is an emotionally-charged topic in germany : the transport of spent nuclear fuel attracts regular public protest and the greens ' party , the junior partners in chancellor schröder ' centre-left coalition , grew out of the anti-nuclear protest movement of the 1970s and 80s . dw staff -lrb- mc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agency : five german nuclear plants vulnerable to attacks the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks .

11 hijacker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just tough talking - schily -lrb- right -rrb- with u.s. homeland security chief tom ridge .
during a u.s. visit to discuss the use of biometric technology in the war against terror , german interior minister otto schily denied that his country knowingly passed on information on a sep.11 hijacker to the cia . known for his tough , no-nonsense manner , schily enjoys a good reputation in washington : some political observers even believe that schily is one of the most-liked german politicians in the white house .
sure enough , there was enough evidence of that goodwill during the minister 's five-day visit to the u.s. dominated by security issues .
schily met for wide-ranging talks with america 's who 's-who of security and intelligence - u.s. attorney general john ashcroft , homeland security chief tom ridge , national security advisor condoleeza rice , cia chief george tenet and fbi head robert mueller . biometrics to the fore the discussions centered on the implementation of biometric technology to enhance existing security measures particularly when screening passengers entering the country .
at a meeting last october in berlin , both schily and ridge had attributed a " leading role " to the eu and the u.s. in the introduction of biometric data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily uses the iris scan machine at frankfurt airport starting this year the u.s. introduced finger-printing and digital photos for passengers entering the country with a visa .
the data is stored in a computer and can be compared with a terrorist and criminal database .

26 deadline that the u.s. has set for germany and 27 other countries - whose citizens do not require a visa to the u.s. for a stay of up to 90 days - to issue biometric passports that would include a microchip containing electronic facial features or fingerprinting data . though schily made clear at a press conference on monday that , " the commitment of this date is no way thrown into question , " experts believe that most eu countries will fail to meet the deadline .
it 's not just the massive technical and logistics effort that is expected to hinder eu states in sticking to the given date , but also a lack of common standards on the introduction of biometric data , both within the eu as well as with the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric passport it still remains unclear which data -lrb- fingerprints , iris scans , facial recognition -rrb- and what storage technology will be used in the process .
though schily has warned that disparate regulations would complicate controls and disrupt air travel , he was vague on monday about whether he discussed the issue with the americans .
" yes , well , we have to see whether we can really do that -lrb- achieve common standards -rrb- , " he said . schily : " article is misleading " schily however was much more unequivocal that germans had " no idea " that a man whose first name and telephone number they passed on to u.s. authorities long before the sep.11 terrorist attacks would turn out to be a key player in the plot . the new york times reported earlier tuesday that german intelligence officials gave the cia the above information on marwan al-shehhi in march 1999 and asked the americans to track him .
the story , citing a senior german intelligence official , said that after the germans passed on the information to the cia , they did not hear form the americans about the matter until after sep .

" your article was a little bit misleading , " schily told a small group of reporters including one of the authors of the new york times article , reuters reported . the information was the earliest known clue the u.s. received about any of the hijackers and has now become a crucial element of an independent u.s. commission 's investigation into sep .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .

" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.02.2004 soccer stars versus solid team investment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : number 23 david beckham is real madrid 's ticket to success .
tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn , center , raises the trophy in front of the team , after winning the18th german soccer championship , after the bundesliga match bayern munich vs. stuttgart may 17 , 2003 .
" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

the global trend in exporting jobs to low-income countries like india has created a niche for institutes teaching indian workers how to dress , talk and eat like their western bosses . when mohan verma , an indian systems analyst , heads to london to work on a deutsche bank project , the butterflies in his stomach will be more than just the excitement of his first trip away from his home country .
the 28-year-old techie will be at pains to eat , dress and talk just like the english do .
the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .

the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .
that includes telling them about the western way of life , the geographic and demographic details of the various states they have to call and making them watch hollywood films and tapes with dialogue in american or canadian accents , " said soorej sachindran , who speaks with a perfect american accent despite never having been to the u.s. the team manager at manipal informatics , which does call center work for american and canadian companies , requires his employees learn american and canadian slang , something that comes in handy when trying to understand angry customers at the other end of the line .
" telemarkting means listening … and we have to tell our employees that the expletives and ' no 's ' are not directed against them , " he said .
germany on the outsourcing bandwagon the booming manners and language sector has yet to realize its full potential , as more and more companies shift operations to india .
german companies , especially , are pushing the trend .
all of lufthansa 's global reservations and inquiries are handled from india , and deutsche bank , siemens and daimlerchrysler have also outsourced international call center operations .

the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .
lessons in western ways in demand in the past two years , dozens of such institutes have been popping up in big indian cities like bangalore , hyderabad and pune .
the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .
that includes telling them about the western way of life , the geographic and demographic details of the various states they have to call and making them watch hollywood films and tapes with dialogue in american or canadian accents , " said soorej sachindran , who speaks with a perfect american accent despite never having been to the u.s. the team manager at manipal informatics , which does call center work for american and canadian companies , requires his employees learn american and canadian slang , something that comes in handy when trying to understand angry customers at the other end of the line .
" telemarkting means listening … and we have to tell our employees that the expletives and ' no 's ' are not directed against them , " he said .
germany on the outsourcing bandwagon the booming manners and language sector has yet to realize its full potential , as more and more companies shift operations to india .
german companies , especially , are pushing the trend .
all of lufthansa 's global reservations and inquiries are handled from india , and deutsche bank , siemens and daimlerchrysler have also outsourced international call center operations .
experts nevertheless think the outsourcing between germany and india has more room to grow .
" it 's a win-win situation for german companies .
india promises lower overhead costs , " said ketan shukla , the commerce attaché at the indian embassy in berlin .
on a recent visit to germany a high-powered indian it delegation lead by n.r. narayanmurthy , chairman of infosys , one of india 's biggest software groups , said that between 10,000 and 30,000 employees should be trained in german in the next two years .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .
trittin has announced that germany will stick to the deadline , ensuring further negotiations between the industry leaders and the greens to find a compromise . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions trading plan riles industry as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn , center , raises the trophy in front of the team , after winning the18th german soccer championship , after the bundesliga match bayern munich vs. stuttgart may 17 , 2003 .
" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

during a u.s. visit to discuss the use of biometric technology in the war against terror , german interior minister otto schily denied that his country knowingly passed on information on a sep.11 hijacker to the cia . known for his tough , no-nonsense manner , schily enjoys a good reputation in washington : some political observers even believe that schily is one of the most-liked german politicians in the white house .

11 hijacker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just tough talking - schily -lrb- right -rrb- with u.s. homeland security chief tom ridge .
during a u.s. visit to discuss the use of biometric technology in the war against terror , german interior minister otto schily denied that his country knowingly passed on information on a sep.11 hijacker to the cia . known for his tough , no-nonsense manner , schily enjoys a good reputation in washington : some political observers even believe that schily is one of the most-liked german politicians in the white house .
sure enough , there was enough evidence of that goodwill during the minister 's five-day visit to the u.s. dominated by security issues .
schily met for wide-ranging talks with america 's who 's-who of security and intelligence - u.s. attorney general john ashcroft , homeland security chief tom ridge , national security advisor condoleeza rice , cia chief george tenet and fbi head robert mueller . biometrics to the fore the discussions centered on the implementation of biometric technology to enhance existing security measures particularly when screening passengers entering the country .
at a meeting last october in berlin , both schily and ridge had attributed a " leading role " to the eu and the u.s. in the introduction of biometric data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily uses the iris scan machine at frankfurt airport starting this year the u.s. introduced finger-printing and digital photos for passengers entering the country with a visa .
the data is stored in a computer and can be compared with a terrorist and criminal database .
schily also kicked off a six-month pilot iris-scan project at the frankfurt airport this month -lrb- photo -rrb- . u.s.-imposed deadline a sore point but the main sticking point on the biometrics issue is an oct .
26 deadline that the u.s. has set for germany and 27 other countries - whose citizens do not require a visa to the u.s. for a stay of up to 90 days - to issue biometric passports that would include a microchip containing electronic facial features or fingerprinting data . though schily made clear at a press conference on monday that , " the commitment of this date is no way thrown into question , " experts believe that most eu countries will fail to meet the deadline .
it 's not just the massive technical and logistics effort that is expected to hinder eu states in sticking to the given date , but also a lack of common standards on the introduction of biometric data , both within the eu as well as with the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric passport it still remains unclear which data -lrb- fingerprints , iris scans , facial recognition -rrb- and what storage technology will be used in the process .
though schily has warned that disparate regulations would complicate controls and disrupt air travel , he was vague on monday about whether he discussed the issue with the americans .
" yes , well , we have to see whether we can really do that -lrb- achieve common standards -rrb- , " he said . schily : " article is misleading " schily however was much more unequivocal that germans had " no idea " that a man whose first name and telephone number they passed on to u.s. authorities long before the sep.11 terrorist attacks would turn out to be a key player in the plot . the new york times reported earlier tuesday that german intelligence officials gave the cia the above information on marwan al-shehhi in march 1999 and asked the americans to track him .
the story , citing a senior german intelligence official , said that after the germans passed on the information to the cia , they did not hear form the americans about the matter until after sep .
11 . " your article was a little bit misleading , " schily told a small group of reporters including one of the authors of the new york times article , reuters reported . the information was the earliest known clue the u.s. received about any of the hijackers and has now become a crucial element of an independent u.s. commission 's investigation into sep .

the biblis nuclear power plant in hesse .
five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment . the operators of germany 's nuclear 18 power plants insist there is no need to re-open negotiations with the government on the closure of their facilities , according to german daily der tagesspiegel .
but some see things differently , including heide moser , the health and consumer protection minister for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
she has urged federal environment minister jürgen trittin to invite the power station operators to join him in a fresh round of talks .

the energy spokesperson for the greens , michaele hustedt , said the government 's present catalogue of measures was " better than nothing " , but still " inadequate . "
she backed calls for fresh talks between the government and the operators on early closure saying the power produced by the older reactors could be taken from newer reactors instead .

the biblis nuclear power plant in hesse .
five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment . the operators of germany 's nuclear 18 power plants insist there is no need to re-open negotiations with the government on the closure of their facilities , according to german daily der tagesspiegel .
but some see things differently , including heide moser , the health and consumer protection minister for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
she has urged federal environment minister jürgen trittin to invite the power station operators to join him in a fresh round of talks .
" it would be a good idea for the federal environment minister to hold talks on shutting down individual reactors earlier than planned , " she told the paper .
schleswig-holstein is home to the brunsbüttel reactor , one of the five the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- wants to see closed down .
the other reactors are in the federal states of baden-württemberg -lrb- philippsburg 1 and obrigheim -rrb- , bavaria -lrb- isar 1 -rrb- and hesse -lrb- biblis 1 -rrb- .
the agency says these reactors are older models and have insufficient safeguards against a sept .
11-style terror attack in which a passenger plane would be crashed into a nuclear plant .
" better than nothing " but still " inadequate " the operators said they have agreed a " catalogue of measures " with the government which covered all the relevant security precautions .
environment minister jürgen trittin was therefore well aware of their plans to protect nuclear power plants from terror attacks , they said .
the energy spokesperson for the greens , michaele hustedt , said the government 's present catalogue of measures was " better than nothing " , but still " inadequate . "
she backed calls for fresh talks between the government and the operators on early closure saying the power produced by the older reactors could be taken from newer reactors instead .
nuclear power to be phased out in 20 years the government says there is no need to panic .
horst kubatschaka , the social democrat parliamentarian with special responsibility for nuclear power , criticized the bfs for going public with its findings .
" it would have been better if they had spoken to us first , " he told der tagesspiegel .
germany is planning to phase out nuclear power over the next 20 years , irrespective of any measures to cope with the threat of terror .
nuclear power is an emotionally-charged topic in germany : the transport of spent nuclear fuel attracts regular public protest and the greens ' party , the junior partners in chancellor schröder ' centre-left coalition , grew out of the anti-nuclear protest movement of the 1970s and 80s . dw staff -lrb- mc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agency : five german nuclear plants vulnerable to attacks the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn , center , raises the trophy in front of the team , after winning the18th german soccer championship , after the bundesliga match bayern munich vs. stuttgart may 17 , 2003 .
" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .

" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .

the global trend in exporting jobs to low-income countries like india has created a niche for institutes teaching indian workers how to dress , talk and eat like their western bosses . when mohan verma , an indian systems analyst , heads to london to work on a deutsche bank project , the butterflies in his stomach will be more than just the excitement of his first trip away from his home country .
the 28-year-old techie will be at pains to eat , dress and talk just like the english do .
the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .
lessons in western ways in demand in the past two years , dozens of such institutes have been popping up in big indian cities like bangalore , hyderabad and pune .
the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .
that includes telling them about the western way of life , the geographic and demographic details of the various states they have to call and making them watch hollywood films and tapes with dialogue in american or canadian accents , " said soorej sachindran , who speaks with a perfect american accent despite never having been to the u.s. the team manager at manipal informatics , which does call center work for american and canadian companies , requires his employees learn american and canadian slang , something that comes in handy when trying to understand angry customers at the other end of the line .
" telemarkting means listening … and we have to tell our employees that the expletives and ' no 's ' are not directed against them , " he said .
germany on the outsourcing bandwagon the booming manners and language sector has yet to realize its full potential , as more and more companies shift operations to india .
german companies , especially , are pushing the trend .
all of lufthansa 's global reservations and inquiries are handled from india , and deutsche bank , siemens and daimlerchrysler have also outsourced international call center operations .
experts nevertheless think the outsourcing between germany and india has more room to grow .
" it 's a win-win situation for german companies .
india promises lower overhead costs , " said ketan shukla , the commerce attaché at the indian embassy in berlin .
on a recent visit to germany a high-powered indian it delegation lead by n.r. narayanmurthy , chairman of infosys , one of india 's biggest software groups , said that between 10,000 and 30,000 employees should be trained in german in the next two years .
verma is already ahead of the game .

the biblis nuclear power plant in hesse .
five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment . the operators of germany 's nuclear 18 power plants insist there is no need to re-open negotiations with the government on the closure of their facilities , according to german daily der tagesspiegel .
but some see things differently , including heide moser , the health and consumer protection minister for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
she has urged federal environment minister jürgen trittin to invite the power station operators to join him in a fresh round of talks .
" it would be a good idea for the federal environment minister to hold talks on shutting down individual reactors earlier than planned , " she told the paper .
schleswig-holstein is home to the brunsbüttel reactor , one of the five the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- wants to see closed down .
the other reactors are in the federal states of baden-württemberg -lrb- philippsburg 1 and obrigheim -rrb- , bavaria -lrb- isar 1 -rrb- and hesse -lrb- biblis 1 -rrb- .
the agency says these reactors are older models and have insufficient safeguards against a sept .
11-style terror attack in which a passenger plane would be crashed into a nuclear plant .
" better than nothing " but still " inadequate " the operators said they have agreed a " catalogue of measures " with the government which covered all the relevant security precautions .
environment minister jürgen trittin was therefore well aware of their plans to protect nuclear power plants from terror attacks , they said .
the energy spokesperson for the greens , michaele hustedt , said the government 's present catalogue of measures was " better than nothing " , but still " inadequate . "
she backed calls for fresh talks between the government and the operators on early closure saying the power produced by the older reactors could be taken from newer reactors instead .
nuclear power to be phased out in 20 years the government says there is no need to panic .
horst kubatschaka , the social democrat parliamentarian with special responsibility for nuclear power , criticized the bfs for going public with its findings .
" it would have been better if they had spoken to us first , " he told der tagesspiegel .
germany is planning to phase out nuclear power over the next 20 years , irrespective of any measures to cope with the threat of terror .
nuclear power is an emotionally-charged topic in germany : the transport of spent nuclear fuel attracts regular public protest and the greens ' party , the junior partners in chancellor schröder ' centre-left coalition , grew out of the anti-nuclear protest movement of the 1970s and 80s . dw staff -lrb- mc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agency : five german nuclear plants vulnerable to attacks the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks .

the global trend in exporting jobs to low-income countries like india has created a niche for institutes teaching indian workers how to dress , talk and eat like their western bosses . when mohan verma , an indian systems analyst , heads to london to work on a deutsche bank project , the butterflies in his stomach will be more than just the excitement of his first trip away from his home country .
the 28-year-old techie will be at pains to eat , dress and talk just like the english do .
the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .
lessons in western ways in demand in the past two years , dozens of such institutes have been popping up in big indian cities like bangalore , hyderabad and pune .
the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .
in france , the national minimum wage dates back to 1950 .
the system was revamped in the 1970s , and now has between 30 and 40 percent of the nation 's workforce , known as smicards , on its books .
they earn a monthly wage of € 1,215 and are well-respected members of society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.02.2004 germans debate introducing national minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leader frank bsirske promotes the idea .
germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .
in france , the national minimum wage dates back to 1950 .
the system was revamped in the 1970s , and now has between 30 and 40 percent of the nation 's workforce , known as smicards , on its books .
they earn a monthly wage of € 1,215 and are well-respected members of society .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .

11 hijacker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just tough talking - schily -lrb- right -rrb- with u.s. homeland security chief tom ridge .
during a u.s. visit to discuss the use of biometric technology in the war against terror , german interior minister otto schily denied that his country knowingly passed on information on a sep.11 hijacker to the cia . known for his tough , no-nonsense manner , schily enjoys a good reputation in washington : some political observers even believe that schily is one of the most-liked german politicians in the white house .
sure enough , there was enough evidence of that goodwill during the minister 's five-day visit to the u.s. dominated by security issues .
schily met for wide-ranging talks with america 's who 's-who of security and intelligence - u.s. attorney general john ashcroft , homeland security chief tom ridge , national security advisor condoleeza rice , cia chief george tenet and fbi head robert mueller . biometrics to the fore the discussions centered on the implementation of biometric technology to enhance existing security measures particularly when screening passengers entering the country .
at a meeting last october in berlin , both schily and ridge had attributed a " leading role " to the eu and the u.s. in the introduction of biometric data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily uses the iris scan machine at frankfurt airport starting this year the u.s. introduced finger-printing and digital photos for passengers entering the country with a visa .

26 deadline that the u.s. has set for germany and 27 other countries - whose citizens do not require a visa to the u.s. for a stay of up to 90 days - to issue biometric passports that would include a microchip containing electronic facial features or fingerprinting data . though schily made clear at a press conference on monday that , " the commitment of this date is no way thrown into question , " experts believe that most eu countries will fail to meet the deadline .
it 's not just the massive technical and logistics effort that is expected to hinder eu states in sticking to the given date , but also a lack of common standards on the introduction of biometric data , both within the eu as well as with the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric passport it still remains unclear which data -lrb- fingerprints , iris scans , facial recognition -rrb- and what storage technology will be used in the process .
though schily has warned that disparate regulations would complicate controls and disrupt air travel , he was vague on monday about whether he discussed the issue with the americans .
" yes , well , we have to see whether we can really do that -lrb- achieve common standards -rrb- , " he said . schily : " article is misleading " schily however was much more unequivocal that germans had " no idea " that a man whose first name and telephone number they passed on to u.s. authorities long before the sep.11 terrorist attacks would turn out to be a key player in the plot . the new york times reported earlier tuesday that german intelligence officials gave the cia the above information on marwan al-shehhi in march 1999 and asked the americans to track him .
the story , citing a senior german intelligence official , said that after the germans passed on the information to the cia , they did not hear form the americans about the matter until after sep .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .
trittin has announced that germany will stick to the deadline , ensuring further negotiations between the industry leaders and the greens to find a compromise . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions trading plan riles industry as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .
trittin has announced that germany will stick to the deadline , ensuring further negotiations between the industry leaders and the greens to find a compromise . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions trading plan riles industry as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out .

"
his comments come as one by one current member states have decided to either partially or fully close the door to workers from central and eastern europe .
the latest moves came yesterday by the uk and ireland , who indicated that they would consider curbing benefits for migrants from the new member states .
london and dublin , along with stockholm and the hague , led a group of states two years ago who said they would keep their markets open .
for the new member states who were fairly certain that the majority of others would take the same course , the turnaround comes as a shock .
the accession treaties allow member states to impose restrictions for up to seven years after enlargement .
however , given the sensitivities surrounding the question and the fact that governments can take the decisions on their own , the details of what they are actually planning to do are very murky .
" we have asked member states to give us the information , " said commission spokeswoman antonia mochan .
she added that by the end of january just two governments had complied .
this is not the first time that the ' old ' member states have worried about ' new ' ones .
when spain and portugal joined in 1986 , a seven year transitional period was also agreed .
however , because the fact that economic pick-up in these countries was so quick , the transition period was shortened .
in fact , a net amount of workers returned from the northern states to these two countries .

the global trend in exporting jobs to low-income countries like india has created a niche for institutes teaching indian workers how to dress , talk and eat like their western bosses . when mohan verma , an indian systems analyst , heads to london to work on a deutsche bank project , the butterflies in his stomach will be more than just the excitement of his first trip away from his home country .
the 28-year-old techie will be at pains to eat , dress and talk just like the english do .
the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .
lessons in western ways in demand in the past two years , dozens of such institutes have been popping up in big indian cities like bangalore , hyderabad and pune .
the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .
that includes telling them about the western way of life , the geographic and demographic details of the various states they have to call and making them watch hollywood films and tapes with dialogue in american or canadian accents , " said soorej sachindran , who speaks with a perfect american accent despite never having been to the u.s. the team manager at manipal informatics , which does call center work for american and canadian companies , requires his employees learn american and canadian slang , something that comes in handy when trying to understand angry customers at the other end of the line .
" telemarkting means listening … and we have to tell our employees that the expletives and ' no 's ' are not directed against them , " he said .
germany on the outsourcing bandwagon the booming manners and language sector has yet to realize its full potential , as more and more companies shift operations to india .
german companies , especially , are pushing the trend .
all of lufthansa 's global reservations and inquiries are handled from india , and deutsche bank , siemens and daimlerchrysler have also outsourced international call center operations .
experts nevertheless think the outsourcing between germany and india has more room to grow .
" it 's a win-win situation for german companies .
india promises lower overhead costs , " said ketan shukla , the commerce attaché at the indian embassy in berlin .
on a recent visit to germany a high-powered indian it delegation lead by n.r. narayanmurthy , chairman of infosys , one of india 's biggest software groups , said that between 10,000 and 30,000 employees should be trained in german in the next two years .

the global trend in exporting jobs to low-income countries like india has created a niche for institutes teaching indian workers how to dress , talk and eat like their western bosses . when mohan verma , an indian systems analyst , heads to london to work on a deutsche bank project , the butterflies in his stomach will be more than just the excitement of his first trip away from his home country .
the 28-year-old techie will be at pains to eat , dress and talk just like the english do .
the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .
lessons in western ways in demand in the past two years , dozens of such institutes have been popping up in big indian cities like bangalore , hyderabad and pune .
the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .
that includes telling them about the western way of life , the geographic and demographic details of the various states they have to call and making them watch hollywood films and tapes with dialogue in american or canadian accents , " said soorej sachindran , who speaks with a perfect american accent despite never having been to the u.s. the team manager at manipal informatics , which does call center work for american and canadian companies , requires his employees learn american and canadian slang , something that comes in handy when trying to understand angry customers at the other end of the line .
" telemarkting means listening … and we have to tell our employees that the expletives and ' no 's ' are not directed against them , " he said .
germany on the outsourcing bandwagon the booming manners and language sector has yet to realize its full potential , as more and more companies shift operations to india .
german companies , especially , are pushing the trend .
all of lufthansa 's global reservations and inquiries are handled from india , and deutsche bank , siemens and daimlerchrysler have also outsourced international call center operations .

the global trend in exporting jobs to low-income countries like india has created a niche for institutes teaching indian workers how to dress , talk and eat like their western bosses . when mohan verma , an indian systems analyst , heads to london to work on a deutsche bank project , the butterflies in his stomach will be more than just the excitement of his first trip away from his home country .
the 28-year-old techie will be at pains to eat , dress and talk just like the english do .
the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .
trittin has announced that germany will stick to the deadline , ensuring further negotiations between the industry leaders and the greens to find a compromise . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions trading plan riles industry as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .
trittin has announced that germany will stick to the deadline , ensuring further negotiations between the industry leaders and the greens to find a compromise . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions trading plan riles industry as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .
in france , the national minimum wage dates back to 1950 .
the system was revamped in the 1970s , and now has between 30 and 40 percent of the nation 's workforce , known as smicards , on its books .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .
in france , the national minimum wage dates back to 1950 .
the system was revamped in the 1970s , and now has between 30 and 40 percent of the nation 's workforce , known as smicards , on its books .
they earn a monthly wage of € 1,215 and are well-respected members of society .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's goalkeeper oliver kahn , center , raises the trophy in front of the team , after winning the18th german soccer championship , after the bundesliga match bayern munich vs. stuttgart may 17 , 2003 .
" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .

" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .

" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .
in france , the national minimum wage dates back to 1950 .
the system was revamped in the 1970s , and now has between 30 and 40 percent of the nation 's workforce , known as smicards , on its books .

"
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .
in france , the national minimum wage dates back to 1950 .
the system was revamped in the 1970s , and now has between 30 and 40 percent of the nation 's workforce , known as smicards , on its books .

11 hijacker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just tough talking - schily -lrb- right -rrb- with u.s. homeland security chief tom ridge .
during a u.s. visit to discuss the use of biometric technology in the war against terror , german interior minister otto schily denied that his country knowingly passed on information on a sep.11 hijacker to the cia . known for his tough , no-nonsense manner , schily enjoys a good reputation in washington : some political observers even believe that schily is one of the most-liked german politicians in the white house .
sure enough , there was enough evidence of that goodwill during the minister 's five-day visit to the u.s. dominated by security issues .
schily met for wide-ranging talks with america 's who 's-who of security and intelligence - u.s. attorney general john ashcroft , homeland security chief tom ridge , national security advisor condoleeza rice , cia chief george tenet and fbi head robert mueller . biometrics to the fore the discussions centered on the implementation of biometric technology to enhance existing security measures particularly when screening passengers entering the country .
at a meeting last october in berlin , both schily and ridge had attributed a " leading role " to the eu and the u.s. in the introduction of biometric data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily uses the iris scan machine at frankfurt airport starting this year the u.s. introduced finger-printing and digital photos for passengers entering the country with a visa .
the data is stored in a computer and can be compared with a terrorist and criminal database .
schily also kicked off a six-month pilot iris-scan project at the frankfurt airport this month -lrb- photo -rrb- . u.s.-imposed deadline a sore point but the main sticking point on the biometrics issue is an oct .
26 deadline that the u.s. has set for germany and 27 other countries - whose citizens do not require a visa to the u.s. for a stay of up to 90 days - to issue biometric passports that would include a microchip containing electronic facial features or fingerprinting data . though schily made clear at a press conference on monday that , " the commitment of this date is no way thrown into question , " experts believe that most eu countries will fail to meet the deadline .
it 's not just the massive technical and logistics effort that is expected to hinder eu states in sticking to the given date , but also a lack of common standards on the introduction of biometric data , both within the eu as well as with the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric passport it still remains unclear which data -lrb- fingerprints , iris scans , facial recognition -rrb- and what storage technology will be used in the process .
though schily has warned that disparate regulations would complicate controls and disrupt air travel , he was vague on monday about whether he discussed the issue with the americans .
" yes , well , we have to see whether we can really do that -lrb- achieve common standards -rrb- , " he said . schily : " article is misleading " schily however was much more unequivocal that germans had " no idea " that a man whose first name and telephone number they passed on to u.s. authorities long before the sep.11 terrorist attacks would turn out to be a key player in the plot . the new york times reported earlier tuesday that german intelligence officials gave the cia the above information on marwan al-shehhi in march 1999 and asked the americans to track him .
the story , citing a senior german intelligence official , said that after the germans passed on the information to the cia , they did not hear form the americans about the matter until after sep .

five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment . the operators of germany 's nuclear 18 power plants insist there is no need to re-open negotiations with the government on the closure of their facilities , according to german daily der tagesspiegel .
but some see things differently , including heide moser , the health and consumer protection minister for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
she has urged federal environment minister jürgen trittin to invite the power station operators to join him in a fresh round of talks .
" it would be a good idea for the federal environment minister to hold talks on shutting down individual reactors earlier than planned , " she told the paper .

" better than nothing " but still " inadequate " the operators said they have agreed a " catalogue of measures " with the government which covered all the relevant security precautions .
environment minister jürgen trittin was therefore well aware of their plans to protect nuclear power plants from terror attacks , they said .
the energy spokesperson for the greens , michaele hustedt , said the government 's present catalogue of measures was " better than nothing " , but still " inadequate . "
she backed calls for fresh talks between the government and the operators on early closure saying the power produced by the older reactors could be taken from newer reactors instead .
nuclear power to be phased out in 20 years the government says there is no need to panic .
horst kubatschaka , the social democrat parliamentarian with special responsibility for nuclear power , criticized the bfs for going public with its findings .
" it would have been better if they had spoken to us first , " he told der tagesspiegel .
germany is planning to phase out nuclear power over the next 20 years , irrespective of any measures to cope with the threat of terror .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.02.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc czechs nominate second eu commissioner prague is set to officially announce the czech ambassador to the eu , pavel telicka , as its new candidate .
last friday , milos kuzvart , the original czech candidate , who had been accepted by european commission president romano prodi surprised brussels by withdrawing his candidature .
as with his predecessor , telicka does not enjoy support from the main opposition civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- or from the small ruling coalition party , kdu-csl .
the former chief negotiator with the eu is criticized mainly for his membership of the communist party before 1989 .
" his nomination will present czech republic as a country where the bureaucratic skills are better off than a character , " the leader of kdu-csl , miroslav kalousek said according to czech press agency , -lrb- ctk -rrb- .
but telicka is convinced he is right for the job .
" i have always been critical both about myself and the eu - i do not look at it through rose-tinted glasses and maybe that is why i have managed to stick to it for so long , " ctk quoted him as saying .
telicka will be " twinned " with health and consumer protection commissioner david byrne .
telicka 's nomination , along with those of the nine other new member states will have to be approved by member states at a summit in march and then by the european parliament in mid-april .
the ten new commissioners will then start their new jobs in may .

"
his comments come as one by one current member states have decided to either partially or fully close the door to workers from central and eastern europe .
the latest moves came yesterday by the uk and ireland , who indicated that they would consider curbing benefits for migrants from the new member states .
london and dublin , along with stockholm and the hague , led a group of states two years ago who said they would keep their markets open .

" we are at a crossroads .
our europe needs a new political project " , he concluded , according to ap .
france was seen as one of the main reasons for last december 's failure to achieve agreement on the constitution due to its intransigence on key issues .
but the irish eu presidency has instilled new hope into the process , which once again appears to be gaining momentum .
the irish prime minister , bertie ahern , has been holding a series of bilateral meetings with leaders and will compile a progress report in march . chirac also repeated his case for a two-speed europe yesterday , saying that " pioneer groups " need to be set up that could move faster than others on some issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.02.2004 german industry and greens at loggerheads over emissions plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many credits are going up in smoke ?
german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .
trittin has announced that germany will stick to the deadline , ensuring further negotiations between the industry leaders and the greens to find a compromise . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de emissions trading plan riles industry as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .

german industry and unions are up in arms over an emissions trading system to cut pollution , even as the clock ticks on a march deadline for berlin to submit a list of companies and their carbon credits to the eu . the tug of war over germany 's controversial plans for an emissions allocation system , unveiled last month , showed no signs of easing this week even after a high-profile meeting between environment minister jürgen trittin and economics minister wolfgang clement . the emissions trading plan is a result of an eu bill passed last year , which makes it mandatory for eu member states to issue " carbon credits , " initially cost-free , to companies in the oil refining , energy , smelting , steel , cement , ceramics , glass and paper sectors .
the system is a crucial part of the eu 's commitment under the kyoto protocol to reduce emissions by 8 percent between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels . the emissions trading plan will effectively create a europe-wide market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the allotments include a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
offenders will also be able to buy extra credits to emit carbon from another company - the price will be determined by the emissions trading market . the system is scheduled to take effect in 2005 . industry skeptical of emissions trading plan though the emissions trading plan sounds simple on paper , in practice it is complicated by the various lobby groups vying to influence the system to suit their interests . trittin 's national allocation plan , which foresees issuing carbon credits to around 2,600 companies and is expected to lead to a 7.5 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2007 , has been criticized by the german economics ministry .
spearheaded by clement , the ministry says it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . the companies themselves complain that the plan forces them to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
many , who have already prematurely slashed their emissions , also accuse trittin of giving them too little carbon credits . unions fear job losses martin wansleben , head of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce said it was wrong to base the emissions trading plan on the industry 's voluntary offer from two years ago .
" what the environment minister is doing , is a trick .
he 's twisting words and saying if you have already promised that then i can count on the fact that it will work , " wansleben told deutsche welle .
" it 's like he 's saying ' we will become more catholic than the pope , we 'll become better than the others - even if it costs jobs and the economy ' . " trade unions are also warning of disadvantages for their sectors and a loss of jobs if trittin 's plan goes ahead in its present form .
erhard ott , chairman of the services union verdi , said the regulation would make coal-fired plants unprofitable and threaten thousands of jobs .
on the other hand , electric utilities that burn natural gas will be the most likely winners . carbon credits will amount to naught : greens environmental organizations have a radically different take on the issue .
" the industry just does n't get enough .
it 's absolutely shameless , what they 're demanding , " said climate expert regine günther of the world wide fund organization .
" they -lrb- the industry -rrb- want to raise their emissions .
that means : each one will get as much as he needs .
if that happens , the price of the carbon credits will be zero , " she added . trittin , a member of the green party insists that the emissions trading plan will help the industry meet their self-imposed goals of cutting pollutants .
" with the emissions trading system we want to help the industry to meet their promises of saving 45 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2012 and help them to actually implement it , " the minister said . meanwhile time is running out for germany to submit its list of 2,600 companies and its break-down of carbon credits among them to brussels by the end of march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.02.2004 germans debate introducing national minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leader frank bsirske promotes the idea .
germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .
in france , the national minimum wage dates back to 1950 .
the system was revamped in the 1970s , and now has between 30 and 40 percent of the nation 's workforce , known as smicards , on its books .
they earn a monthly wage of € 1,215 and are well-respected members of society .
despite this achievement , the system appears not to have served as a lasting cure for unemployment in the republic . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france slashes unemployment benefits french president jacque chirac vows to make jobs a focus in 2004 .

the global trend in exporting jobs to low-income countries like india has created a niche for institutes teaching indian workers how to dress , talk and eat like their western bosses . when mohan verma , an indian systems analyst , heads to london to work on a deutsche bank project , the butterflies in his stomach will be more than just the excitement of his first trip away from his home country .
the 28-year-old techie will be at pains to eat , dress and talk just like the english do .
the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .
lessons in western ways in demand in the past two years , dozens of such institutes have been popping up in big indian cities like bangalore , hyderabad and pune .
the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .
that includes telling them about the western way of life , the geographic and demographic details of the various states they have to call and making them watch hollywood films and tapes with dialogue in american or canadian accents , " said soorej sachindran , who speaks with a perfect american accent despite never having been to the u.s. the team manager at manipal informatics , which does call center work for american and canadian companies , requires his employees learn american and canadian slang , something that comes in handy when trying to understand angry customers at the other end of the line .
" telemarkting means listening … and we have to tell our employees that the expletives and ' no 's ' are not directed against them , " he said .
germany on the outsourcing bandwagon the booming manners and language sector has yet to realize its full potential , as more and more companies shift operations to india .
german companies , especially , are pushing the trend .
all of lufthansa 's global reservations and inquiries are handled from india , and deutsche bank , siemens and daimlerchrysler have also outsourced international call center operations .
experts nevertheless think the outsourcing between germany and india has more room to grow .
" it 's a win-win situation for german companies .
india promises lower overhead costs , " said ketan shukla , the commerce attaché at the indian embassy in berlin .
on a recent visit to germany a high-powered indian it delegation lead by n.r. narayanmurthy , chairman of infosys , one of india 's biggest software groups , said that between 10,000 and 30,000 employees should be trained in german in the next two years .

the global trend in exporting jobs to low-income countries like india has created a niche for institutes teaching indian workers how to dress , talk and eat like their western bosses . when mohan verma , an indian systems analyst , heads to london to work on a deutsche bank project , the butterflies in his stomach will be more than just the excitement of his first trip away from his home country .
the 28-year-old techie will be at pains to eat , dress and talk just like the english do .
the new graduate of a six-week manners and social behavior course at the cpi intellisoft center of excellence , verma , who did n't want to give his real name , brushed up on everything from how to talk on the phone to how to hold a fork .
intellisoft , in the city of hyderabad , is part of a booming cottage industry riding on the global wave of western companies outsourcing jobs in software and tech support to india .
last week , siemens announced plans to shift 15,000 jobs to eastern europe and india . german software giant sap is there as well , benefiting from the fact that they can pay their indian workers 17 percent of what their employees in the west get .
the outsourcing means new jobs for the 650,000 indian software professionals and brings with it a sharp increase in the amount of interaction with foreign clients .
but basic problems of communication remain in a country where phrases like , “ what is your good name , sir ? ” are still commonly used and where a man shaking hands with members of a group would leave out the women present . " other than the language , even simple things like head-nodding mean different things , " said professor herbert weber , who heads the fraunhofer institute for software and systems technology in berlin .
in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .
lessons in western ways in demand in the past two years , dozens of such institutes have been popping up in big indian cities like bangalore , hyderabad and pune .
the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .
that includes telling them about the western way of life , the geographic and demographic details of the various states they have to call and making them watch hollywood films and tapes with dialogue in american or canadian accents , " said soorej sachindran , who speaks with a perfect american accent despite never having been to the u.s. the team manager at manipal informatics , which does call center work for american and canadian companies , requires his employees learn american and canadian slang , something that comes in handy when trying to understand angry customers at the other end of the line .
" telemarkting means listening … and we have to tell our employees that the expletives and ' no 's ' are not directed against them , " he said .
germany on the outsourcing bandwagon the booming manners and language sector has yet to realize its full potential , as more and more companies shift operations to india .
german companies , especially , are pushing the trend .
all of lufthansa 's global reservations and inquiries are handled from india , and deutsche bank , siemens and daimlerchrysler have also outsourced international call center operations .
experts nevertheless think the outsourcing between germany and india has more room to grow .

in germany , a nod of the head usually means yes , whereas in india it is used for both yes and no and does n't carry much weight , according to weber .
" though the it world does not demand the social skills as required in the hospitality industry , one can not afford to distract clients at presentations with mannerisms that may appear odd , " diya banerjee , who runs a consulting firm that works with institutes that offer etiquette courses , told dw-world .
lessons in western ways in demand in the past two years , dozens of such institutes have been popping up in big indian cities like bangalore , hyderabad and pune .
the enrollment is not limited to individuals like verma , said banerjee .
multinational companies like ge capital also send their employees there .
" some of these institutes offer a wide variety of courses from accent change for call center workers to etiquette for techies , " she said .
although software companies employing high-end analysts in india have only recently begun using firms like intellisoft , call centers providing service support to western companies have been training workers to perfect foreign accents and deal with screaming customers for many years . " we have been reorienting our employees at call centers .
that includes telling them about the western way of life , the geographic and demographic details of the various states they have to call and making them watch hollywood films and tapes with dialogue in american or canadian accents , " said soorej sachindran , who speaks with a perfect american accent despite never having been to the u.s. the team manager at manipal informatics , which does call center work for american and canadian companies , requires his employees learn american and canadian slang , something that comes in handy when trying to understand angry customers at the other end of the line .
" telemarkting means listening … and we have to tell our employees that the expletives and ' no 's ' are not directed against them , " he said .
germany on the outsourcing bandwagon the booming manners and language sector has yet to realize its full potential , as more and more companies shift operations to india .
german companies , especially , are pushing the trend .
all of lufthansa 's global reservations and inquiries are handled from india , and deutsche bank , siemens and daimlerchrysler have also outsourced international call center operations .
experts nevertheless think the outsourcing between germany and india has more room to grow .
" it 's a win-win situation for german companies .
india promises lower overhead costs , " said ketan shukla , the commerce attaché at the indian embassy in berlin .
on a recent visit to germany a high-powered indian it delegation lead by n.r. narayanmurthy , chairman of infosys , one of india 's biggest software groups , said that between 10,000 and 30,000 employees should be trained in german in the next two years .
verma is already ahead of the game .
on his resume , his recently completed social behavior class sits next to a listing of his certificate in german from the goethe institute in pune . preeti john send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pursues better business ties to india though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .
money makes the ball go round " in the end it 's all about money , " bayern munich manager uli hoeneß said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on tuesday .
in an era when soccer has moved beyond the stadium and onto the stock exchange floor and once lucrative television rights have shriveled up , both teams are focusing steadily on the bottom line .
but that 's where the likeness ends .
whereas bayern adheres to the old school of turning a profit through sports wins , real sets its stakes on marketing and global branding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid fans cheer on beckham during tour in july 2003 .
" soccer is going the way of commerce and globalization , " real madrid 's sports director jorge valdano said , explaining his team 's business philosophy in the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung magazin .
with some pride he added that his team is moving faster in that direction than others .
" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .
on beckham 's first day with real madrid more than 8,000 jersey 's with his number 23 sold out at € 63 a piece .
a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .
profits before sports ?
for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .
but he is n't convinced hefty investment in players like zidane pay off in the long run .
for the cost of one of real 's star players , munich could pay for four or five .

" unlike others , we 're not ready to go into debt for a new player , " he told the frankfurt paper .
munich 's business philosophy is firmly grounded in the notion of building sports successes on sound financial footing .
" real has only started pulling itself out of debt now that fame is kicking in , " the german manager recalled , and added that things could change quickly if the team does n't continue its successes , or if one of the stars is benched for a season .
in fact , so far only beckham 's transfer has proved profitable , generating a kick-back well beyond the initial investment .
ronaldo and zidane have n't turned a profit yet , hoeneß pointed out .
for the german team , that 's reason enough to hold back on luring star players to the bavarian capital , even if they would help turn the team around on the pitch .
rather than focus on one or two big names , bayern is working to build up an across-the-board team and bring in new talents .
" we need young players , who are hungry and ready to work hard , " hoeneß said .
even if , such an approach does n't lead to the winner 's circle , in the long run , the bayern manager believes such a conservative financial strategy will pay off not only in goals but also in profits .

" one of the characteristics of real madrid is to always be ahead of the times , " he said .
and the times dictate expensive player transfers : david beckham for 35 million euros last year , ronaldo for 47 million euros a year before , and zidane for a record-breaking 75 million two years ago .
that 's money well spent , according to the sports director .
the players are the stars ; they 're the reason for the sold-out stadiums and the devout fan following .
they 're also the team 's ticket to financial success .

a tour of asia just after his signing brought in another € 8 million .
that 's cash the team can use to pad its € 270 million annual budget - the biggest in europe .
" we sell more tickets , do more tours and sign on more advertisers than competitors , " said valdano .
and that all has resulted in the wealthiest , most modern soccer team in the world .
real madrid is a global brand unlike any team before it .

for munich 's hoeneß , real madrid 's ticket to success has n't paid off yet .
" the real test is when economic wins parallel the team 's sports wins , " he said acknowledging the spaniards prowess on the pitch .

tuesday 's champions league game between bayern munich and real madrid ended in a 1-1 tie , but the clash of titans continues : dominating the sport like no other , the two teams reflect the old and new school of soccer . bayern munich 's coach had hoped for snow , and lot 's of it .
that would have evened up the chances for the german team when it faced off against real madrid for the most prestigious soccer competition on the continent .
but the weather gods could n't be persuaded to postpone the champions league knock-out match between the four-time winner from bavaria and the nine-time champ from spain , and so the battered german eleven took to the pitch on tuesday evening and hoped for the best .
earlier in the week , bayern 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge gave the team a 10 percent chance of beating real , but as the match approached , he whittled it down and said he had been too optimistic .
with star players like ronaldo , zidane and beckham , munich 's kahn and co. stood little chance of coming out victorious .
when the teams , arguably two of europe 's traditional powerhouses , entered munich 's olympic stadium , more than just a game of ball was at stake .
it was a battle of giants .
in 2001 bayern munich took home the champions cup and in 2002 real madrid stole it back .
the germans had a lot riding on the match especially after enduring a painful downwards spiral in the national bundesliga this past year , but for many in the business , the real meaning of the game had little to do with who came out winner .

the biblis nuclear power plant in hesse .
five nuclear power plants should be closed down early because they are vulnerable to a terror attack , according to a government watchdog .
the nuclear industry does n't seem to agree with the assessment . the operators of germany 's nuclear 18 power plants insist there is no need to re-open negotiations with the government on the closure of their facilities , according to german daily der tagesspiegel .
but some see things differently , including heide moser , the health and consumer protection minister for the northern german state of schleswig-holstein .
she has urged federal environment minister jürgen trittin to invite the power station operators to join him in a fresh round of talks .
" it would be a good idea for the federal environment minister to hold talks on shutting down individual reactors earlier than planned , " she told the paper .
schleswig-holstein is home to the brunsbüttel reactor , one of the five the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- wants to see closed down .
the other reactors are in the federal states of baden-württemberg -lrb- philippsburg 1 and obrigheim -rrb- , bavaria -lrb- isar 1 -rrb- and hesse -lrb- biblis 1 -rrb- .
the agency says these reactors are older models and have insufficient safeguards against a sept .

" better than nothing " but still " inadequate " the operators said they have agreed a " catalogue of measures " with the government which covered all the relevant security precautions .
environment minister jürgen trittin was therefore well aware of their plans to protect nuclear power plants from terror attacks , they said .
the energy spokesperson for the greens , michaele hustedt , said the government 's present catalogue of measures was " better than nothing " , but still " inadequate . "
she backed calls for fresh talks between the government and the operators on early closure saying the power produced by the older reactors could be taken from newer reactors instead .
nuclear power to be phased out in 20 years the government says there is no need to panic .
horst kubatschaka , the social democrat parliamentarian with special responsibility for nuclear power , criticized the bfs for going public with its findings .
" it would have been better if they had spoken to us first , " he told der tagesspiegel .
germany is planning to phase out nuclear power over the next 20 years , irrespective of any measures to cope with the threat of terror .
nuclear power is an emotionally-charged topic in germany : the transport of spent nuclear fuel attracts regular public protest and the greens ' party , the junior partners in chancellor schröder ' centre-left coalition , grew out of the anti-nuclear protest movement of the 1970s and 80s . dw staff -lrb- mc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agency : five german nuclear plants vulnerable to attacks the federal office for radiation protection -lrb- bfs -rrb- has called for the shut-down of five german nuclear energy plants because they lack sufficient protection against terror attacks .

11 hijacker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just tough talking - schily -lrb- right -rrb- with u.s. homeland security chief tom ridge .
during a u.s. visit to discuss the use of biometric technology in the war against terror , german interior minister otto schily denied that his country knowingly passed on information on a sep.11 hijacker to the cia . known for his tough , no-nonsense manner , schily enjoys a good reputation in washington : some political observers even believe that schily is one of the most-liked german politicians in the white house .
sure enough , there was enough evidence of that goodwill during the minister 's five-day visit to the u.s. dominated by security issues .
schily met for wide-ranging talks with america 's who 's-who of security and intelligence - u.s. attorney general john ashcroft , homeland security chief tom ridge , national security advisor condoleeza rice , cia chief george tenet and fbi head robert mueller . biometrics to the fore the discussions centered on the implementation of biometric technology to enhance existing security measures particularly when screening passengers entering the country .
at a meeting last october in berlin , both schily and ridge had attributed a " leading role " to the eu and the u.s. in the introduction of biometric data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily uses the iris scan machine at frankfurt airport starting this year the u.s. introduced finger-printing and digital photos for passengers entering the country with a visa .
the data is stored in a computer and can be compared with a terrorist and criminal database .
schily also kicked off a six-month pilot iris-scan project at the frankfurt airport this month -lrb- photo -rrb- . u.s.-imposed deadline a sore point but the main sticking point on the biometrics issue is an oct .
26 deadline that the u.s. has set for germany and 27 other countries - whose citizens do not require a visa to the u.s. for a stay of up to 90 days - to issue biometric passports that would include a microchip containing electronic facial features or fingerprinting data . though schily made clear at a press conference on monday that , " the commitment of this date is no way thrown into question , " experts believe that most eu countries will fail to meet the deadline .
it 's not just the massive technical and logistics effort that is expected to hinder eu states in sticking to the given date , but also a lack of common standards on the introduction of biometric data , both within the eu as well as with the u.s. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biometric passport it still remains unclear which data -lrb- fingerprints , iris scans , facial recognition -rrb- and what storage technology will be used in the process .
though schily has warned that disparate regulations would complicate controls and disrupt air travel , he was vague on monday about whether he discussed the issue with the americans .
" yes , well , we have to see whether we can really do that -lrb- achieve common standards -rrb- , " he said . schily : " article is misleading " schily however was much more unequivocal that germans had " no idea " that a man whose first name and telephone number they passed on to u.s. authorities long before the sep.11 terrorist attacks would turn out to be a key player in the plot . the new york times reported earlier tuesday that german intelligence officials gave the cia the above information on marwan al-shehhi in march 1999 and asked the americans to track him .
the story , citing a senior german intelligence official , said that after the germans passed on the information to the cia , they did not hear form the americans about the matter until after sep .
11 . " your article was a little bit misleading , " schily told a small group of reporters including one of the authors of the new york times article , reuters reported . the information was the earliest known clue the u.s. received about any of the hijackers and has now become a crucial element of an independent u.s. commission 's investigation into sep .
11 , 2001 .
u.s. officials say al-shehhi was the pilot who flew the second plane into the world trade center . a united arab emirates native , al-shehhi moved to germany in 1996 and became a key member of the al qaeda hamburg cell at the heart of the sept .
11 plot .
mohammed atta , one of the plot leaders , was his roommate . " routine " data exchange schily added that the indication that german intelligence officials had made a link between the name and an upcoming attack " is not true .
at that time we had no idea that -lrb- it -rrb- could be a thing like this -lrb- the sept .
11 attacks -rrb- . "
the minister said that germany gave the information on al-shehhi to the u.s. as part of " routine " data exchanges , adding that authorities were unable to connect the rather common arabic name " marwan " to a family name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cia director george tenet cia director george tennet -lrb- photo -rrb- also rejected suggestions that his agency had failed to act on the german tip .
speaking before an annual senate intelligence committee hearing on global threats on tuesday , tenet said , " in 1999 the germans gave us a name - marwan , that 's it , and a phone number .
and we did n't sit on our hands . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de look me in the eye forget passport controls and get ready for some eye contact next time you enter frankfurt airport .

schily met for wide-ranging talks with america 's who 's-who of security and intelligence - u.s. attorney general john ashcroft , homeland security chief tom ridge , national security advisor condoleeza rice , cia chief george tenet and fbi head robert mueller . biometrics to the fore the discussions centered on the implementation of biometric technology to enhance existing security measures particularly when screening passengers entering the country .

though schily has warned that disparate regulations would complicate controls and disrupt air travel , he was vague on monday about whether he discussed the issue with the americans .
" yes , well , we have to see whether we can really do that -lrb- achieve common standards -rrb- , " he said . schily : " article is misleading " schily however was much more unequivocal that germans had " no idea " that a man whose first name and telephone number they passed on to u.s. authorities long before the sep.11 terrorist attacks would turn out to be a key player in the plot . the new york times reported earlier tuesday that german intelligence officials gave the cia the above information on marwan al-shehhi in march 1999 and asked the americans to track him .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .
hundt further stated that if employment costs were artificially increased through the implementation of a national minimum wage , it would serve only to strip the country of simple jobs . while the arguments rage one way and the other , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have yet to make a decision .
speaking on germany 's public broadcast television ard , designated spd leader franz müntefering said that discussions were not over yet . european picture if germany is looking to europe to assess the good and bad effects of a minimum wage , the picture could be confusing .
britain introduced the system in the late 1990s and unemployment has fallen dramatically since then - a recent trade union council study calculated that some 1.3 million jobs were created in britain between 1997 and 2003 .
the monthly rate of € 1,124 , however , does n't go far in some parts of the country and low-wage earners find themselves having to take on more than one job to make ends meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarket cashier .
in france , the national minimum wage dates back to 1950 .
the system was revamped in the 1970s , and now has between 30 and 40 percent of the nation 's workforce , known as smicards , on its books .

germany is one of the few european countries which does not have a minimum wage .
but there are moves afoot among the nation 's unions to change that . with relatively generous wages and the shortest working week on the continent , workers in germany are likely the envy of many of their european counterparts .
but unlike their counterparts in many other countries on the continent , they do n't have the protection of a statutory minimum wage . politicians , employers and union representatives are currently getting tied up in knots over whether they should change the existing system or whether they should seriously consider implementing a wage packet minimum on home ground . leading the rallying call for a new system of wage payments is head of the service industry union verdi , frank bsirske .
against a backdrop of new regulations which will slash benefits of the long-term unemployed refusing to take a ' reasonable ' job - this could be poorly paid employment for which the applicant is overqualified or which could require relocation - bsirske told berliner zeitung that forcing people into jobs they ca n't live from would put greater pressure on wages .
on that basis , germany should think about introducing a statutory minimum wage , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaners could benefit .
bsirske received backing from the head of the german trade union federation , michael sommer .
" those looking for salvation in a far-reaching low-wage sector will fail in the long-term , " sommer told fuldaer zeitung .
further endorsement came from franz-josef möllenberg the head of the food and restaurant workers ' union , ngg .
" i am convinced it is the right way forward , " möllenberg told berliner zeitung on wednesday , adding that the minimum wage rate should be set at around € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,899 -rrb- per month .
the figure would be top the current high of € 1,402 in luxembourg . waves of criticism not surprisingly , the latest suggestions have drawn as much resistance as acceptance from employers , politicians and union representatives .
german economics minister wolfgang clement told reporters that he did n't think much of the idea .
" as far as i 'm concerned , it does n't make much sense , " he said .
it 's an opinion shared by fdp chairman , guido westerwelle , who believes the introduction of the new wage system would destroy more jobs than it would create . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt in an interview with berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper , the head of germany 's employers ’ association , dieter hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- , warned that standardizing national pay rates would mean to " seriously encroach on the system of collective agreements . "
he added that the current welfare system in germany was an " implied statutory minimum wage " in its own right .

in a full-page advert in the times , the group doctors for reform has called for compulsory health insurance .
consultant dr maurice slevin said : " the time has come for a genuine debate on the future of healthcare . "
the group says the nhs will not be able to meet public expectations .
but the labour party has claimed the group is a conservative party " front " .
the move comes as ex-bank chief derek wanless publishes his second report on improving the nation 's health .
' profound mistake ' the medics are challenging ministers who ruled the nhs should be funded by taxation , following an inquiry by mr wanless two years ago .
we will make a profound mistake if we leave this debate to politicians doctors for reform in its launch pamphlet , doctors for reform says : " we aim to start and participate in a proper and informed national debate on the choices ahead of us .
" the issues are beyond party politics and we believe ... we will make a profound mistake if we leave this debate to politicians . "
the group points to other systems , such as in france , germany and switzerland , which have a diverse range of healthcare suppliers and mixed funding systems , such as social insurance .
the doctors claim the nhs , in its current form , can no longer be considered the finest healthcare system in the world .
poorer people would have their insurance premiums subsidised or paid virtually in full , says the paper .
dr maurice slevin , a consultant medical oncologist , said the nhs is unable to treat the patient as a consumer .
" i have patients who say they feel they are victims of the system , " he told bbc news online .
" this is not a drive to privatise but a drive to give people consumer power and stop them being treated in this very inefficient manner . "
a founding member of the group , christoph lees , a consultant in obstetrics and foetal maternal medicine , said : " we owe it to ourselves and future generations to have this debate now . "
government rejects idea the doctors ' call was rejected by health secretary john reid , who said the current system was fairer .
speaking on bbc radio 4 's the world at one , dr reid said the french system was effectively bankrupt with a 10 billion euro deficit .
he said : " what is being suggested here is a system which is not funded by everyone , it is a social insurance system ... where it is only funded by employers and employees - those in work . "
dr reid said that was effectively a tax on work and was inequitable as it would give contributors a far bigger say over their treatment .
doctors for reform were not in tune with thinking across the nhs , he said .
tim yeo , shadow secretary of state for health and education , tim yeo mp , said the government 's response was " outrageous " .
he said : " ¿ i find it hugely depressing that the government will not tolerate any other opinion on the nhs other than their own . "
the group insists it is an all-party group that did not back the tory " patients passports " voucher policy .

in a full-page advert in the times , the group doctors for reform has called for compulsory health insurance .
consultant dr maurice slevin said : " the time has come for a genuine debate on the future of healthcare . "
the group says the nhs will not be able to meet public expectations .
but the labour party has claimed the group is a conservative party " front " .
the move comes as ex-bank chief derek wanless publishes his second report on improving the nation 's health .
' profound mistake ' the medics are challenging ministers who ruled the nhs should be funded by taxation , following an inquiry by mr wanless two years ago .
we will make a profound mistake if we leave this debate to politicians doctors for reform in its launch pamphlet , doctors for reform says : " we aim to start and participate in a proper and informed national debate on the choices ahead of us .
" the issues are beyond party politics and we believe ... we will make a profound mistake if we leave this debate to politicians . "
the group points to other systems , such as in france , germany and switzerland , which have a diverse range of healthcare suppliers and mixed funding systems , such as social insurance .
the doctors claim the nhs , in its current form , can no longer be considered the finest healthcare system in the world .
poorer people would have their insurance premiums subsidised or paid virtually in full , says the paper .

the report by treasury adviser derek wanless is thought likely to cast doubt on the value of big initiatives to promote healthier lifestyles .
the study will make the case for stronger political leadership and urge a 20-year campaign to cut coronary heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
working class lifestyles are likely to be blamed for health inequalities .
uk health inequalities : a woman born in kensington and chelsea has a life expectancy 6.8 years greater than one born in manchester in 1997-9 , male life expectancy at birth was 71.1 years for unskilled manual men versus 78.5 years for professionals " why we need to improve public health " the report is expected to focus on to poor diet , lack of exercise , and alcohol abuse .
it could signal a shift in emphasis by the government away from finding more efficient ways to deliver health care to focusing on how best to encourage individuals to lead a healthy lifestyle .
mr wanless told the bbc : " the report looks at the things that are causing people to get ill and what the government should try to do .
but this will only work if people want it to . "
" we have got to see a move from a sickness service - which is what the nhs is - through looking after chronic diseases well , to helping people stay in good health . "
he is thought to favour strong action to reduce smoking rates , including possibly a workplace ban .
wasteful campaigns he may also put forward plans for a national framework for public health and a new national independent body to monitor the nation 's health and provide information to people on managing their health .
the report is expected to be critical of existing targets to reduce health inequalities , on the grounds information is poor , and many are not achievable in the absence of other policy measures .
it is also reported mr wanless will criticise the way millions of pounds have been spent on public health education campaigns without any evidence they actually work .
mr wanless was commissioned to write the report by the government his report , securing good health for the whole population , will say that the onus for improving health must fall not just on the government , but on schools , and individuals themselves .
this is the second major report mr wanless , former group chief executive of natwest bank , has produced for the government .
in 2002 , he was asked to assess the level of resources needed for the nhs to provide a comprehensive service .
he said a massive injection of cash was required over the next 20 years to meet patient demand - results used by chancellor gordon brown to justify a hike in health service funds .
unhealthy nation : the average consumption of fruit and vegetables among adults in england is less than three portions a day .
recommended amount is five less than two in five men do enough weekly physical activity over one in five adults is obese .
in 2001 , 15 % of 15 year olds were obese a quarter of men and a sixth of women drink more than the recommended safe level paul burstow , liberal democrat health spokesman , said it was now time for ministers to deliver a " coherent and sustained public health strategy . "
" the nhs is poorly equipped to lead the public health drive .
we need a cross-government approach which harnesses the creative energies of the media and food industry , works with our schools and local councils , and supports parents , " he said .
tim yeo , shadow secretary of state for health and education , said : " since taking office in 1997 , labour has failed to give public health problems the priority they deserve .
" it is therefore not surprising that obesity rates have risen sharply , sexually-transmitted diseases have worsened and cases of tb have become more prevalent . "
niall dickson , chief executive of the health watchdog the king 's fund , told the bbc : " today 's report is a wake up call , not just for the government , but for the whole of society .

the report by treasury adviser derek wanless is thought likely to cast doubt on the value of big initiatives to promote healthier lifestyles .
the study will make the case for stronger political leadership and urge a 20-year campaign to cut coronary heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
working class lifestyles are likely to be blamed for health inequalities .

it could signal a shift in emphasis by the government away from finding more efficient ways to deliver health care to focusing on how best to encourage individuals to lead a healthy lifestyle .
mr wanless told the bbc : " the report looks at the things that are causing people to get ill and what the government should try to do .
but this will only work if people want it to . "
" we have got to see a move from a sickness service - which is what the nhs is - through looking after chronic diseases well , to helping people stay in good health . "
he is thought to favour strong action to reduce smoking rates , including possibly a workplace ban .
wasteful campaigns he may also put forward plans for a national framework for public health and a new national independent body to monitor the nation 's health and provide information to people on managing their health .
the report is expected to be critical of existing targets to reduce health inequalities , on the grounds information is poor , and many are not achievable in the absence of other policy measures .
it is also reported mr wanless will criticise the way millions of pounds have been spent on public health education campaigns without any evidence they actually work .
mr wanless was commissioned to write the report by the government his report , securing good health for the whole population , will say that the onus for improving health must fall not just on the government , but on schools , and individuals themselves .
this is the second major report mr wanless , former group chief executive of natwest bank , has produced for the government .
in 2002 , he was asked to assess the level of resources needed for the nhs to provide a comprehensive service .
he said a massive injection of cash was required over the next 20 years to meet patient demand - results used by chancellor gordon brown to justify a hike in health service funds .
unhealthy nation : the average consumption of fruit and vegetables among adults in england is less than three portions a day .
recommended amount is five less than two in five men do enough weekly physical activity over one in five adults is obese .
in 2001 , 15 % of 15 year olds were obese a quarter of men and a sixth of women drink more than the recommended safe level paul burstow , liberal democrat health spokesman , said it was now time for ministers to deliver a " coherent and sustained public health strategy . "
" the nhs is poorly equipped to lead the public health drive .
we need a cross-government approach which harnesses the creative energies of the media and food industry , works with our schools and local councils , and supports parents , " he said .
tim yeo , shadow secretary of state for health and education , said : " since taking office in 1997 , labour has failed to give public health problems the priority they deserve .
" it is therefore not surprising that obesity rates have risen sharply , sexually-transmitted diseases have worsened and cases of tb have become more prevalent . "

imf managing director horst koehler said japan may grow 3 % this year , ahead of the imf 's previous 2.2 % forecast .
business spending and asian exports would drive the recovery , he said .
the change of stance follows figures putting growth at an annual rate of 7 % at the end of last year - but showing prices were falling faster than ever .
the rise in the value of the yen in recent months means imports are getting cheaper , accelerating the deflation that has dogged japan for some years .
backing mr koehler was speaking to the media following meetings with the japanese economy minister , heizo takenaka .
" japan 's economic prospects have clearly brightened , " he said , noting the 1.7 % expansion in the final three months of 2003 - the fastest gdp growth in 13 years .
" in our view , " he said , " the -lrb- gdp growth -rrb- number goes more to 3 % , possibly even beyond that . "
he complimented mr takenaka 's efforts to clean up the banking system , still groaning under the weight of bad debts accumulated largely during the " bubble economy " years of the 1980s .
and he also gave his backing to recent attempts by the bank of japan to massage the yen lower by selling the currency - although he warned it was only a temporary measure .
falling prices but mr koehler also took account of the deflation problem .
taking into account the slide in prices , growth in the fourth quarter was a rather more subdued 0.7 % .
deflation makes debts bigger and is continuing to hamper the domestic economy , making japanese consumers reluctant to spend since goods will be cheaper in the future .
the fall in import prices because of the strong yen has been a key driver for recent deflation - a situation which unfortunately also means japanese exports are more expensive .
since exports are the main driver of the recovery so far , the fear is that the yen 's rise can not be arrested and the economy could stall once more .

she insisted the criminal procedure -lrb- amendment -rrb- -lrb- scotland -rrb- bill would safeguard victims ' rights .
ms jamieson was speaking prior to the first full parliamentary vote on plans for major high court reform .
lawyers have described as " unworkable " the proposals to appoint legal representation for an absent accused .
the legislation is intended to bring in a raft of reforms to the criminal court system , ranging from scrapping the historic 110-day rule to extending the sentencing powers of sheriff courts .
the cross-party justice 1 committee is urging msps to back the general principles of the bill in wednesday 's stage 1 debate but has raised some concerns over the legislation , including trials in absence and the tagging plans .
however , ms jamieson urged msps to help the scottish executive deliver a court system " designed around the needs of the law-abiding many , and not for the convenience of the law-breaking few " . "
it is to recognise the right to justice of those victims that we have proposed this measure " cathy jamieson msp the committee last week rejected the argument that an accused could be tried in their absence from the outset , after senior legal figures rubbished the idea .
the faculty of advocates and the law society of scotland , who welcomed the bill 's broad principles , said they would be unable to properly represent an accused without their instructions during evidence-taking , and both warned that their members would most likely refuse to take on such a role .
the committee 's stage 1 report found " some merit " in allowing a trial to go ahead in the absence of the accused once all the evidence had been led and called on ministers to amend the proposals along these lines .
ms jamieson acknowledged that the plans had proved controversial and said she would " carefully " consider the committee 's views .
but she added : " in 2002 , victims in 90 trials for serious crimes were left in limbo as their chance for justice disappeared in front of their eyes .
" in each of those 90 cases the reason was the non-appearance of the accused .
" it is to recognise the right to justice of those victims that we have proposed a measure in our high court reform bill to allow some trials to progress even where the accused has absented him or herself .
" there need to be safeguards to ensure that such trials are only taken forward when every other avenue has been exhausted . "

the labour peer said their money would help universities compete with their english counterparts once top-up fees are introduced in the south .
he said the move may prove impractical but was worth consideration .
mr watson said : " why should n't all those who have graduated in the past 25 years make a contribution ?
" if graduates benefit by earning more than those without a degree , then so do those who graduated over the period when the rapid expansion of higher education took place . "
but tory enterprise spokesman murdo fraser described mr watson 's suggestion as " ridiculous " .
endowment policy the former tourism , culture and sport minister also suggested the £ 2,000 endowment which graduates currently pay should be increased .
the endowment , paid by graduates after they leave university , is used to pay for grants and bursaries for students from poorer backgrounds .
but he said increasing the endowment would free up more scottish executive cash to plough into universities .
mr watson added : " there is no reason the amount they -lrb- students -rrb- pay should not also increase . "
top-up fees will allow english universities to charge students up to £ 3,000 per year - a move ruled out north of the border by the executive .
scottish universities are worried english institutions will become richer and attract more students and staff as a result of the increased funding from fees .
they have called for an extra £ 100m from the executive .

the base silver coin , bearing the face of emperor domitianus , was found by brian malin as he combed a field in oxfordshire with a metal detector .
only one other such coin exists , showing the face of the man who ruled britain for just four days , but was dismissed as a hoax .
mr malin 's coin is on exhibition at the british museum in london .
experts say his discovery proves the earlier coin , found in france 100 years ago , was genuine and that domitianus did exist .
the coin , estimated to be worth more than £ 10,000 , goes on display on wednesday at the british museum in london .
brian malin deserves a lot of credit because he did not even delve into the jar dr chris howgego , ashmolean museum historians believe domitianus was briefly the roman ruler of britain , an upstart from the legion who was ousted for treason for daring to declare himself emperor and having the coins made .
mr malin , a father of one who has been searching for treasure with his metal detector for more than 15 years , found the coin in a field in april last year , 10 miles south-east of oxford .
it was in a pot of 5,000 others , stuck together and also bearing the heads of emperors .
dating from 250ad to about 275ad , they spanned five emperors and a time of great upheaval for the roman empire .
domitianus was probably ousted for treason for having the coins made richard abdy , roman coin curator at the british museum , said : " the roman empire was beginning to fray .
domitianus , it looks , ruled in 271ad and there was only one coin with his image .
" there have been references to domitianus in two ancient texts but they described him as an officer who had been punished for treason . "
dr chris howgego , curator for roman coins at the ashmolean museum , said : " it is exciting and valuable and interesting .
" brian malin deserves a lot of credit because he did not even delve into the jar and brought it into the museum punctually and he is rather sweet .
" he has not once asked about the value - he has asked ' how important is this and what can we learn ? " '
in line with britain 's treasure trove laws , a coroner 's inquest will be held and an independent panel will decide how much the 5,000-coin hoard is worth .
the panel will then mediate between the ashmolean , which has said it wants to buy the pot of coins , and mr malin .

the base silver coin , bearing the face of emperor domitianus , was found by brian malin as he combed a field in oxfordshire with a metal detector .
only one other such coin exists , showing the face of the man who ruled britain for just four days , but was dismissed as a hoax .
mr malin 's coin is on exhibition at the british museum in london .
experts say his discovery proves the earlier coin , found in france 100 years ago , was genuine and that domitianus did exist .
the coin , estimated to be worth more than £ 10,000 , goes on display on wednesday at the british museum in london .
brian malin deserves a lot of credit because he did not even delve into the jar dr chris howgego , ashmolean museum historians believe domitianus was briefly the roman ruler of britain , an upstart from the legion who was ousted for treason for daring to declare himself emperor and having the coins made .
mr malin , a father of one who has been searching for treasure with his metal detector for more than 15 years , found the coin in a field in april last year , 10 miles south-east of oxford .
it was in a pot of 5,000 others , stuck together and also bearing the heads of emperors .
dating from 250ad to about 275ad , they spanned five emperors and a time of great upheaval for the roman empire .
domitianus was probably ousted for treason for having the coins made richard abdy , roman coin curator at the british museum , said : " the roman empire was beginning to fray .
domitianus , it looks , ruled in 271ad and there was only one coin with his image .
" there have been references to domitianus in two ancient texts but they described him as an officer who had been punished for treason . "
dr chris howgego , curator for roman coins at the ashmolean museum , said : " it is exciting and valuable and interesting .
" brian malin deserves a lot of credit because he did not even delve into the jar and brought it into the museum punctually and he is rather sweet .
" he has not once asked about the value - he has asked ' how important is this and what can we learn ? " '
in line with britain 's treasure trove laws , a coroner 's inquest will be held and an independent panel will decide how much the 5,000-coin hoard is worth .
the panel will then mediate between the ashmolean , which has said it wants to buy the pot of coins , and mr malin .

last year , more than 13 million working days were lost to stress-related illnesses in the workplace , the money programme has found .
" our trade union legal officers have reported massive increases in the number of cases of stress , " said tom mellish of the tuc .
" there 's something like 6,400 cases of stress actually waiting at the moment to go through the courts . "
prison the health and safety executive -lrb- hse -rrb- have decided that it is time to act and crack down on those employers they find are not measuring up , starting with the national health service .
employers believe it is natural to be tired after a normal day at work the west dorset hospital trust is one of the first to be put on notice to reduce stress levels amongst its staff .
" nursing is a stressful profession , there is no doubt about it , " said jenny price , a senior nurse manager at the hospital .
" but when it 's compounded by an environment or a situation that you feel people are n't listening to you , and they 're not putting systems in place to help you , then you 're bound to get stressed . "
if the hospital does not comply with the improvement notice , then the managers could face a £ 20,000 fine or even 6 months in jail .
normal but not everyone agrees with the hse .
employers ' organisations like the institute of directors insist that the problem is exaggerated .
they point out that average working hours in britain are going down and argue that the term stress has just become popularised .
" people are now describing working a normal day 's period of time in the office as being stressful , " said dr richard wilson , business policy executive at the institute of directors .
finding the cause the money programme conducted a test to find out just what was stressing british workers .
the programme followed the lives of three people : mark antrobus from yorkshire , a heating engineer and a slave to his mobile phone who drives 1,000 miles a week to his appointments and constantly worries about the next job .
" i blame a lot of my problems on my mobile phone " , said mr antrobus .
" it was a great working tool 15 years ago when i got one .
" since then it has become a burden . "
suzanne dale from north london , a single working mother trying to balance a difficult job with a demanding home life .
" being a lone parent with a child and combining that with a job is a major stressor , " ms dale said .
" stress and me and how i sort of bury it and ignore it is a feature of my life and i think that 's very much about having to just cope . "
john hurley from essex , a share trader living on his nerves to try and stay one step ahead of the market .
" it 's always at the back of your mind that you 're trading yours and your family 's money , " mr hurley admitted .
" but you also realise that you need to take x amount of risk because you trade for yourself , and whatever money you do make will go straight into your pocket . "
monitors the money programme followed the three from dawn to dusk and examined how big a role stress plays in their working day .
and with the help of the country 's top stress expert , the programme asked how much damage their daily stress levels could be causing .
" some people will react badly , other people will be able to take the pressures and the demands put upon them very well , " said university of london 's professor eric brunner .
the money programme devised a test which has the three wear heart monitors during a typical working day to identify the times when they are under the greatest stress .
they also filled out questionnaires and filmed video diaries describing their feelings about work .
this gave professor brunner insight into why they were stressed .
solutions one of mr antrobus ' greatest cause of stress is his constant phone calls and the fact that he is putting in enormous effort into his work without feeling that he gets much reward .
to combat stress and to focus on his own health , mr antrobus " could take up yoga , he could take up martial art -lsb- or -rsb- go swimming " , said professor brunner .
mr hurley , meanwhile , suffers from stress largely to the " rather monotonous and repetitive " nature of his work , professor brunner said .
" what he 's got to do is to take as many breaks as he can , perhaps go to the gym or swimming pool , " he said .
ms dale should try to find the right " balance of her work and her personal family life " professor brunner said .
" she needs to pay more attention to finding some ways of relaxing and enjoying herself rather than spending her entire waking hours either looking after her son or looking after her patients and clients .
" clearly , she is rarely off duty . "
" burnt out britain " will be broadcast on wednesday , 25 february at 1930 gmt on bbc two .

representatives of more than 150 uk companies had gathered at great george street in london to hear him put the case for more uk firms investing in iraq .
alternating fluently to deal with queries in english and arabic he reiterated the case that , despite continuing outbreaks of violence , iraq is a country where the british are welcome .
" the whole country needs to be rebuilt and i hope that uk firms will be able to help that process , " he said .
what will happen ?
is there going to be privatisation ?
it adds an air of uncertainty which is not helpful at the moment .
dr mostafa ali bazergan , iraq infosearch the best opportunities would be investing in longer-term projects such as selling consumer goods , he said .
" there are many successful markets where uk firms can get involved , an entrepreneurial culture , and increasing consumer confidence .
" whether they win contracts or not should be down to competitive bidding and no other factors . "
areas where uk firms could bid for work included infrastructure development , communications , healthcare , water and banking , he said .
' growth opportunity ' one of those attending the conference was david herman , director of development at services and engineering firm amec .
" we have a joint venture in iraq with us firm fluor , " he told bbc news online .
" we are in the country working on a massive project providing facilities .
" we are bidding for other major contracts .
it is a growth opportunity for uk companies and think there will be many others looking to win contracts there . "
amec 's contract is for the restore iraqi electricity project , but there have been accusations that most of the major contracts are going to us firms .
us firms have won major contracts to repair oil fields recently work worth $ 2bn to help repair the war-torn country 's devastated oil and gas industry was awarded to us firms .
however tom foley , head of private sector development at the us-led coalition provisional authority in iraq , said uk companies were not being disadvantaged .
" we believe there is a great opportunity there .
iraq is going to be a big economy with rapid growth rates , " he told bbc news online .
" we think it will be the economic powerhouse of the middle east , and we think uk firms should establish a strong position and take advantage of this fantastic opportunity .
" there has been interest from uk firms of all sizes and i am very confident there will be continued interest . "
' situation will improve ' there has been continued violence in iraq since the official ending of hostilities .
the trade brochure inviting uk firms to consider iraq contains a list of 19 private security companies they may want to hire .
" there is a security problem , there is no doubt about that , " dr allawi acknowledged .
but most of the country is relatively secure , he insisted .
" by and large , i think the situation will improve and iraq should be little different from certain parts of the developing world where things may not be 100 % up to international security standards , " he said .
he also hinted at forthcoming sales of state owned assets .
" privatisation could be introduced over a wide range of activities .
if it is better for the public for market criteria to be applied , then they will be , " dr allawi said .
" there have been a number of state companies which have been mismanaged in recent years , and which can not be supported .
however this will be looked at on a case-by-case basis . "
he said unemployment was coming down , " to between 20-28 % " , and that oil price and production issues were being addressed .
' conflicting messages ' but a london-based consultancy said dr allawi and the us-led administration was " painting too rosy a picture " .
" we are getting conflicting messages out of iraq , " dr mostafa ali bazergan of iraq infosearch told bbc news online .
" there is a lot of talk about privatisation and it is lurking there in the shadows , but no-one is clearly explaining what it might entail .
" what will happen ?
is there going to be privatisation ?
it adds an air of uncertainty which is not helpful at the moment .
" the most important thing is dealing with unemployment .
i believe the unemployment figure is many times the official figures .
" they should be trying to relieve this problem before talk of privatisation . "

gibson remains one of hollywood 's biggest movie heartthrobs , being named best actor at the us people 's choice awards for the third time in four years .
but at 48 , he was too old to play jesus in the passion - so satisfied himself with co-writing , directing , producing and financing it .
after earning his spurs behind the camera with braveheart , which he directed and produced as well as starred in , he decided he had " a deep need " to tell the story of christ 's final hours .
he has wanted to make this film for the last decade , and has said he has tried to make a familiar story less distant .
" the gospels tell you what basically happened - i want to know what really went down , " he said last year .
gibson himself is a conservative catholic - and has previously told interviewers about his opposition to abortion , birth control and divorce .
but his religious views are not as conservative as those held by his father , hutton , who set up a group called alliance for catholic tradition and questioned the extent of the holocaust .
mel gibson has avoided publicly criticising his 82-year-old father , saying : " he never denied the holocaust - he just said there were fewer than six million . "
mel was born in new york , the sixth of 11 children , and moved to australia in 1968 after his father won an injury payout and the tv quiz jeopardy .
he soon adopted an australian accent after being teased for being a " yank " , and performed at the australian national institute of dramatic arts .
alcohol battle while there , he played romeo opposite judy davis ' juliet , and shared accommodation with shine star geoffrey rush .
like kylie minogue , he started his screen career with a role in tv soap the sullivans before finding film fame in mad max in 1979 .
the futuristic film became an unexpected hit , taking $ 100m around the world , and spawned two sequels .
more acclaimed roles in films like war drama gallipoli and the year of living dangerously - both directed by peter weir - followed before his hugely successful appearance in 1987 's cop thriller lethal weapon .
around this time , he also began his battle with alcohol after realising he was drinking four or five beers every morning before work - later attending alcoholics anonymous and becoming teetotal .
lethal weapon was a global smash , and established gibson on the hollywood a-list , with three sequels helping his image and bank balance .
directing but he wanted to prove he was more than a hollywood hunk , and won high critical praise in hamlet in 1990 before directing his first film , the man without a face , three years later .
the next film he directed was also his next big success - braveheart scored five oscars in 1996 , including best picture and best director .
a string of thriller and action movies like ransom , the patriot and signs along with lighter fare such as what women want followed - and proved he is still a major draw at the box office .
and with his fee reputed to have reached $ 25m -lrb- £ 13m -rrb- per film , he has accumulated enough cash to be able to make films like the passion without having to rely on big studios .
he has also said he prefers directing to acting .
" it 's more fun , that 's all there is to it , " he has said .
" it 's essentially the same job , which is storytelling , but you have more control over the way you want to tell the story . "

mel gibson directed jim caviezel in the passion of the christ gibson remains one of hollywood 's biggest movie heartthrobs , being named best actor at the us people 's choice awards for the third time in four years .
but at 48 , he was too old to play jesus in the passion - so satisfied himself with co-writing , directing , producing and financing it .
after earning his spurs behind the camera with braveheart , which he directed and produced as well as starred in , he decided he had " a deep need " to tell the story of christ 's final hours .
he has wanted to make this film for the last decade , and has said he has tried to make a familiar story less distant .
" the gospels tell you what basically happened - i want to know what really went down , " he said last year .
gibson himself is a conservative catholic - and has previously told interviewers about his opposition to abortion , birth control and divorce .
gibson has directed three films during his career but his religious views are not as conservative as those held by his father , hutton , who set up a group called alliance for catholic tradition and questioned the extent of the holocaust .
mel gibson has avoided publicly criticising his 82-year-old father , saying : " he never denied the holocaust - he just said there were fewer than six million . "
mel was born in new york , the sixth of 11 children , and moved to australia in 1968 after his father won an injury payout and the tv quiz jeopardy .
he soon adopted an australian accent after being teased for being a " yank " , and performed at the australian national institute of dramatic arts .
alcohol battle while there , he played romeo opposite judy davis ' juliet , and shared accommodation with shine star geoffrey rush .
braveheart won five oscars in 1996 like kylie minogue , he started his screen career with a role in tv soap the sullivans before finding film fame in mad max in 1979 .
the futuristic film became an unexpected hit , taking $ 100m around the world , and spawned two sequels .
more acclaimed roles in films like war drama gallipoli and the year of living dangerously - both directed by peter weir - followed before his hugely successful appearance in 1987 's cop thriller lethal weapon .
around this time , he also began his battle with alcohol after realising he was drinking four or five beers every morning before work - later attending alcoholics anonymous and becoming teetotal .
lethal weapon was a global smash , and established gibson on the hollywood a-list , with three sequels helping his image and bank balance .
directing but he wanted to prove he was more than a hollywood hunk , and won high critical praise in hamlet in 1990 before directing his first film , the man without a face , three years later .
he has remained one of hollywood 's biggest box office stars the next film he directed was also his next big success - braveheart scored five oscars in 1996 , including best picture and best director .
a string of thriller and action movies like ransom , the patriot and signs along with lighter fare such as what women want followed - and proved he is still a major draw at the box office .
and with his fee reputed to have reached $ 25m -lrb- £ 13m -rrb- per film , he has accumulated enough cash to be able to make films like the passion without having to rely on big studios .
he has also said he prefers directing to acting .
" it 's more fun , that 's all there is to it , " he has said .
" it 's essentially the same job , which is storytelling , but you have more control over the way you want to tell the story . "

the firm said it earned $ 1.69bn -lrb- £ 890m -rrb- in 2003 , slightly ahead of expectations but down 4 % on the year before .
the culprit for the falling profits was the rise of both the south african rand and the australian dollar against the weakening us dollar .
most of anglo 's costs are incurred in the two currencies .
rising prices despite the currency problems - which cost the firm $ 578m - anglo said it had managed to find cost savings of $ 335m in 2003 , improving on the $ 200m it had aimed for .
and it said rising commodity prices in 2004 - the first significant price turnaround in close on two decades - would offset its currency problems .
sales in 2003 had shown a solid 22 % rise to almost $ 25bn , anglo said , driven largely by demand for diamonds , platinum and paper .
as for profits , however , both diamonds and gold were hit hard by the currency issue , as well as by sliding quality of ore in malian mines , the firm said .
gold production should grow sharply in 2004 , however , as anglo completes its acquisition of ghana 's ashanti goldfields .
the firm won a fiercely contested takeover battle with randgold in 2003 .

rising prices despite the currency problems - which cost the firm $ 578m - anglo said it had managed to find cost savings of $ 335m in 2003 , improving on the $ 200m it had aimed for .
and it said rising commodity prices in 2004 - the first significant price turnaround in close on two decades - would offset its currency problems .
sales in 2003 had shown a solid 22 % rise to almost $ 25bn , anglo said , driven largely by demand for diamonds , platinum and paper .
as for profits , however , both diamonds and gold were hit hard by the currency issue , as well as by sliding quality of ore in malian mines , the firm said .
gold production should grow sharply in 2004 , however , as anglo completes its acquisition of ghana 's ashanti goldfields .
the firm won a fiercely contested takeover battle with randgold in 2003 .

more than 12,000 products ranging from cutlery and champagne to sofas and garden benches , will be sold at the 70,000sq ft branch , near the metrocentre .

" it 's a brand new shopping experience that 's all about individuality and accessibility .
we 're confident it has something for everyone . "
the concentration on home interiors is part of m & s 's attempt to reinvigorate sales across the board .
its clothing and homeware ranges dropped 2.3 % in like-for-like sales for the seven weeks to 10 january .

turkey is often held up as a model of islamic democracy .
the separation of public secular identity from private religious practice is fiercely defended by the country 's powerful military .
it 's a separation which many here in turkey are keen to show the world .
they want to present a country which is secular , modern and western .
it was an image captured perfectly in last year 's turkish winning entry in the eurovision song contest .
sparsely-clad sertab erener 's song " every way that i can " fused eastern rhythms and hip-hop and became the country 's first-ever winner . "
even prime minister erdogan suffers - his daughters wear the headscarf .
but he has the money to send them to the us to be educated , so they can keep wearing the scarf " gulden sonmez human rights activist but that image does not reflect the whole of turkey .
in fact , it is estimated that as many as 65 % of turkish women cover their heads with a scarf .
but women wearing headscarves are not allowed to enter state-controlled areas such as schools , universities , or government offices .
since 1997 , when the ban came to be more strictly enforced , growing numbers of these women have been travelling abroad to pursue a university education .
after 24-year-old semra batur was excluded from her turkish university , she and many of her fellow students continued their studies in azerbaijan .
" of course it was difficult but we had to do it , " she says .
" i did what i had to do , because i wanted to continue my education .
" we have the right to an education . "
special responsibility mazlumder is an islamic organisation that helps women like semra .
they say that since the headscarf ban was enforced , more than 10,000 women in istanbul alone have been excluded from universities .
these women and their families expressed their frustration in general elections in 2002 , when they voted turkey 's ak party , which has its roots in islamist politics , into power .
now they say their government is not doing enough to help them .
" this government , because of its nature , has more responsibility to solve the problem , " says mazlumder official gulden sonmez .
" even prime minister erdogan suffers - his daughters wear the headscarf .
" but he has the money to send them to the united states to be educated , so they can keep wearing the scarf .
" people are hugely frustrated . "
the election of a government with roots in political islam has made the issue more complex .
the government declined to speak on the subject , but an ak party spokeswoman said it considered the headscarf problem to be one of human rights - if turkey 's overall human rights record improved , the issue would be resolved .
confrontation risk privately members of the ak party may wish to remove the headscarf ban .
the wives of cabinet ministers have themselves been criticised for covering their heads at official state functions . "
it is a sign of solidarity with the islamist groups ...
but also maybe it 's a type of protest .
they are protesting against the modernisation programme " nilufer narli political scientist but the ak party is also anxious to avoid alienating the powerful turkish military - and with some cause , since the last islamist government was quietly deposed by the army in 1998 .
and many staunch secularists like cuneyt akalin of istanbul 's marmara university also remain suspicious of the government 's islamic roots .
they support the recent french ruling and believe the headscarf ban in turkey must continue .
" in a public space , people should act according to the rules , " mr akalin says .
" i teach at a public university .
in a public space i have some obligations , and so do the students .
" i totally defend it there is no other way of it . "
mr akalin also thinks the europeans do not have a clear view of the situation in turkey .
" we have been fighting for this for 200 years , " he says .
" turkey was the pioneer of this struggle . "
wigs many young islamist women attempt to reconcile their personal religious beliefs with their desire for an education by removing the headscarf outside the university gates and wearing a wig instead .
but is this purely a question of individual conscience ?
political scientist nilufer narli of kadir has university believes the headscarf wearers are making a very public political statement .
" in the modern urban context , it is more a political symbol , " she says .

it 's a separation which many here in turkey are keen to show the world .
they want to present a country which is secular , modern and western .

even prime minister erdogan suffers - his daughters wear the headscarf .
but he has the money to send them to the us to be educated , so they can keep wearing the scarf gulden sonmez human rights activist but that image does not reflect the whole of turkey .
in fact , it is estimated that as many as 65 % of turkish women cover their heads with a scarf .
but women wearing headscarves are not allowed to enter state-controlled areas such as schools , universities , or government offices .
since 1997 , when the ban came to be more strictly enforced , growing numbers of these women have been travelling abroad to pursue a university education .
after 24-year-old semra batur was excluded from her turkish university , she and many of her fellow students continued their studies in azerbaijan .
" of course it was difficult but we had to do it , " she says .
" i did what i had to do , because i wanted to continue my education .

the election of a government with roots in political islam has made the issue more complex .
the government declined to speak on the subject , but an ak party spokeswoman said it considered the headscarf problem to be one of human rights - if turkey 's overall human rights record improved , the issue would be resolved .
confrontation risk privately members of the ak party may wish to remove the headscarf ban .
the wives of cabinet ministers have themselves been criticised for covering their heads at official state functions .

they are protesting against the modernisation programme nilufer narli political scientist but the ak party is also anxious to avoid alienating the powerful turkish military - and with some cause , since the last islamist government was quietly deposed by the army in 1998 .
and many staunch secularists like cuneyt akalin of istanbul 's marmara university also remain suspicious of the government 's islamic roots .
they support the recent french ruling and believe the headscarf ban in turkey must continue .

in a public space i have some obligations , and so do the students .

these women and their families expressed their frustration in general elections in 2002 , when they voted turkey 's ak party , which has its roots in islamist politics , into power .
now they say their government is not doing enough to help them .
pm erdogan has disappointed many supporters with headscarf stand " this government , because of its nature , has more responsibility to solve the problem , " says mazlumder official gulden sonmez .
" even prime minister erdogan suffers - his daughters wear the headscarf .
" but he has the money to send them to the united states to be educated , so they can keep wearing the scarf .
" people are hugely frustrated . "
the election of a government with roots in political islam has made the issue more complex .
the government declined to speak on the subject , but an ak party spokeswoman said it considered the headscarf problem to be one of human rights - if turkey 's overall human rights record improved , the issue would be resolved .
confrontation risk privately members of the ak party may wish to remove the headscarf ban .
the wives of cabinet ministers have themselves been criticised for covering their heads at official state functions .
it is a sign of solidarity with the islamist groups ...
but also maybe it 's a type of protest .
they are protesting against the modernisation programme nilufer narli political scientist but the ak party is also anxious to avoid alienating the powerful turkish military - and with some cause , since the last islamist government was quietly deposed by the army in 1998 .
and many staunch secularists like cuneyt akalin of istanbul 's marmara university also remain suspicious of the government 's islamic roots .
they support the recent french ruling and believe the headscarf ban in turkey must continue .
" in a public space , people should act according to the rules , " mr akalin says .
" i teach at a public university .
in a public space i have some obligations , and so do the students .
" i totally defend it there is no other way of it . "
mr akalin also thinks the europeans do not have a clear view of the situation in turkey .
" we have been fighting for this for 200 years , " he says .
" turkey was the pioneer of this struggle . "
wigs many young islamist women attempt to reconcile their personal religious beliefs with their desire for an education by removing the headscarf outside the university gates and wearing a wig instead .
but is this purely a question of individual conscience ?
political scientist nilufer narli of kadir has university believes the headscarf wearers are making a very public political statement .
an estimated 65 % of women traditionally wear the headscarf " in the modern urban context , it is more a political symbol , " she says .
" it is a sign of solidarity with the islamist groups . "
ms narli thinks if these young women can prove they are part of an islamist network , their access to jobs and future career are guaranteed in one way or another .
" but also maybe it 's a type of protest , " she adds .
" they are protesting against the modernisation programme in turkey , in the same way that they were protesting in france against what they saw as a failed integration programme . "
despite internal tensions , turkey 's cherished secularism is not likely to change , at least while the military continues to support it .
as long as this is the case , the law will discriminate against those women who believe , for whatever reason , they have no choice but to cover their heads .
it will also have the potential to radicalise islamists , both women and men , across the country .

gustavo de aristegui is a member of parliament for the conservative popular party in government .
the popular party flatly denies wielding any untoward influence in the media .
but i put it to mr aristegui that , according to the 1980 law , any government that holds an absolute majority in parliament , like this one , must therefore also have absolute influence over the public broadcaster .
" that is preposterous ! " came the reply .
" of course the director general of the news output at television espanola has political opinions , we all do , but he is doing his best in his job and it is insulting to the professional integrity of the workers at tve to suggest they are being controlled by the government . "
but curra ripolles , an employee at television espanola , says she has personal as well as professional experience of government influence at the public broadcaster .
in may last year , her brother was one of 62 spanish peacekeepers killed on their way home from afghanistan when their plane crashed over turkey .
elections the flight had been chartered by the spanish government and the families of those who died accused the government of having taken a cheap rather than safe option .

opinion polls show that many spaniards are still undecided as to how they will vote .
the government is criticised for not changing a biased media law politicians up and down the country are on the campaign trail .
that and information in the spanish media should help people make up their minds .
yet there are nagging doubts at home and abroad .
the international federation of journalists has criticised the lack of impartiality in the spanish press .
in spain , a number of writers , academics , singers , journalists and actors have set up a platform to lament the absence of open political debate .
there are those who blame this on spain 's relatively young democracy .
" the spanish press is filled with silences ...
this is a left-over of dictatorship emilio silva freelance journalist the spanish constitution was signed only 25 years ago , on the back of 40 years of fascist dictatorship under francisco franco .
" the spanish press is filled with silences , " freelance journalist emilio silva said .
" so often when i 'm out to lunch with another journalist , they say to me ' oh i wish i could write this report or that report , ' but they ca n't because they are subject to unofficial political censures .
" this is a left-over of dictatorship . "
choice ?
yet a visit to one of madrid 's numerous newspaper stands will show you that choice is not the problem .
there are countless newspapers , magazines and also private radio and television stations .
the problem for many spaniards though is that each one has a distinct political bias .
this , of course , is common the world over in the privately-owned media but spain 's public broadcaster , too , has come under fire .
of course the director general of the news output at television espanola has political opinions , we all do , but he is doing his best in his job gustavo de aristegui mp for the popular party last month , the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe cited spain 's public radio and television channels as an example of " news manipulation " .
at television espanola itself , over half the employees formed an independent advisory council , in the face of what they describe as " the growing manipulation which is seriously undermining the credibility of the public channel and its workers " .
the roots of the problem lie in spanish law .
maria pilar , a professor of media law at madrid university explains that according to a law passed in 1980 to regulate the public broadcaster , spanish radio and television can not be anything but politicised .
" every time there is a general election in spain , the new prime minister appoints the head of the public broadcaster , " she said .
" the committee elected to help them in their job is then also newly formed to represent proportionately the size of each political party in parliament .
" how can spanish public television and radio not be politicised with this law ?
public tv is accused of censoring criticism from soldiers ' families " of course the opposition parties always say they 'll change it .. but when they get in to government , it is no longer in their interest to do so . "
