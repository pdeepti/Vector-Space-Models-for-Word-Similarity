experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .

experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .
bergmann also has plans for expansion : " my objective is to rent an office sometime and to employ somebody else .

fished from the mediterranean two weeks ago , italy has refused to let them land .
now rome 's parliament may decide their fate . italian opposition parliamentarians are calling on interior minister giuseppe pisanu to allow the aid ship to enter the sicilian harbor empedocle to facilitate medical aid for those on board . two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said cap anamur director elias bierdel . “ we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said . while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources say that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem . “ we are a humanitarian organization .
we have a ship and we are trying to save lives .
we are very surprised to find the european union now uses gun boats to prevent us from doing that , " bierdel said . dozens of illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean from northern africa to southern europe each day – many of them die trying .
an estimated 5,000 african immigrants drowned on the sea crossing in the past year alone . " there are so many people in need and we don ’ t get the impression that the italian or spanish or greek coastguards are inclined to do anything to help them , " said bierdel . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the first wave of boat people in germany twenty-five years ago , the first vietnamese " boat people " arrived in germany after risking death in a daring flight from home .

unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "

unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .
" the economic cycle continues its upward trend , whereas this is having no effect whatsoever on the jobless rate . "
the paper added that " even the latest figures provide little hope : a reversal of the economic trend is still not in sight . "
the paper 's editors concluded that germans need to concentrate on producing and providing more innovative and high-quality goods and services , which is the key to prosperity . dw-radio send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

fished from the mediterranean two weeks ago , italy has refused to let them land .
now rome 's parliament may decide their fate . italian opposition parliamentarians are calling on interior minister giuseppe pisanu to allow the aid ship to enter the sicilian harbor empedocle to facilitate medical aid for those on board . two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said cap anamur director elias bierdel . “ we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said . while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources say that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem . “ we are a humanitarian organization .
we have a ship and we are trying to save lives .
we are very surprised to find the european union now uses gun boats to prevent us from doing that , " bierdel said . dozens of illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean from northern africa to southern europe each day – many of them die trying .

fished from the mediterranean two weeks ago , italy has refused to let them land .
now rome 's parliament may decide their fate . italian opposition parliamentarians are calling on interior minister giuseppe pisanu to allow the aid ship to enter the sicilian harbor empedocle to facilitate medical aid for those on board . two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said cap anamur director elias bierdel . “ we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said . while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources say that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem . “ we are a humanitarian organization .
we have a ship and we are trying to save lives .
we are very surprised to find the european union now uses gun boats to prevent us from doing that , " bierdel said . dozens of illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean from northern africa to southern europe each day – many of them die trying .

unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .
" the economic cycle continues its upward trend , whereas this is having no effect whatsoever on the jobless rate . "
the paper added that " even the latest figures provide little hope : a reversal of the economic trend is still not in sight . "

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

according to the newspaper le monde , sarkozy said , " it is important that an independent european body communicates how its decisions are taken , not just to the markets but also to the citizens .
in a democracy , it is important that this is explained " .
the ecb , which has sole responsibility for setting interest rates for the 12 countries that share the euro , neither publishes minutes of its meetings nor details of how its board members voted on monetary policy .
instead , ecb president jean-claude trichet gives a closely-watched press conference immediately after the decision is taken .
the lack of written evidence has led to criticism that it lacks transparency and that it is harder for the markets to predict what interest rate decisions it will take .
in countries such as the uk , canada , the us and sweden , markets pour over published minutes of monetary policy decisions and votes and attempt to speculate on whether the bank is likely to change its stance in the future .

negotiations on the issue are currently going on between the french-speaking belgian socialist and liberal parties .
according to sources close to the negotiations , the socialists , who currently hold the commission post , may grant the position to michel , who is a liberal .
michel has refused to comment on what he calls " only hypothetical . "
the current belgian portfolio within the commission is research , occupied by the ex-president of the belgian french-speaking socialist party , philippe busquin .
however , la libre belgique notes that michel is more interested in an external relations-related portfolio such as enlargement or development .
during his job as belgian foreign minister , which he has filled since 1999 , michel has become known for his outspoken criticism of american policy towards iraq , as well as for his ambitious peacemaking efforts , notably in africa .

the current belgian portfolio within the commission is research , occupied by the ex-president of the belgian french-speaking socialist party , philippe busquin .
however , la libre belgique notes that michel is more interested in an external relations-related portfolio such as enlargement or development .
during his job as belgian foreign minister , which he has filled since 1999 , michel has become known for his outspoken criticism of american policy towards iraq , as well as for his ambitious peacemaking efforts , notably in africa .

" siemens is passing on the baton to young leaders , " the company , that hires 417,000 employees worldwide , said in a statement .
kleinfeld , who was appointed to the top rung of the company - the central supervisory board - only last year , had so far successfully headed siemens ' business in the united states .
the decision comes as a surprise because so far there had been talk of extending pierer 's term by a year or two .
the 63-year-old pierer will move to the supervisory board where he will be chairman . more briefs 07.07.2004 -pipe- schily : world cup 2006 will benefit germany 06.07.2004 -pipe- helping hand for pharmaceutical industry 06.07.2004 -pipe- east germans possess less buying power 06.07.2004 -pipe- clamp down on illegal building workers 05.07.2004 -pipe- schröder weighs in on longer work week 05.07.2004 -pipe- karstadtquelle to cut more jobs 05.07.2004 -pipe- service industry sees growth slowdown 02.07.2004 -pipe- germany sells russian debt bonds radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

according to the newspaper le monde , sarkozy said , " it is important that an independent european body communicates how its decisions are taken , not just to the markets but also to the citizens .
in a democracy , it is important that this is explained " .
the ecb , which has sole responsibility for setting interest rates for the 12 countries that share the euro , neither publishes minutes of its meetings nor details of how its board members voted on monetary policy .
instead , ecb president jean-claude trichet gives a closely-watched press conference immediately after the decision is taken .
the lack of written evidence has led to criticism that it lacks transparency and that it is harder for the markets to predict what interest rate decisions it will take .
in countries such as the uk , canada , the us and sweden , markets pour over published minutes of monetary policy decisions and votes and attempt to speculate on whether the bank is likely to change its stance in the future .

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .

questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .

just over 4.2 million people were registered jobless - 60,000 less than in the previous month , and 25,300 less compared with a year ago . however , experts say the slight decrease is misleading because the number of participants taking part in training schemes no longer count towards the number of unemployed .

just over 4.2 million people were registered jobless - 60,000 less than in the previous month , and 25,300 less compared with a year ago . however , experts say the slight decrease is misleading because the number of participants taking part in training schemes no longer count towards the number of unemployed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.07.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc politics stall decision on german elite universities the president of berlin 's humboldt university , jürgen mlynek , has sharply criticized the failure of federal and regional governments to reach an agreement on creating an elite university program .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , mlynek said he was " incredibly disappointed with political power tactics . "
federal and state research and education ministers met yesterday to agree the details of the program , which aims to put germany universities on equal footing with the likes of oxford or harvard .
states governed by the christian democratic union said there were still differences to be settled in terms of the financing and design of the program , and they called for the federalism commission to discuss the plan before its implementation .
it is now possible that the program , worth € 1.9 billion -lrb- $ 2.33 billion -rrb- , will not be implemented in the coming year as planned .
following yesterday 's meeting , germany 's minister for education and research , edelgard bulmahn , said that the unresolved issues would be cleared up by the next commission session in november .
she also said she was hopeful that in spite of the delay , the plan would go ahead next year . more briefs 06.07.2004 -pipe- spiderman swings into berlin 06.07.2004 -pipe- increasing food handouts for needy germans 06.07.2004 -pipe- schäuble opposes security council for germany 05.07.2004 -pipe- possible new computer tax 05.07.2004 -pipe- dozens forced to leave islamic school 05.07.2004 -pipe- clamping down on benefit recipients 05.07.2004 -pipe- no respite for germany 's jobless 05.07.2004 -pipe- german state bans smoking in schools radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.07.2004 blair calls for an end to guantanamo prison camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friction is growing over the release of four britons from camp delta during a meeting with lawmakers on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair called the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay an " anomaly that must end " during tough questioning over his relationship with washington . british prime minister tony blair strayed from his own personal party line and openly criticized the united states ’ policy regarding the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay in cuba .
addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.07.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc politics stall decision on german elite universities the president of berlin 's humboldt university , jürgen mlynek , has sharply criticized the failure of federal and regional governments to reach an agreement on creating an elite university program .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , mlynek said he was " incredibly disappointed with political power tactics . "
federal and state research and education ministers met yesterday to agree the details of the program , which aims to put germany universities on equal footing with the likes of oxford or harvard .
states governed by the christian democratic union said there were still differences to be settled in terms of the financing and design of the program , and they called for the federalism commission to discuss the plan before its implementation .

in an interview with the berliner zeitung , mlynek said he was " incredibly disappointed with political power tactics . "
federal and state research and education ministers met yesterday to agree the details of the program , which aims to put germany universities on equal footing with the likes of oxford or harvard .
states governed by the christian democratic union said there were still differences to be settled in terms of the financing and design of the program , and they called for the federalism commission to discuss the plan before its implementation .
it is now possible that the program , worth € 1.9 billion -lrb- $ 2.33 billion -rrb- , will not be implemented in the coming year as planned .
following yesterday 's meeting , germany 's minister for education and research , edelgard bulmahn , said that the unresolved issues would be cleared up by the next commission session in november .

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .

committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .

at a meeting in kiel , german federal interior minister otto schily stressed that in light of the growing danger posed by islamic terrorism , " all information had to be saved and analyzed centrally in future . "
schily urged the regional interior ministers to enshrine the same in unambigious legislation .
schily called the current practice , whereby different domestic intelligence agencies at the state and federal levels shared information , " unsatisfactory . "
however , ministers were unable to agree on the establishment of a central eu register that would facilitate the exchange of information about absconding and suspected criminals between different european countries . more briefs 07.07.2004 -pipe- court throws out ' day after tomorrow ' plagiarism charge 02.07.2004 -pipe- cultural capital candidates present applications 02.07.2004 -pipe- negotiations to update military 's computers fail 02.07.2004 -pipe- bundestag approves social welfare reform 02.07.2004 -pipe- eleven year jail term for bus hijacker 02.07.2004 -pipe- former bayern coach turns down national team job 30.06.2004 -pipe- government aims to grant gay couples more rights 30.06.2004 -pipe- man arrested in jet bomb scare radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the 57-year old economist , who was active in the felipe gonzález government in spain , was also a frequent visitor to brussels as a spanish mp when he represented the national parliament in the body that drew up the draft european constitution .
the other two candidates up for presidential nomination , austrian hannes swoboda and slovene borut pahor , withdrew their nominations tuesday after it became clear that it was a two-man race .
should the traditional power-sharing arrangement between the socialists and the center-right european people 's party be confirmed as expected , then borrell would succeed out-going parliament head pat cox later this month .
in the second half of the five-year legislative period , the center-right would then take over , with current epp group leader hans-gert pöttering likely taking the helm .

in an interview with the berliner zeitung , mlynek said he was " incredibly disappointed with political power tactics . "
federal and state research and education ministers met yesterday to agree the details of the program , which aims to put germany universities on equal footing with the likes of oxford or harvard .
states governed by the christian democratic union said there were still differences to be settled in terms of the financing and design of the program , and they called for the federalism commission to discuss the plan before its implementation .
it is now possible that the program , worth € 1.9 billion -lrb- $ 2.33 billion -rrb- , will not be implemented in the coming year as planned .
following yesterday 's meeting , germany 's minister for education and research , edelgard bulmahn , said that the unresolved issues would be cleared up by the next commission session in november .
she also said she was hopeful that in spite of the delay , the plan would go ahead next year . more briefs 06.07.2004 -pipe- spiderman swings into berlin 06.07.2004 -pipe- increasing food handouts for needy germans 06.07.2004 -pipe- schäuble opposes security council for germany 05.07.2004 -pipe- possible new computer tax 05.07.2004 -pipe- dozens forced to leave islamic school 05.07.2004 -pipe- clamping down on benefit recipients 05.07.2004 -pipe- no respite for germany 's jobless 05.07.2004 -pipe- german state bans smoking in schools radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

trying to eradicate prejudices , arab universities are beginning to offer courses in western culture to their students .
but some experts fear that these efforts wo n't do much to change entrenched views . the middle east discovers the west : in dubai , for example , the private gulf research center is offering students a series of events about the future of the enlarged european union .
in march , werner weidenfeld , a political science professor from munich , lectured at the center , which was founded by abdulaziz sager , a saudi business man . the american university in cairo recently opened a center for american studies , mainly financed by saudi prince waleed bin talal after the new york mayor turned down a donation . interest in the west is not a new thing : many academic institutions in the arab world already offer their students courses in western languages .
but these programs usually do n't include lessons about western culture , politics and society in general , according to experts . " there 's a general lack of knowledge , " said martin beck , a researcher for the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg .
he added that many arab students go abroad , but usually focus on technical or science subjects . state-run universities a problem ? history plays a role in explaining why european or american culture has received little attention in the middle east so far , said omar kamil , an egyptian political scientist who currently works at the simon dubnow institute for jewish history and culture at leipzig university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lecture at a university in cairo during the 1950s , many countries in the middle east took over universities that were privately run until that time .

" instead of following the reason of modernity , universities revert to the past , which hampers , if not blocks , our steps towards modernity , " he said . on the other hand , several universities have begun to research the western way of life .
the u.s. takes on a central role in this respect .
" the united states have practically become neighbors , " said beck , who taught at palestinian birzeit university for three years .
" they 've become a major force in the region . " enormous interest in the west while teaching at birzeit , beck realized that his students there knew much more about europe and the u.s. than their contemporaries in the west .
their knowledge might not always be correct , beck said .
" but the level of interest is enormous , and not only in the palestinian territories . " beck said he rarely encountered religious fanatics or nationalists among his students .
kamil saw things differently . " the state-run universities produce ideologists , chauvinists and religious fanatics , " he said , adding that self-criticism was not something people were interested in . an outdated fear of the christian west prevents an opening towards its culture , kamil said .
beck , who conducted a survey on anti-americanism , disagreed . " people distinguish between u.s. foreign policy and american culture , " he said .

trying to eradicate prejudices , arab universities are beginning to offer courses in western culture to their students .
but some experts fear that these efforts wo n't do much to change entrenched views . the middle east discovers the west : in dubai , for example , the private gulf research center is offering students a series of events about the future of the enlarged european union .
in march , werner weidenfeld , a political science professor from munich , lectured at the center , which was founded by abdulaziz sager , a saudi business man . the american university in cairo recently opened a center for american studies , mainly financed by saudi prince waleed bin talal after the new york mayor turned down a donation . interest in the west is not a new thing : many academic institutions in the arab world already offer their students courses in western languages .
but these programs usually do n't include lessons about western culture , politics and society in general , according to experts . " there 's a general lack of knowledge , " said martin beck , a researcher for the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg .
he added that many arab students go abroad , but usually focus on technical or science subjects . state-run universities a problem ? history plays a role in explaining why european or american culture has received little attention in the middle east so far , said omar kamil , an egyptian political scientist who currently works at the simon dubnow institute for jewish history and culture at leipzig university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lecture at a university in cairo during the 1950s , many countries in the middle east took over universities that were privately run until that time .
" they no longer were places of free thinking , but became centers for state propaganda instead , " kamil said , adding that until today only literary works approved by the establishment can be read in the humanities . " instead of following the reason of modernity , universities revert to the past , which hampers , if not blocks , our steps towards modernity , " he said . on the other hand , several universities have begun to research the western way of life .
the u.s. takes on a central role in this respect .
" the united states have practically become neighbors , " said beck , who taught at palestinian birzeit university for three years .
" they 've become a major force in the region . " enormous interest in the west while teaching at birzeit , beck realized that his students there knew much more about europe and the u.s. than their contemporaries in the west .
their knowledge might not always be correct , beck said .
" but the level of interest is enormous , and not only in the palestinian territories . " beck said he rarely encountered religious fanatics or nationalists among his students .
kamil saw things differently . " the state-run universities produce ideologists , chauvinists and religious fanatics , " he said , adding that self-criticism was not something people were interested in . an outdated fear of the christian west prevents an opening towards its culture , kamil said .
beck , who conducted a survey on anti-americanism , disagreed . " people distinguish between u.s. foreign policy and american culture , " he said .
but he added that the distinction was starting to blur after the war in iraq . while universities could help in that respect , beck said that it was difficult to change negative feelings towards the america . " u.s. policy will not be judged differently when people study american culture , " he said . kamil also said he fears that interest in the west is " fashionable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.07.2004 " me incorporated " boom begins to affect jobless stats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 're in the driving seat now the number of people without work in germany has slightly decreased in the past 12 months .
experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .
bergmann also has plans for expansion : " my objective is to rent an office sometime and to employ somebody else .
i have hope .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.07.2004 german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .
unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .
" the economic cycle continues its upward trend , whereas this is having no effect whatsoever on the jobless rate . "
the paper added that " even the latest figures provide little hope : a reversal of the economic trend is still not in sight . "
the paper 's editors concluded that germans need to concentrate on producing and providing more innovative and high-quality goods and services , which is the key to prosperity . dw-radio send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said cap anamur director elias bierdel . “ we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said . while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources say that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem . “ we are a humanitarian organization .
we have a ship and we are trying to save lives .
we are very surprised to find the european union now uses gun boats to prevent us from doing that , " bierdel said . dozens of illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean from northern africa to southern europe each day – many of them die trying .
an estimated 5,000 african immigrants drowned on the sea crossing in the past year alone . " there are so many people in need and we don ’ t get the impression that the italian or spanish or greek coastguards are inclined to do anything to help them , " said bierdel . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the first wave of boat people in germany twenty-five years ago , the first vietnamese " boat people " arrived in germany after risking death in a daring flight from home .

unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .
" the economic cycle continues its upward trend , whereas this is having no effect whatsoever on the jobless rate . "
the paper added that " even the latest figures provide little hope : a reversal of the economic trend is still not in sight . "

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .

just over 4.2 million people were registered jobless - 60,000 less than in the previous month , and 25,300 less compared with a year ago . however , experts say the slight decrease is misleading because the number of participants taking part in training schemes no longer count towards the number of unemployed .
if the labor office still had to include people in training , the number of unemployed in june would have increased by almost 62,000 over the previous year . " despite the souped-up labor market statistics , in the post-war period , there have never been so many unemployed people in the month of june as in this year , " said the christian democratic union 's labor market expert , karl-josef laumann . first decrease since january the june figures represent the first decrease in germany 's unemployment rate since january .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement welcomed the statistics , saying they showed that " the trend of job loss seems to be over , " but that " a trend toward creating jobs will come only at the beginning of 2005 . " " economic growth is not yet strong enough for companies to generally start hiring more staff , " said federal labor office head , frank weise , though he added that the implementation of new labor market reforms was keeping increases in unemployment rates in check . positive growth predicted if the prognosis of one of germany 's top economic research institutes is anything to go by , the country now has reason to hope that its fledgling economic recovery will pick up speed . on tuesday , the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin predicted that the german economy would expand by more than 2 percent next year - revising upwards by half a percentage point its earlier prediction of a 1.5 percent growth rate in 2005 . however , the institute said that the additional growth would n't significantly cut the high unemployment rate . in a statement , the diw warned that the upswing was mostly the result of increased foreign demand for german products , while consumer demand at home " is still weak and will likely revive only in the later part of the forecast period of 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.07.2004 " me incorporated " boom begins to affect jobless stats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 're in the driving seat now the number of people without work in germany has slightly decreased in the past 12 months .
experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .
bergmann also has plans for expansion : " my objective is to rent an office sometime and to employ somebody else .

experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .

during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .
bergmann also has plans for expansion : " my objective is to rent an office sometime and to employ somebody else .
i have hope .
and i have made this a goal for myself .
let ’ s see what becomes of that . " dw-staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " me , inc . "
plan could be victim of its own success the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.07.2004 german jobless rate dips in june großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new figures do n't represent a real decrease in unemployment germany 's unemployment rate decreased slightly in june , though analysts say the numbers are deceptive because unemployed people on training programs no longer count towards the country 's overall jobless figures . german unemployment fell by one-tenth of a percentage point in june from may 's 10.3 percent , the federal labor office said .

unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .
" the economic cycle continues its upward trend , whereas this is having no effect whatsoever on the jobless rate . "

fished from the mediterranean two weeks ago , italy has refused to let them land .
now rome 's parliament may decide their fate . italian opposition parliamentarians are calling on interior minister giuseppe pisanu to allow the aid ship to enter the sicilian harbor empedocle to facilitate medical aid for those on board . two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said cap anamur director elias bierdel . “ we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said . while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources say that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem . “ we are a humanitarian organization .
we have a ship and we are trying to save lives .
we are very surprised to find the european union now uses gun boats to prevent us from doing that , " bierdel said . dozens of illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean from northern africa to southern europe each day – many of them die trying .
an estimated 5,000 african immigrants drowned on the sea crossing in the past year alone . " there are so many people in need and we don ’ t get the impression that the italian or spanish or greek coastguards are inclined to do anything to help them , " said bierdel . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the first wave of boat people in germany twenty-five years ago , the first vietnamese " boat people " arrived in germany after risking death in a daring flight from home .

unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.07.2004 " me incorporated " boom begins to affect jobless stats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 're in the driving seat now the number of people without work in germany has slightly decreased in the past 12 months .
experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .
bergmann also has plans for expansion : " my objective is to rent an office sometime and to employ somebody else .

plan could be victim of its own success the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme .

experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.07.2004 blair calls for an end to guantanamo prison camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friction is growing over the release of four britons from camp delta during a meeting with lawmakers on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair called the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay an " anomaly that must end " during tough questioning over his relationship with washington . british prime minister tony blair strayed from his own personal party line and openly criticized the united states ’ policy regarding the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay in cuba .
addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

now an obscure upstart cola from eastern germany is hoping to crack coke 's home market .
but will score cola make it big in america ? coke or pepsi ?
that 's the usual choice for cola lovers in the united states .
but the lichtenauer mineralquellen beverage company from the eastern german state of saxony wants to see to it that americans in future will have a third drink on their lips when it comes to the all-important cola question . ralf sippel , the company 's head of marketing , chose new york 's summer fancy food show to bring score cola to america 's shores .
the food trade fair often serves as an important venue to introduce specialty products . " it ’ s daring , it ’ s risky , but that ’ s the way we are !
we ’ re from eastern germany , where we are the market leader for mineral water and healthy drinks , " said sippel .
" we want the world - that ’ s why we have come to new york .
and the feedback we ’ ve had so far has shown us that we can hold our own . " what makes lichtenauer so confident that it can succeed where so many other cola brands have failed ?
sippel believes there 's enough room in the american market for another niche product that appeals to more health-conscious consumers .
that 's because score cola has less sugar than normal drinks , but does n't skimp on taste like diet colas . soft drinks all day " it 's a market for soft drinks .
most people drink them all day .
and that means there is here especially a need to do something about all the sugar , " sippel said , adding on one hand people are really interested in healthy food , but on the other they find it 's too difficult to do anything about it .
" so i think if those health freaks don ’ t have to count every individual calorie and additive , then we ’ ve found the right balance . " besides marketing the healthier aspect of the reduced sugar content , lichtenauer hopes to take advantage of the growing fragmentation of the u.s. beverage market and the trend towards more niche products such as energy drinks .
sippel , however , is aware that his adventurous foray in america is n't likely to turn into his main market overnight .
first they 'll have to find a u.s. distributor . " as a german exotic we can play the role of a pioneer here .
and maybe that will be enough to get us noticed , " he said . and going by the opinions of visitors to the food fair , coke and pepsi may have to start watching their backs . " i try not to drink so much cola - that was the only way to lose weight , " a man at the score cola stand told german ard television .

just over 4.2 million people were registered jobless - 60,000 less than in the previous month , and 25,300 less compared with a year ago . however , experts say the slight decrease is misleading because the number of participants taking part in training schemes no longer count towards the number of unemployed .
if the labor office still had to include people in training , the number of unemployed in june would have increased by almost 62,000 over the previous year . " despite the souped-up labor market statistics , in the post-war period , there have never been so many unemployed people in the month of june as in this year , " said the christian democratic union 's labor market expert , karl-josef laumann . first decrease since january the june figures represent the first decrease in germany 's unemployment rate since january .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement welcomed the statistics , saying they showed that " the trend of job loss seems to be over , " but that " a trend toward creating jobs will come only at the beginning of 2005 . " " economic growth is not yet strong enough for companies to generally start hiring more staff , " said federal labor office head , frank weise , though he added that the implementation of new labor market reforms was keeping increases in unemployment rates in check . positive growth predicted if the prognosis of one of germany 's top economic research institutes is anything to go by , the country now has reason to hope that its fledgling economic recovery will pick up speed . on tuesday , the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin predicted that the german economy would expand by more than 2 percent next year - revising upwards by half a percentage point its earlier prediction of a 1.5 percent growth rate in 2005 . however , the institute said that the additional growth would n't significantly cut the high unemployment rate . in a statement , the diw warned that the upswing was mostly the result of increased foreign demand for german products , while consumer demand at home " is still weak and will likely revive only in the later part of the forecast period of 2005 .

just over 4.2 million people were registered jobless - 60,000 less than in the previous month , and 25,300 less compared with a year ago . however , experts say the slight decrease is misleading because the number of participants taking part in training schemes no longer count towards the number of unemployed .
if the labor office still had to include people in training , the number of unemployed in june would have increased by almost 62,000 over the previous year . " despite the souped-up labor market statistics , in the post-war period , there have never been so many unemployed people in the month of june as in this year , " said the christian democratic union 's labor market expert , karl-josef laumann . first decrease since january the june figures represent the first decrease in germany 's unemployment rate since january .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement welcomed the statistics , saying they showed that " the trend of job loss seems to be over , " but that " a trend toward creating jobs will come only at the beginning of 2005 . " " economic growth is not yet strong enough for companies to generally start hiring more staff , " said federal labor office head , frank weise , though he added that the implementation of new labor market reforms was keeping increases in unemployment rates in check . positive growth predicted if the prognosis of one of germany 's top economic research institutes is anything to go by , the country now has reason to hope that its fledgling economic recovery will pick up speed . on tuesday , the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin predicted that the german economy would expand by more than 2 percent next year - revising upwards by half a percentage point its earlier prediction of a 1.5 percent growth rate in 2005 . however , the institute said that the additional growth would n't significantly cut the high unemployment rate . in a statement , the diw warned that the upswing was mostly the result of increased foreign demand for german products , while consumer demand at home " is still weak and will likely revive only in the later part of the forecast period of 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.07.2004 german press review : the job market limps along the long-awaited and forever promised economic revival in germany is a major topic in the nation ’ s newspapers this wednesday .
unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .
" the economic cycle continues its upward trend , whereas this is having no effect whatsoever on the jobless rate . "
the paper added that " even the latest figures provide little hope : a reversal of the economic trend is still not in sight . "
the paper 's editors concluded that germans need to concentrate on producing and providing more innovative and high-quality goods and services , which is the key to prosperity . dw-radio send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

now an obscure upstart cola from eastern germany is hoping to crack coke 's home market .
but will score cola make it big in america ? coke or pepsi ?
that 's the usual choice for cola lovers in the united states .
but the lichtenauer mineralquellen beverage company from the eastern german state of saxony wants to see to it that americans in future will have a third drink on their lips when it comes to the all-important cola question . ralf sippel , the company 's head of marketing , chose new york 's summer fancy food show to bring score cola to america 's shores .
the food trade fair often serves as an important venue to introduce specialty products . " it ’ s daring , it ’ s risky , but that ’ s the way we are !
we ’ re from eastern germany , where we are the market leader for mineral water and healthy drinks , " said sippel .
" we want the world - that ’ s why we have come to new york .
and the feedback we ’ ve had so far has shown us that we can hold our own . " what makes lichtenauer so confident that it can succeed where so many other cola brands have failed ?
sippel believes there 's enough room in the american market for another niche product that appeals to more health-conscious consumers .
that 's because score cola has less sugar than normal drinks , but does n't skimp on taste like diet colas . soft drinks all day " it 's a market for soft drinks .
most people drink them all day .
and that means there is here especially a need to do something about all the sugar , " sippel said , adding on one hand people are really interested in healthy food , but on the other they find it 's too difficult to do anything about it .
" so i think if those health freaks don ’ t have to count every individual calorie and additive , then we ’ ve found the right balance . " besides marketing the healthier aspect of the reduced sugar content , lichtenauer hopes to take advantage of the growing fragmentation of the u.s. beverage market and the trend towards more niche products such as energy drinks .
sippel , however , is aware that his adventurous foray in america is n't likely to turn into his main market overnight .
first they 'll have to find a u.s. distributor . " as a german exotic we can play the role of a pioneer here .
and maybe that will be enough to get us noticed , " he said . and going by the opinions of visitors to the food fair , coke and pepsi may have to start watching their backs . " i try not to drink so much cola - that was the only way to lose weight , " a man at the score cola stand told german ard television .
he liked score 's strategy of less sugar , but all the taste , too .
" cola without the artificial sweeteners just tastes better . " dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

just over 4.2 million people were registered jobless - 60,000 less than in the previous month , and 25,300 less compared with a year ago . however , experts say the slight decrease is misleading because the number of participants taking part in training schemes no longer count towards the number of unemployed .
if the labor office still had to include people in training , the number of unemployed in june would have increased by almost 62,000 over the previous year .

just over 4.2 million people were registered jobless - 60,000 less than in the previous month , and 25,300 less compared with a year ago . however , experts say the slight decrease is misleading because the number of participants taking part in training schemes no longer count towards the number of unemployed .
if the labor office still had to include people in training , the number of unemployed in june would have increased by almost 62,000 over the previous year . " despite the souped-up labor market statistics , in the post-war period , there have never been so many unemployed people in the month of june as in this year , " said the christian democratic union 's labor market expert , karl-josef laumann . first decrease since january the june figures represent the first decrease in germany 's unemployment rate since january .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement welcomed the statistics , saying they showed that " the trend of job loss seems to be over , " but that " a trend toward creating jobs will come only at the beginning of 2005 . " " economic growth is not yet strong enough for companies to generally start hiring more staff , " said federal labor office head , frank weise , though he added that the implementation of new labor market reforms was keeping increases in unemployment rates in check . positive growth predicted if the prognosis of one of germany 's top economic research institutes is anything to go by , the country now has reason to hope that its fledgling economic recovery will pick up speed . on tuesday , the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin predicted that the german economy would expand by more than 2 percent next year - revising upwards by half a percentage point its earlier prediction of a 1.5 percent growth rate in 2005 . however , the institute said that the additional growth would n't significantly cut the high unemployment rate . in a statement , the diw warned that the upswing was mostly the result of increased foreign demand for german products , while consumer demand at home " is still weak and will likely revive only in the later part of the forecast period of 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.07.2004 blair calls for an end to guantanamo prison camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friction is growing over the release of four britons from camp delta during a meeting with lawmakers on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair called the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay an " anomaly that must end " during tough questioning over his relationship with washington . british prime minister tony blair strayed from his own personal party line and openly criticized the united states ’ policy regarding the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay in cuba .
addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .
" the economic cycle continues its upward trend , whereas this is having no effect whatsoever on the jobless rate . "
the paper added that " even the latest figures provide little hope : a reversal of the economic trend is still not in sight . "

unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "

fished from the mediterranean two weeks ago , italy has refused to let them land .

initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said cap anamur director elias bierdel . “ we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said . while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources say that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem . “ we are a humanitarian organization .
we have a ship and we are trying to save lives .
we are very surprised to find the european union now uses gun boats to prevent us from doing that , " bierdel said . dozens of illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean from northern africa to southern europe each day – many of them die trying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.07.2004 " me incorporated " boom begins to affect jobless stats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 're in the driving seat now the number of people without work in germany has slightly decreased in the past 12 months .
experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .
bergmann also has plans for expansion : " my objective is to rent an office sometime and to employ somebody else .

experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .
bergmann also has plans for expansion : " my objective is to rent an office sometime and to employ somebody else .

experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .
bergmann also has plans for expansion : " my objective is to rent an office sometime and to employ somebody else .
i have hope .
and i have made this a goal for myself .
let ’ s see what becomes of that . " dw-staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " me , inc . "
plan could be victim of its own success the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme .
-lrb- december 8 , 2003 -rrb- german jobless rate dips in june germany 's unemployment rate decreased slightly in june , though analysts say the numbers are deceptive because unemployed people on training programs no longer count towards the country 's overall jobless figures .

now an obscure upstart cola from eastern germany is hoping to crack coke 's home market .
but will score cola make it big in america ? coke or pepsi ?
that 's the usual choice for cola lovers in the united states .
but the lichtenauer mineralquellen beverage company from the eastern german state of saxony wants to see to it that americans in future will have a third drink on their lips when it comes to the all-important cola question . ralf sippel , the company 's head of marketing , chose new york 's summer fancy food show to bring score cola to america 's shores .
the food trade fair often serves as an important venue to introduce specialty products . " it ’ s daring , it ’ s risky , but that ’ s the way we are !
we ’ re from eastern germany , where we are the market leader for mineral water and healthy drinks , " said sippel .
" we want the world - that ’ s why we have come to new york .
and the feedback we ’ ve had so far has shown us that we can hold our own . " what makes lichtenauer so confident that it can succeed where so many other cola brands have failed ?
sippel believes there 's enough room in the american market for another niche product that appeals to more health-conscious consumers .
that 's because score cola has less sugar than normal drinks , but does n't skimp on taste like diet colas . soft drinks all day " it 's a market for soft drinks .
most people drink them all day .
and that means there is here especially a need to do something about all the sugar , " sippel said , adding on one hand people are really interested in healthy food , but on the other they find it 's too difficult to do anything about it .
" so i think if those health freaks don ’ t have to count every individual calorie and additive , then we ’ ve found the right balance . " besides marketing the healthier aspect of the reduced sugar content , lichtenauer hopes to take advantage of the growing fragmentation of the u.s. beverage market and the trend towards more niche products such as energy drinks .
sippel , however , is aware that his adventurous foray in america is n't likely to turn into his main market overnight .
first they 'll have to find a u.s. distributor . " as a german exotic we can play the role of a pioneer here .
and maybe that will be enough to get us noticed , " he said . and going by the opinions of visitors to the food fair , coke and pepsi may have to start watching their backs . " i try not to drink so much cola - that was the only way to lose weight , " a man at the score cola stand told german ard television .

experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .

experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .
bergmann also has plans for expansion : " my objective is to rent an office sometime and to employ somebody else .
i have hope .
and i have made this a goal for myself .

fished from the mediterranean two weeks ago , italy has refused to let them land .
now rome 's parliament may decide their fate . italian opposition parliamentarians are calling on interior minister giuseppe pisanu to allow the aid ship to enter the sicilian harbor empedocle to facilitate medical aid for those on board . two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said cap anamur director elias bierdel . “ we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said . while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources say that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem . “ we are a humanitarian organization .
we have a ship and we are trying to save lives .
we are very surprised to find the european union now uses gun boats to prevent us from doing that , " bierdel said . dozens of illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean from northern africa to southern europe each day – many of them die trying .

initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said cap anamur director elias bierdel . “ we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said . while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources say that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem . “ we are a humanitarian organization .
we have a ship and we are trying to save lives .
we are very surprised to find the european union now uses gun boats to prevent us from doing that , " bierdel said . dozens of illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean from northern africa to southern europe each day – many of them die trying .

unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .
" the economic cycle continues its upward trend , whereas this is having no effect whatsoever on the jobless rate . "
the paper added that " even the latest figures provide little hope : a reversal of the economic trend is still not in sight . "
the paper 's editors concluded that germans need to concentrate on producing and providing more innovative and high-quality goods and services , which is the key to prosperity . dw-radio send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.07.2004 blair calls for an end to guantanamo prison camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friction is growing over the release of four britons from camp delta during a meeting with lawmakers on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair called the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay an " anomaly that must end " during tough questioning over his relationship with washington . british prime minister tony blair strayed from his own personal party line and openly criticized the united states ’ policy regarding the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay in cuba .
addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .

now an obscure upstart cola from eastern germany is hoping to crack coke 's home market .
but will score cola make it big in america ? coke or pepsi ?
that 's the usual choice for cola lovers in the united states .
but the lichtenauer mineralquellen beverage company from the eastern german state of saxony wants to see to it that americans in future will have a third drink on their lips when it comes to the all-important cola question . ralf sippel , the company 's head of marketing , chose new york 's summer fancy food show to bring score cola to america 's shores .
the food trade fair often serves as an important venue to introduce specialty products . " it ’ s daring , it ’ s risky , but that ’ s the way we are !
we ’ re from eastern germany , where we are the market leader for mineral water and healthy drinks , " said sippel .
" we want the world - that ’ s why we have come to new york .
and the feedback we ’ ve had so far has shown us that we can hold our own . " what makes lichtenauer so confident that it can succeed where so many other cola brands have failed ?
sippel believes there 's enough room in the american market for another niche product that appeals to more health-conscious consumers .
that 's because score cola has less sugar than normal drinks , but does n't skimp on taste like diet colas . soft drinks all day " it 's a market for soft drinks .
most people drink them all day .
and that means there is here especially a need to do something about all the sugar , " sippel said , adding on one hand people are really interested in healthy food , but on the other they find it 's too difficult to do anything about it .
" so i think if those health freaks don ’ t have to count every individual calorie and additive , then we ’ ve found the right balance . " besides marketing the healthier aspect of the reduced sugar content , lichtenauer hopes to take advantage of the growing fragmentation of the u.s. beverage market and the trend towards more niche products such as energy drinks .
sippel , however , is aware that his adventurous foray in america is n't likely to turn into his main market overnight .
first they 'll have to find a u.s. distributor . " as a german exotic we can play the role of a pioneer here .
and maybe that will be enough to get us noticed , " he said . and going by the opinions of visitors to the food fair , coke and pepsi may have to start watching their backs . " i try not to drink so much cola - that was the only way to lose weight , " a man at the score cola stand told german ard television .
he liked score 's strategy of less sugar , but all the taste , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.07.2004 blair calls for an end to guantanamo prison camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friction is growing over the release of four britons from camp delta during a meeting with lawmakers on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair called the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay an " anomaly that must end " during tough questioning over his relationship with washington . british prime minister tony blair strayed from his own personal party line and openly criticized the united states ’ policy regarding the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay in cuba .
addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

now an obscure upstart cola from eastern germany is hoping to crack coke 's home market .
but will score cola make it big in america ? coke or pepsi ?
that 's the usual choice for cola lovers in the united states .
but the lichtenauer mineralquellen beverage company from the eastern german state of saxony wants to see to it that americans in future will have a third drink on their lips when it comes to the all-important cola question . ralf sippel , the company 's head of marketing , chose new york 's summer fancy food show to bring score cola to america 's shores .
the food trade fair often serves as an important venue to introduce specialty products . " it ’ s daring , it ’ s risky , but that ’ s the way we are !
we ’ re from eastern germany , where we are the market leader for mineral water and healthy drinks , " said sippel .
" we want the world - that ’ s why we have come to new york .
and the feedback we ’ ve had so far has shown us that we can hold our own . " what makes lichtenauer so confident that it can succeed where so many other cola brands have failed ?
sippel believes there 's enough room in the american market for another niche product that appeals to more health-conscious consumers .
that 's because score cola has less sugar than normal drinks , but does n't skimp on taste like diet colas . soft drinks all day " it 's a market for soft drinks .
most people drink them all day .
and that means there is here especially a need to do something about all the sugar , " sippel said , adding on one hand people are really interested in healthy food , but on the other they find it 's too difficult to do anything about it .
" so i think if those health freaks don ’ t have to count every individual calorie and additive , then we ’ ve found the right balance . " besides marketing the healthier aspect of the reduced sugar content , lichtenauer hopes to take advantage of the growing fragmentation of the u.s. beverage market and the trend towards more niche products such as energy drinks .
sippel , however , is aware that his adventurous foray in america is n't likely to turn into his main market overnight .
first they 'll have to find a u.s. distributor . " as a german exotic we can play the role of a pioneer here .
and maybe that will be enough to get us noticed , " he said . and going by the opinions of visitors to the food fair , coke and pepsi may have to start watching their backs . " i try not to drink so much cola - that was the only way to lose weight , " a man at the score cola stand told german ard television .
he liked score 's strategy of less sugar , but all the taste , too .
" cola without the artificial sweeteners just tastes better . " dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

just over 4.2 million people were registered jobless - 60,000 less than in the previous month , and 25,300 less compared with a year ago . however , experts say the slight decrease is misleading because the number of participants taking part in training schemes no longer count towards the number of unemployed .
if the labor office still had to include people in training , the number of unemployed in june would have increased by almost 62,000 over the previous year . " despite the souped-up labor market statistics , in the post-war period , there have never been so many unemployed people in the month of june as in this year , " said the christian democratic union 's labor market expert , karl-josef laumann . first decrease since january the june figures represent the first decrease in germany 's unemployment rate since january .
economics and labor minister wolfgang clement welcomed the statistics , saying they showed that " the trend of job loss seems to be over , " but that " a trend toward creating jobs will come only at the beginning of 2005 . " " economic growth is not yet strong enough for companies to generally start hiring more staff , " said federal labor office head , frank weise , though he added that the implementation of new labor market reforms was keeping increases in unemployment rates in check . positive growth predicted if the prognosis of one of germany 's top economic research institutes is anything to go by , the country now has reason to hope that its fledgling economic recovery will pick up speed . on tuesday , the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin predicted that the german economy would expand by more than 2 percent next year - revising upwards by half a percentage point its earlier prediction of a 1.5 percent growth rate in 2005 . however , the institute said that the additional growth would n't significantly cut the high unemployment rate . in a statement , the diw warned that the upswing was mostly the result of increased foreign demand for german products , while consumer demand at home " is still weak and will likely revive only in the later part of the forecast period of 2005 .

now an obscure upstart cola from eastern germany is hoping to crack coke 's home market .
but will score cola make it big in america ? coke or pepsi ?
that 's the usual choice for cola lovers in the united states .
but the lichtenauer mineralquellen beverage company from the eastern german state of saxony wants to see to it that americans in future will have a third drink on their lips when it comes to the all-important cola question . ralf sippel , the company 's head of marketing , chose new york 's summer fancy food show to bring score cola to america 's shores .
the food trade fair often serves as an important venue to introduce specialty products . " it ’ s daring , it ’ s risky , but that ’ s the way we are !
we ’ re from eastern germany , where we are the market leader for mineral water and healthy drinks , " said sippel .
" we want the world - that ’ s why we have come to new york .

that 's because score cola has less sugar than normal drinks , but does n't skimp on taste like diet colas . soft drinks all day " it 's a market for soft drinks .
most people drink them all day .
and that means there is here especially a need to do something about all the sugar , " sippel said , adding on one hand people are really interested in healthy food , but on the other they find it 's too difficult to do anything about it .
" so i think if those health freaks don ’ t have to count every individual calorie and additive , then we ’ ve found the right balance . " besides marketing the healthier aspect of the reduced sugar content , lichtenauer hopes to take advantage of the growing fragmentation of the u.s. beverage market and the trend towards more niche products such as energy drinks .
sippel , however , is aware that his adventurous foray in america is n't likely to turn into his main market overnight .
first they 'll have to find a u.s. distributor . " as a german exotic we can play the role of a pioneer here .
and maybe that will be enough to get us noticed , " he said . and going by the opinions of visitors to the food fair , coke and pepsi may have to start watching their backs . " i try not to drink so much cola - that was the only way to lose weight , " a man at the score cola stand told german ard television .

experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .

experts believe this is due to more and more people taking advantage of the opportunity to become self-employed . in june , the number of unemployed people in germany fell by 25,000 , year on year , to about 4.2 million .
the reason ? germans have apparently become more independent in the work sector again – which is for many the only alternative in times of such high unemployment .
this means more people are taking the initiative to find a job where there was none or to become part of a company where there was n't any before .
in a nutshell , germany is building itself a growing self-employed industry sector .
the number of smaller enterprises coming into being has been increasing steadily since 1998 .
the pioneers of this upturn are the so-called " ich ag " entrepreneurs ; the unemployed people who , with governmental support , became part of the " me incorporated " boom now making an impact on the jobless figures .
peggy rittmüller was one of the first to take advantage of the support the german government offered to those wanting to start their own business .
" from a personal point of view , it is , of course , better .
now i can do really what i like and i can present my ideas , " she told dw-world .
" from the financial point of view , it ’ s not so pleasant at the moment .
as my husband said recently : you have not really had an income for the last 12 months , " she added .
rittmüller has been running her nutritionist practice for one year now .
after she lost her job as a nurse , striking it out on her own was the only alternative .
she has never regretted taking the leap of faith but the 39-year-old believes that without external help , she may not have made it at all .
a tough life at first rittmüller would not have her life any other way at the moment but accepts that the first tentative steps of self-employment are hard until the rewards begin to show . "
if i was not married , i would have already starved .
but the thing is , i am married .
i have somebody who can support me financially , put a roof over my head and will pay for food . "
cornelia bergmann talked of a similar situation .
for years she worked in the office of a hardware enterprise - until downsizing cost the berlin-based clerk her job .
after endless applications resulted in nothing , the mother of two decided she didn ’ t just want to be a housewife , and last year joined the ranks of the " ich ag " boom .
now the 41-year-old works from home , helping others with their tax returns .
" the first six months were very sluggish , actually .
it was very hard to get work .
nevertheless , in the course of this year , i ’ ve had more interest .
i can already say that the number of customers has increased .
i had just three customers in the first year .
and this was of course very difficult .
i think that if it had stayed like that , i would be sweating about it now . "
trade registrations on the rise the number of registrations for business status recorded in the first three months of this year was 11,500 in berlin alone , an increase of 15 percent on the same period in 2003 .
in germany , the total number of trade registrations last year rose about 10 percent to 810,000 in total .
experts see a reason for this boom in the state financed business subsidies .
everybody who can claim unemployment benefit can apply to become an " ich ag . "
however , the subsidy can not guarantee a successful enterprise , says sasha monath , a consultant for the self-employed .
no easy way out " those who want to be independent and have the purpose and the desire to work - they must go for it .
during the first three years , they will work twice as much as in the salaried world and at the same time , they will earn half as much and have a third of the vacation , " says monath .
" but for those who really want to do it , the subsidy is really useful .
but there is also a danger for those who do it because they see no other alternative .
not everybody who sets up an " ich ag " self-employed enterprise will still be independent in two years . "
the most important aspect for the sustained success of the enterprise must always be the commercial idea , says monath .
next , they must be aware that this step involves an above-average amount of involvement with the project .
those willing to attempt this must be aware that they will have to change their ideas about the working world .
" you must have a lot of discipline .
nobody does the work for you .
nobody tells you what you have to pay attention to .
if they must be in the office at six o 'clock in the morning and go home at 12 o 'clock at night then that ’ s how it must be .
as a self-employed person , you yourself are constantly responsible for the turnover of your company and the satisfaction of your customer . "
independence brings hope for peggy rittmüller and cornelia bergmann this is the reality of their everyday lives .
both want to continue with their businesses - even if they can not be sure at the moment if it will ultimately be the right choice .
despite this , they still have a lot of plans for the future .
" my wish and dream is to get the store here really running smoothly or to move maybe to another location .
and my completely biggest wish is of course to open a second one , " says rittmüller .
bergmann also has plans for expansion : " my objective is to rent an office sometime and to employ somebody else .
i have hope .
and i have made this a goal for myself .

fished from the mediterranean two weeks ago , italy has refused to let them land .
now rome 's parliament may decide their fate . italian opposition parliamentarians are calling on interior minister giuseppe pisanu to allow the aid ship to enter the sicilian harbor empedocle to facilitate medical aid for those on board . two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .

fished from the mediterranean two weeks ago , italy has refused to let them land .
now rome 's parliament may decide their fate . italian opposition parliamentarians are calling on interior minister giuseppe pisanu to allow the aid ship to enter the sicilian harbor empedocle to facilitate medical aid for those on board . two weeks ago the 37 sudanese refugees were plucked from the sea off the coast of malta .
the german ship then set sail for the closest harbor - on the southern italian island of sicily .
initially the crew believed there would not be a problem , said cap anamur director elias bierdel . “ we did everything according to the book , asking for entry into the harbor and initially we got the go ahead .
but when we arrived we were held up by gun boats and helicopters .
i felt reminded of a maritime battle , " bierdel said . while the german aid organization claims that no reason was given for the authorities ' change of heart , italian sources say that the information on the identity of the refugees was insufficient .
cap anamur has deplored the delay , saying that the ship could be rescuing other people instead of waiting for the resolution of this particular problem . “ we are a humanitarian organization .
we have a ship and we are trying to save lives .
we are very surprised to find the european union now uses gun boats to prevent us from doing that , " bierdel said . dozens of illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean from northern africa to southern europe each day – many of them die trying .

unfortunately , most editors conclude , modest growth is n't enough to create new jobs . german unemployment fell unexpectedly in june in a move that the country 's economics minister said suggested companies had stopped laying off workers .
the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .
" the economic cycle continues its upward trend , whereas this is having no effect whatsoever on the jobless rate . "
the paper added that " even the latest figures provide little hope : a reversal of the economic trend is still not in sight . "
the paper 's editors concluded that germans need to concentrate on producing and providing more innovative and high-quality goods and services , which is the key to prosperity . dw-radio send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the number out of work fell by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.37 million , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 10.5 percent .
economics minister wolfgang clement said he did not expect any discernible pick-up in the labor market until the first half of next year .
as regards any upcoming upswing in the state of economic affairs in germany , the leipziger volkszeitung questioned : " is it coming or not , the longed for rebound ? "
the paper said the good news was that we ’ ve already hit rock bottom , but the bad news is that any recovery is going to be a drawn-out and painful process .
" the weight around our necks , " according to the newspaper , " is unemployment . "
however , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung claimed that this minimal improvement was simply not enough to trigger a cyclical increase .
the berliner morgenpost wrote : " we ’ ve waited long enough for the promised upturn , and now it ’ s really meant to come ? "
meanwhile , the berliner zeitung claimed that , " the economic pick-up is still too weak to help provide for a revival of the labor market . "
according to the paper , " economists say that growth of at least two percent or even three percent is needed in order to create new jobs . "
it went on to say that consumer confidence is what ’ s needed to turn things around .
the mass-circulation bild newspaper wrote that a successful reform package is going to be the only thing that gets germans buying again .
and only further reforms are going to encourage investors to create more jobs for germany .
the märkische allgemeine reminded its readers that german economics minister wolfgang clement said a year ago that the coalition ’ s reforms would start having their effect on the labor market .
the newspaper wrote : " the only thing that has worked is the change in the way the jobless figure is calculated , hiding the fact that unemployment has increased every month since january . "
the nürnberger nachrichten put the blame on the trade unions .
it said , " they fought for a reduction in the working week for years , and yet now the experts say that the 35-hour week hasn ’ t boosted employment at all .
on the contrary , it has meant an even further deepening of the abyss that the german labor market has fallen into . "
" it ’ s frustrating , " the neue osnabrücker zeitung wrote .
" the economic cycle continues its upward trend , whereas this is having no effect whatsoever on the jobless rate . "
the paper added that " even the latest figures provide little hope : a reversal of the economic trend is still not in sight . "
the paper 's editors concluded that germans need to concentrate on producing and providing more innovative and high-quality goods and services , which is the key to prosperity . dw-radio send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.07.2004 blair calls for an end to guantanamo prison camp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friction is growing over the release of four britons from camp delta during a meeting with lawmakers on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair called the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay an " anomaly that must end " during tough questioning over his relationship with washington . british prime minister tony blair strayed from his own personal party line and openly criticized the united states ’ policy regarding the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay in cuba .
addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

addressing a committee of legislators on tuesday , blair called the camp " an anomaly that at some point has got to be brought to an end . "
friction is growing between downing street and the white house over the detention of four britons at the prison camp where international terror suspects are being held under the title of " enemy combatants " in the war on terror .
many have been denied counsel and have had no formal charges brought against them .
the prime minister confirmed to the house of commons liaison committee that he had personally asked u.s. president george w. bush to free the four remaining british suspects detained in the camp .
five other britons who spent up to two years in u.s. custody at the base were released to british officials in march , and were soon freed without charge .
however , blair said that washington continued to insist that the british government must guarantee the men will not pose a threat , either to britain or elsewhere in the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair faced tough questions .
" the american response has been the same all the way through .
in the end , if the trial requirements do not meet our standards then they will come back , but we also need to make sure that they are not going to be a threat either to people in this country or elsewhere and that is the nature of the discussion that is taking place , " he added .
" i hope we can resolve it reasonably soon .
but i do not think the us is being unreasonable in saying we need to make sure that there is proper security in place for these people . "
committee addresses influence of bush the prime minister went onto address the speculation surrounding friction in his close relationship with president bush and the political problems the friendship has caused him on the domestic front .
" i am not daft about the politics of it .
i can see , particularly in my own political family , it is a problem from time to time , " said blair , who has faced intense criticism within his labor party over the iraq war and his alignment with the conservative u.s. administration .
" i do n't think this country should ever let itself be ashamed of its relationship with the united states of america or believe that britain is america 's poodle . "
questions raised over fairness of partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the committee expressed concerns over whether blair goes too far to meet bush .
fearing britain is now bogged down in a guerrilla war in iraq over which it has no control , several lawmakers have called on blair to distance himself from the bush administration , or at least demonstrate the influence he claims to have in washington .
question marks remain over whether blair is getting a raw deal from the transatlantic relationship , a point examined by members of the committee .
" surely we , the country , have a right to know , where we have gone to war , where you have put yourself shoulder to shoulder with the americans ... what are we getting in return ? " asked conservative lawmaker edward leigh .
" has n't he let you down ?
has he delivered his side of the bargain to you , given all the political capital you have expended in his behalf ? "
leigh continued , referring to blair 's slump in opinion polls since the war .
blair responded by denying it was a " quid pro quo " relationship in which " every so often they throw us a scrap . "
in last months local and european elections , blair ’ s labor party suffered humiliating defeats across the board as the nation used the first major poll since the invasion of iraq to show its protest at the prime minister ’ s decision to go to war .
opinion polls also show a majority of britons dislike the u.s. president and disapprove of blair 's close relationship with him .
wmd admission not one of error the prime minister also admitted that weapons of mass destruction may never be found in iraq .
while not conceding that this meant there were none in the first place , it was the closest blair had come to an admittance of error on the case for going to war .
' ' we know saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction , but we know we have n't found them .
i have to accept we have not found them , that we may not find them .
they could have been removed , they could have been hidden , they could have been destroyed .
but i do not believe there was not a threat in relation to weapons of mass destruction . "
european newspapers seized on blair 's comments .
germany 's berliner zeitung saw the admission as " no more than a tactical move " and argued that blair had " made a fool of himself " by repeatedly claiming that sooner or later something would be found .
meanwhile le temps in switzerland wrote : " with a simple sentence , tony blair started a verbal retreat which he hopes will draw a line under the stumbling block that iraq has become ... and will enable him to tackle a long run-up to elections free from such a hindrance .

the us commerce department said that the move is needed because producers in vietnam and china are selling shrimp at less than market prices .
shrimp imports from china will now face duties of up to 112 % .
the vietnam association of seafood exporters and producers -lrb- vasep -rrb- said that decision was " unjust " and that it would fight " until the end " .
the organisation added that the tariffs " will have an adverse impact on the livelihood of millions of shrimp farmers in the coastal areas and thousands of workers in the shrimp processing factories in vietnam " .
china has yet to comment on the ruling .
economic staple vietnam will be particularly hit by the tariffs , as shrimp is the nation 's third biggest export item and the industry employs two million people .
vasep said that almost two thirds of vietnam 's shrimp exports will be affected by the us tariff increase .
both vietnam and china have said their shrimp industries are simply more efficient than rival producers in the us .
the us shrimp organisation southern shrimp alliance sees things differently .
it filed an anti-dumping petition last december , claiming that cheap imports had cut the value of the us shrimp harvest to $ 550m in 2002 from $ 1.25bn in 2000 .
the trade body had requested tariffs of up to 200 % .
southern shrimp alliance president eddie gordon praised the decisions as " a critical step on the road to recovery for tens of thousands of fishermen , farmers and processors devastated by the massive volume of dumped chinese and vietnamese shrimp . "
the us industry " is fighting for survival and on the brink of extinction from the tidal wave of dumped foreign shrimp " , mr gordon said .
more to come ?
asian seafood farmers , meanwhile , accuse the us of blatant protectionism .
last year vietnam lost a bitterly fought campaign against a similar tariffs move by us catfish producers .
officials at the commerce department have yet to give their judgement on four other countries named in the initial southern shrimp alliance complaint - thailand , india , brazil and ecuador .
for these the commerce department has said it will make a preliminary ruling by the end of july .
analysts say the duties against china and vietnam are likely to be enforced because the two countries are classified as " non-market economy " by the us .
by contrast they say it is much less certain whether the other four countries will be found against , as the us officially sees them as market economies .

but the government ruled there was not a strong enough case for a full dual carriageway .
northumberland county council 's executive member for highways mick scullion said : " up until now much of the debate has focused on safety .
" while this is important , there are now economic arguments that will help build an even stronger case to the government .
" we have said before that good road links are vital for a thriving north east and scottish economy .
" the scottish executive sees the a1 as vital in establishing good links between scotland and the rest of the uk .
" this adds more weight to what we have campaigned for .

proposals to dual the route , one of the country 's worst bottlenecks , are being considered by the government .
it had been suggested that the sale and expansion of exeter airport , which is alongside the route , would favour it over the alternative of dualling the a358 to the m5 .
but that has been dismissed by taunton mp adrian flook .
he is in favour of dualling the a358 instead , and says people in dorset and somerset would be more interested in using bristol airport than exeter .
he also says the a30 / a303 expansion through the blackdown hills area of outstanding natural beauty -lrb- aonb -rrb- may help some parts of devon , but is incredibly environmentally damaging .
click here for map he said : " the government as far as i am aware are not proposing exeter airport for expansion and if they are proposing that it is many years away and well beyond the remit of anyone to look at planning requirements regarding the a303 against the a358 . "
the a30 / a303 dualling scheme , which would cost £ 337.9m , is shorter than dualling the a358 and is favoured by devon county council and the south west regional assembly .
the county council has calculated that vehicles travelling via the a358 and m5 would cover an extra 32.8m miles a year .
but friends of the earth say that an increase in carbon dioxide emissions is a price worth paying to protect the ancient landscape of the blackdown hills .
devon county council decided last week to sell at least three quarters of its shares in exeter airport because it could not raise the funds needed to invest in a planned new terminal building .
the devon and cornwall business council says if the new buyer goes ahead with those plans , the government could favour dualling the a30 and a303 .
however , department for transport guidelines include a " strong presumption " against routes that would damage such areas .

the a30 / a303 dualling scheme , which would cost £ 337.9m , is shorter than dualling the a358 and is favoured by devon county council and the south west regional assembly .
the county council has calculated that vehicles travelling via the a358 and m5 would cover an extra 32.8m miles a year .
but friends of the earth say that an increase in carbon dioxide emissions is a price worth paying to protect the ancient landscape of the blackdown hills .
devon county council decided last week to sell at least three quarters of its shares in exeter airport because it could not raise the funds needed to invest in a planned new terminal building .
the devon and cornwall business council says if the new buyer goes ahead with those plans , the government could favour dualling the a30 and a303 .
however , department for transport guidelines include a " strong presumption " against routes that would damage such areas .

this is the current structure .
the funding of education is routinely described in terms such as " fiendishly complex " .
this is a simplified outline .
the resources come in three main parts : formula funding and the standards fund , which go via local education authorities -lrb- leas -rrb- , and direct grants to schools , confusingly called the school standards grant - and which actually goes via leas as well except that they are not allowed to touch it .
1 .
formula funding this is in two " blocks " : for schools , and for leas for their centrally-run activities .
how the schools block is calculated there is a basic amount per pupil across the country - except that it varies depending on children 's age groups .
the government has promised that each school get at least 4 % more for 2004-05 per pupil in cash terms than it had in 2003-04 .
to this is added , first , an amount within each age group for " additional educational needs " - to deal with special needs , truancy and exclusions - multiplied by the estimated number of pupils involved , over and above a basic threshold .
for primary schools , add on a share for " sparsity " .
this is to reflect the higher cost of maintaining a larger number of small primary schools in authorities with relatively sparse populations .
there is also a separate element for " high cost pupils " - such as those in special schools , hospital schools and pupil referral units .
the totals so far are then multiplied by what is called the " area cost adjustment " .
this is about the extra costs of recruiting and keeping staff in different parts of the country .
how the education authority block is calculated education funding is not only about schools-related administration - the government is very keen on the youth service , for instance .
the funding for leas reflects this by having two strands .
in both , there are funds related to the number of children in the area - who might be at schools within the lea or outside it - and the number of pupils in its schools , some of whom might be from outside the lea .
the funds relate to various functions an lea has to perform , such as strategic management , school admissions , premises and staffing management , special needs and welfare arrangements , raising standards and pupil transport .
added to that are sums related to the numbers locally claiming income support - to reflect the additional needs of deprived areas .
then for the central functions , as with the schools ' share , there is a factor for population sparsity .
in the community and youth strand there is a sum designed to help under-performing ethnic minority groups .
totals so far are multiplied by the area cost adjustment .
finally an amount is added for fixed costs , based on the belief that every lea whatever its size needs a core staff .
adding it up the total of these two blocks of money is known as the lea 's education formula spending share .
the education secretary , charles clarke , said this would be at least 5 % more for 2004-05 than for 2003-04 .
so now the lea has its share of the total pot , partly for its own activities and partly to be passed on to schools .
2 .
standards fund the most important extra central source of income - and in 2003 , part of the row over budget shortfalls .
the fund is to raise standards - covering numerous headings such as reducing infant class sizes .
but for 2003-04 the government took some items out of this fund and put them into the formula share - the class sizes money and money for nursery education .
and - crucially - £ 335m covering four headings was removed from the fund altogether .
this used to pay for the induction of newly-qualified teachers , support for pupil " inclusion " - those with behavioural problems , for instance ; school improvement - such as the literacy and numeracy strategies - and the cost of administering the teachers ' performance pay scheme .
in response to protests , the government put back £ 800m to reverse planned cuts in standard fund grant over the next two years .
3 .
school standards grant money which the chancellor , gordon brown , said was to go direct to head teachers to spend as they wished .
the amount each school gets depends on whether it is a primary or secondary school and how many pupils it has .
where the money goes so each lea has an amount for formula funding and the standards fund as part of its overall grant from central government .
it also decides how much to raise through the local council tax .
it then decides how much of the total it is going to spend on education services and , within that , how much of the formula funding will be for pupils , via the schools block .
the local government association makes the point that many councils in fact spend more on education than they are expected to , raising the extra themselves .
ministers and local officials routinely get into arguments about how much of any increase the government intends for schools is actually passed on to them - known as " passporting " .
despite the name , part of the " schools " block - confusingly - is for lea functions as explained above .
but the rest of it is allocated to individual schools along with a share of the standards fund .
each lea has its own way of doing this .
this will not all necessarily be in one go - and another part of the row in 2003 was about how much that was due to be devolved in this way was actually allocated to individual schools and when .
the government made new regulations in 2004 to make sure that leas ' spending on their central education budgets did not rise faster than spending on schools .

one of 12 young people who won the chance to help make the programme , he describes in the final instalment of his online diary how the experience went .
read ciarnan 's diary chronologically from the start or go straight to the latest update ...
click here to see how ciarnan coped as editor april the four winning schools are selected , including ciarnan 's school , oakgrove integrated college in northern ireland .
i think i initially underestimated the scale of this programme and the people i would meet .
putting together a special edition of the bbc 's premier political programme is not going to be easy , even with help from the regular experts .
schools question time thursday , 8 july , 2004 bbc one 2235 bst schools question time this week 's panel and working alongside the heavyweights - politicians and producers alike , not to mention david dimbleby himself - is daunting to say the least .
but i wanted to get more involved in citizenship and politics at large , and this is my opportunity .
how will so many of us -lrb- 12 pupils from four different schools across the uk -rrb- - all lacking television experience , and all with our own ideas - come to a consensus for our programme ? 6 and 7 may the schools meet in birmingham to thrash out ideas for their programme , with some help from the production team .
david dimbleby , the production team , and the pupils and teachers from the other schools soon lay my fears to rest .
all are upbeat and extremely pleasant .
this is a chance which would not ordinarily be made available to young people .
and it is a personal challenge - integrating with different students from three other schools across the uk , all with so many different opinions and different backgrounds , but ultimately one objective .
the schools taking part oakgrove integrated college , northern ireland northumberland park community school , tottenham st. edward 's college , liverpool southlands high school , lancashire during the brainstorm , we are encouraged to be open with our ideas , even though it is difficult working with 12 different people and opinions .
time is pressured .
with an edition of the programme to watch being produced on thursday , we only have a few hours left in the day .
first , the panel : we think about groupings of the main political parties , plus two others , narrowing the options down to five or six possible guests in each list .
as for the format , we only have to stick loosely to the status quo and are free to introduce our own ideas .
i feel the typical question time format works the best , though perhaps with questions relating to the whole year , as this will be the last programme in the series .
although the programme is being made by young people , i think it should be applicable to everybody .
but others want a younger audience , with questions focussing more on young people 's issues than pure politics .
ciaran mcfeely , co-producer for the panel , gets to grips with technology a production company helping out makes sure everybody is given an opportunity to say what they want .
the lines of communication are kept open , with the ideas flowing well .
we all got involved for a reason , after all , so we all have things we want to express .
it works better than i thought it would , with some compromises , and we manage to find a coherent formula for the event , even if it is only an outline at this stage .
liaising over the next few weeks will be crucial to deciding on the final product .
30 june one week to go before transmission .
i am sure the programme will be an ultimate success and will act as an example of what young people can achieve .
since we met in birmingham we have been communicating by conference calls , e-mail and phone .
the pressure is certainly mounting now , as recently we have been in contact every day .
the panel has just been finalised .
i hope none of them pulls out .
although i believe the programme will be a success , there is still an element of me that worries about things going wrong we leave on tuesday .
we have to study the newspapers and be aware of possible questions .
as i am acting as editor for the programme , i will have to select the questions to be used - and i am very thankful that the real editor will be there to help .
i already know that i have got more out of this experience than i expected .
i decided to take part because of my interest in politics and citizenship , but since the trip to birmingham i have become much more interested in the media .
i have been talking with my teacher about my expectations .
although i believe the programme will be a success , there is still an element of me that worries about things going wrong - and fears the inevitable put-down : " you ca n't trust young people " .
i hope we can prove any sceptics wrong .
8 july day of transmission i never expected to be in such a position of power .
we have just finished recording the programme .
i had had some reservations about how it would actually work and thought we would n't really be given the whole programme to produce - but in fact we made all the decisions ourselves .
even though i was alongside the editor , he did n't intervene .
with three million viewers , that makes you feel out of your depth .
your comments on the programme i had been worried the questions would n't work - that the audience would n't respond or the panel would n't relate .
i had somehow to pick questions that would provide a balanced debate .
having had to change two of the panellists at the last minute i already had a taste of how things do n't necessarily run as smoothly as planned .
i had thought there would be no hiccups - but it was much more hectic than i envisaged .
deadlines lasted a matter of seconds , not hours or minutes , and working within those limits we still had to be careful not to let standards fall .
half way through the programme we also decided to change the order of the questions , to go with the direction the audience seemed to be taking the debate .
but once the programme was in full flow , i soon felt relaxed and comfortable - the hard work seemed worth it , and we were in charge .
the panel was excellent , the audience brilliant .
it was fantastic meeting boris johnson , and he and jimmy carr had me in hysterics .
the programme certainly had its own flavour : while typical in some respects , really very funny .
and i hope we have gone some way , as director general of the bbc mark thomson said , towards disproving the theory that " politics and young people do n't mix " .
schools question time challenge is a uk-wide scheme , supported by bt in association with the institute for citizenship and by the bbc , to help pupils develop their citizenship and communication skills by producing local school question time events .

schools question time thursday , 8 july , 2004 bbc one 2235 bst schools question time this week 's panel and working alongside the heavyweights - politicians and producers alike , not to mention david dimbleby himself - is daunting to say the least .
but i wanted to get more involved in citizenship and politics at large , and this is my opportunity .
how will so many of us -lrb- 12 pupils from four different schools across the uk -rrb- - all lacking television experience , and all with our own ideas - come to a consensus for our programme ? 6 and 7 may the schools meet in birmingham to thrash out ideas for their programme , with some help from the production team .
david dimbleby , the production team , and the pupils and teachers from the other schools soon lay my fears to rest .
all are upbeat and extremely pleasant .
this is a chance which would not ordinarily be made available to young people .
and it is a personal challenge - integrating with different students from three other schools across the uk , all with so many different opinions and different backgrounds , but ultimately one objective .
the schools taking part oakgrove integrated college , northern ireland northumberland park community school , tottenham st. edward 's college , liverpool southlands high school , lancashire during the brainstorm , we are encouraged to be open with our ideas , even though it is difficult working with 12 different people and opinions .
time is pressured .
with an edition of the programme to watch being produced on thursday , we only have a few hours left in the day .
first , the panel : we think about groupings of the main political parties , plus two others , narrowing the options down to five or six possible guests in each list .
as for the format , we only have to stick loosely to the status quo and are free to introduce our own ideas .
i feel the typical question time format works the best , though perhaps with questions relating to the whole year , as this will be the last programme in the series .
although the programme is being made by young people , i think it should be applicable to everybody .
but others want a younger audience , with questions focussing more on young people 's issues than pure politics .
ciaran mcfeely , co-producer for the panel , gets to grips with technology a production company helping out makes sure everybody is given an opportunity to say what they want .
the lines of communication are kept open , with the ideas flowing well .
we all got involved for a reason , after all , so we all have things we want to express .
it works better than i thought it would , with some compromises , and we manage to find a coherent formula for the event , even if it is only an outline at this stage .
liaising over the next few weeks will be crucial to deciding on the final product .
30 june one week to go before transmission .
i am sure the programme will be an ultimate success and will act as an example of what young people can achieve .
since we met in birmingham we have been communicating by conference calls , e-mail and phone .
the pressure is certainly mounting now , as recently we have been in contact every day .
the panel has just been finalised .
i hope none of them pulls out .
although i believe the programme will be a success , there is still an element of me that worries about things going wrong we leave on tuesday .
we have to study the newspapers and be aware of possible questions .
as i am acting as editor for the programme , i will have to select the questions to be used - and i am very thankful that the real editor will be there to help .
i already know that i have got more out of this experience than i expected .
i decided to take part because of my interest in politics and citizenship , but since the trip to birmingham i have become much more interested in the media .
i have been talking with my teacher about my expectations .
although i believe the programme will be a success , there is still an element of me that worries about things going wrong - and fears the inevitable put-down : " you ca n't trust young people " .
i hope we can prove any sceptics wrong .
8 july day of transmission i never expected to be in such a position of power .
we have just finished recording the programme .
i had had some reservations about how it would actually work and thought we would n't really be given the whole programme to produce - but in fact we made all the decisions ourselves .
even though i was alongside the editor , he did n't intervene .
with three million viewers , that makes you feel out of your depth .
your comments on the programme i had been worried the questions would n't work - that the audience would n't respond or the panel would n't relate .
i had somehow to pick questions that would provide a balanced debate .
having had to change two of the panellists at the last minute i already had a taste of how things do n't necessarily run as smoothly as planned .
i had thought there would be no hiccups - but it was much more hectic than i envisaged .
deadlines lasted a matter of seconds , not hours or minutes , and working within those limits we still had to be careful not to let standards fall .
half way through the programme we also decided to change the order of the questions , to go with the direction the audience seemed to be taking the debate .
but once the programme was in full flow , i soon felt relaxed and comfortable - the hard work seemed worth it , and we were in charge .
the panel was excellent , the audience brilliant .
it was fantastic meeting boris johnson , and he and jimmy carr had me in hysterics .
the programme certainly had its own flavour : while typical in some respects , really very funny .
and i hope we have gone some way , as director general of the bbc mark thomson said , towards disproving the theory that " politics and young people do n't mix " .
schools question time challenge is a uk-wide scheme , supported by bt in association with the institute for citizenship and by the bbc , to help pupils develop their citizenship and communication skills by producing local school question time events .

the local branch of the british medical association believes it is a move the island should make ahead of the uk .
in the uk , 4,500 doctors have written to prime minister tony blair demanding a complete ban on smoking in pubs , clubs and restaurants .
the bma 's dr brian parkin said he believed it was an example of where guernsey could lead rather than follow .
confined spaces " i think the board of health locally has been very good in supporting anti-social measures , " he said .
" i would like to see guernsey leaving the uk in this aspect , but i think it 's very much a matter for the board of health , as it is for the uk government .
" to be honest i am not very hopeful of the uk government doing anything , but we can maybe achieve more locally than we can in the uk . "
one guernsey restaurateur , nello ciotti , said he was supporting the ban .
