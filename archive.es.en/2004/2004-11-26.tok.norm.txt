" i am deeply convinced that we have no moral right whatsoever to push a major european state to whatever mass mayhem , " said putin , according to reuters .
" from my perspective … all claims should go to the courts . "
tens of thousands of demonstrators have occupied kiev 's main square since sunday in protest of election results that gave the presidency to russian-favored viktor yanukovych .
opposition candidate viktor yushchenko and international observers have reported widespread election fraud .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.11.2004 eu joins ukrainian crisis round table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu envoys solana , left , and kwasniewski , right , in kiev ukraine 's two rival presidential candidates met friday for the first time since the disputed weekend vote in the presence of president leonid kuchma and european and russian mediators . attempts to mediate the political crisis in ukraine gathered pace friday when several key eu envoys arrived in kiev for a high-level meeting with the principle actors in ukraine 's current political crisis : outgoing president leonid kuchma and the two rival presidential candidates , viktor yanukovych and viktor yushchenko . the arrival of eu foreign policy chief solana and polish president kwasniewski is just the latest in the increasing efforts by external officials to mediate in the crisis over the disputed weekend presidential vote . according to german public broadcaster ard , a recount of the votes has been suggested as a possible solution to the stand-off .
but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .
no one , even the supreme court , has the right to annul it , " argued yanukovych spokesman sergei tigipko . protests continue across ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections in front of the ukrainian government building in kiev .
meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten ! "
hundreds of yanukovych supporters who had gathered there earlier in the day had left , abandoning their tents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other opposition members gathered in front of the parliament and presidential administration .
" we will win !
ukrainians have never been so united , " said vladimir , 23 , who has braved the bitter cold winter weather for three days .
" we will stay in kiev until yushchenko is president , " he said , adding " we will fight only by legal means , we do n't want any violence . " teachers in the western opposition bastion city of lviv went on strike as thousands of students boycotted classes in hundreds of schools .

but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .

at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .

"
hundreds of yanukovych supporters who had gathered there earlier in the day had left , abandoning their tents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other opposition members gathered in front of the parliament and presidential administration .

but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .
no one , even the supreme court , has the right to annul it , " argued yanukovych spokesman sergei tigipko . protests continue across ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections in front of the ukrainian government building in kiev .
meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten ! "
hundreds of yanukovych supporters who had gathered there earlier in the day had left , abandoning their tents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other opposition members gathered in front of the parliament and presidential administration .

but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .
no one , even the supreme court , has the right to annul it , " argued yanukovych spokesman sergei tigipko . protests continue across ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections in front of the ukrainian government building in kiev .
meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten !

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .
the board said it now assumed that the capital increase could go ahead as planned . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle 's return to profit set back karstadtquelle , the crisis-ridden german retail giant , does not expect to turn in a profit until 2006 instead of 2005 , as expected .

" i am deeply convinced that we have no moral right whatsoever to push a major european state to whatever mass mayhem , " said putin , according to reuters .
" from my perspective … all claims should go to the courts . "
tens of thousands of demonstrators have occupied kiev 's main square since sunday in protest of election results that gave the presidency to russian-favored viktor yanukovych .
opposition candidate viktor yushchenko and international observers have reported widespread election fraud .
on thursday , yushchenko won a significant battle when ukraine 's highest court ruled against the publication of the election results .
the ruling effectively blocks yanukovych 's inauguration .
eu , us want recount the opposition candidate enjoys strong support in western europe and washington .
former polish president lech walesa traveled to the capital and appeared with yuschenko at a rally .
while eu and the united states have called for a recount , putin reiterated his support for yanukovych on thursday .

but balkenende maintained that the election results should be examined by a team of international observers .
he acknowledged that though the approach might be different , russia and europe shared a desire that the country not become consumed in a spiral of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has been on the phone with yuschenko and outgoing president leonid kuchma , who favored yanukovych , as well as with us secretary of state colin powell and a few of his european counterparts .
turning point in young history referring to putin , fischer said that everyone " must work towards a democratic and acceptable solution . "
the fact that russian and western european leaders are weighing in the election show how important ukraine is becoming as a bridge between russia and europe .
observers say the election could mark a turning point in the ex-soviet republic 's recent history .
putin , who enjoyed close relations with the controversial kuchma , came out repeatedly in favor of the outgoing president 's chosen successor .
europe and washington , on the other hand , would like to see yushchenko , an economist who has promised to lead the country in a western direction , in power .
on wednesday , european commission chief jose barroso said the future of eu-ukraine relations depended on a fair election outcome .
" there will be consequences in the overall relations between the eu and ukraine if there is not a serious , objective and balanced review of the electoral process and the electoral results , " he said .
opposition goes to court though exit polls on sunday indicated yushchenko had a lead of several percentage points over yanukovych , the official central election committee declared yanukovych the winner by a slim margin on wednesday .

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .
the board said it now assumed that the capital increase could go ahead as planned . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle 's return to profit set back karstadtquelle , the crisis-ridden german retail giant , does not expect to turn in a profit until 2006 instead of 2005 , as expected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.11.2004 eu joins ukrainian crisis round table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu envoys solana , left , and kwasniewski , right , in kiev ukraine 's two rival presidential candidates met friday for the first time since the disputed weekend vote in the presence of president leonid kuchma and european and russian mediators . attempts to mediate the political crisis in ukraine gathered pace friday when several key eu envoys arrived in kiev for a high-level meeting with the principle actors in ukraine 's current political crisis : outgoing president leonid kuchma and the two rival presidential candidates , viktor yanukovych and viktor yushchenko . the arrival of eu foreign policy chief solana and polish president kwasniewski is just the latest in the increasing efforts by external officials to mediate in the crisis over the disputed weekend presidential vote . according to german public broadcaster ard , a recount of the votes has been suggested as a possible solution to the stand-off .
but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .
no one , even the supreme court , has the right to annul it , " argued yanukovych spokesman sergei tigipko . protests continue across ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections in front of the ukrainian government building in kiev .
meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten ! "
hundreds of yanukovych supporters who had gathered there earlier in the day had left , abandoning their tents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other opposition members gathered in front of the parliament and presidential administration .
" we will win !
ukrainians have never been so united , " said vladimir , 23 , who has braved the bitter cold winter weather for three days .
" we will stay in kiev until yushchenko is president , " he said , adding " we will fight only by legal means , we do n't want any violence . " teachers in the western opposition bastion city of lviv went on strike as thousands of students boycotted classes in hundreds of schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.11.2004 eu joins ukrainian crisis round table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu envoys solana , left , and kwasniewski , right , in kiev ukraine 's two rival presidential candidates met friday for the first time since the disputed weekend vote in the presence of president leonid kuchma and european and russian mediators . attempts to mediate the political crisis in ukraine gathered pace friday when several key eu envoys arrived in kiev for a high-level meeting with the principle actors in ukraine 's current political crisis : outgoing president leonid kuchma and the two rival presidential candidates , viktor yanukovych and viktor yushchenko . the arrival of eu foreign policy chief solana and polish president kwasniewski is just the latest in the increasing efforts by external officials to mediate in the crisis over the disputed weekend presidential vote . according to german public broadcaster ard , a recount of the votes has been suggested as a possible solution to the stand-off .
but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .
no one , even the supreme court , has the right to annul it , " argued yanukovych spokesman sergei tigipko . protests continue across ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections in front of the ukrainian government building in kiev .
meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten ! "
hundreds of yanukovych supporters who had gathered there earlier in the day had left , abandoning their tents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other opposition members gathered in front of the parliament and presidential administration .
" we will win !
ukrainians have never been so united , " said vladimir , 23 , who has braved the bitter cold winter weather for three days .
" we will stay in kiev until yushchenko is president , " he said , adding " we will fight only by legal means , we do n't want any violence . " teachers in the western opposition bastion city of lviv went on strike as thousands of students boycotted classes in hundreds of schools .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .
but we live in an imperfect world , she added .
besides , men are welcome here , “ as long as they ’ re nice , ” she said . gisela essert had come to the opening reception to talk about a foundation for dyslexic children she wants to found .
she had made the rounds to banks , but since she has a background in the arts and has been self-employed for years , her financial résumé doesn ’ t fit the pattern bankers have been trained to look for before approving a loan . she said she does not expect special treatment at a women ’ s bank , besides , this idea is not about coddling women who need to be handled with kid gloves . “ this is the wrong image .
it ’ s just about giving women the right kind of support , ” she told dw-world .
“ i mean for hundreds of years men have created clubs for themselves and acquired a lot of power .
it ’ s natural , so why shouldn ’ t women do that as well ? ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for german women , glass ceiling hangs low pharmaceutical giant schering announced this week it would appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board – a sad first for germany .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .
but we live in an imperfect world , she added .
besides , men are welcome here , “ as long as they ’ re nice , ” she said . gisela essert had come to the opening reception to talk about a foundation for dyslexic children she wants to found .

other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .
but we live in an imperfect world , she added .
besides , men are welcome here , “ as long as they ’ re nice , ” she said . gisela essert had come to the opening reception to talk about a foundation for dyslexic children she wants to found .
she had made the rounds to banks , but since she has a background in the arts and has been self-employed for years , her financial résumé doesn ’ t fit the pattern bankers have been trained to look for before approving a loan . she said she does not expect special treatment at a women ’ s bank , besides , this idea is not about coddling women who need to be handled with kid gloves . “ this is the wrong image .
it ’ s just about giving women the right kind of support , ” she told dw-world .
“ i mean for hundreds of years men have created clubs for themselves and acquired a lot of power .
it ’ s natural , so why shouldn ’ t women do that as well ? ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for german women , glass ceiling hangs low pharmaceutical giant schering announced this week it would appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board – a sad first for germany .

henkel said it had decided on the basics of a new restructuring program and expected to accrue additional provision of about € 400 million -lrb- $ 530 million -rrb- for measures between 2004 and 2006 , excluding restructuring costs already planned for this year .
as a result , it anticipated € 125 million in annual savings from 2007 .
the company said the program - made necessary by increasing international competition and the cost pressure from low-wage countries - would entail 3,000 job cuts worldwide by 2006 .

that must have been the logic at signal technology rossberg , near zwickau , which designed the new pedestrian lights 31 years after the first developing the male version .
only one example of the new ladylike traffic crossing has been installed so far , at zwickau 's busy crimmitschauer / werdauer street intersection .
the lights will have to survive a three-month trial period to see how they 're received , according to city spokeswoman angelika michaelis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr traffic men have cult status across germany - why not traffic women too ?
the traffic women wo n't offer much competition to their male counterparts though , since zwickau does n't have the funds to install the pig-tailed guides throughout town .
but michaelis suggested that traffic women may gradually be phased in when lights need to be replaced .
it 's odd , that the idea did n't come up sooner , since germany 's highway codes do n't stipulate traffic symbols must take a male form .
and the green and red ladies may just prove to be an improvement .
" if these female traffic symbols attract more attention , then from a traffic safety point of view , we have been vindicated , " michaelis said . dw staff -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " and finally ... "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.11.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc european cannabis use at all time high cannabis remains the most commonly used drug in the eu with roughly one in five adult europeans having tried it at least once in their lifetime .
the 2004 annual report from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- published on thursday in brussels also shows that cannabis use has now stabilized in europe - although at historically high levels .
around 15 percent of 15-16-year-old school students in the eu who have used cannabis in the last year are described as " heavy " cannabis users - defined as using the drug 40 or more times per year .
young male students are more than twice as likely to be " heavy users " as girls , said the report .
ecstasy may be catching up or overtaking amphetamines as europe ’ s no 2 drug after cannabis .
heroin use is now relatively stable in many eu countries and the number of new users has fallen since the 1990s , while cocaine use has risen to some extent among young people in denmark , germany , spain and the uk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.11.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc european cannabis use at all time high cannabis remains the most commonly used drug in the eu with roughly one in five adult europeans having tried it at least once in their lifetime .
the 2004 annual report from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- published on thursday in brussels also shows that cannabis use has now stabilized in europe - although at historically high levels .
around 15 percent of 15-16-year-old school students in the eu who have used cannabis in the last year are described as " heavy " cannabis users - defined as using the drug 40 or more times per year .
young male students are more than twice as likely to be " heavy users " as girls , said the report .
ecstasy may be catching up or overtaking amphetamines as europe ’ s no 2 drug after cannabis .
heroin use is now relatively stable in many eu countries and the number of new users has fallen since the 1990s , while cocaine use has risen to some extent among young people in denmark , germany , spain and the uk .
overall less than 1 percent of the european adult population -lrb- 15-64 years -rrb- can be defined as problem drug-users .
drug-related deaths fell from 8,838 in 2000 to 8,306 in 2001 representing a small but significant 6 percent decrease .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.11.2004 iran backs down on uranium enrichment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's negotiator with iaea 's mohamed elbaradei after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons . on thursday , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , mohamed elbaradei , reported an impasse between the eu and iran on centrifuge devices .
just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .
the enrichment freeze was forged in talks with eu negotiators britain , france and germany in order to help tehran show good faith and avoid possible un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers visit the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade . "
he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it . " several diplomats said the iranians were merely trying to use the centrifuges as a bargaining chip to get the europeans to soften the resolution . iran maintains its nuclear program is strictly peaceful . afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues new nuclear demands the un atomic agency meets thursday to review a resolution under which iran is to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .

henkel said it had decided on the basics of a new restructuring program and expected to accrue additional provision of about € 400 million -lrb- $ 530 million -rrb- for measures between 2004 and 2006 , excluding restructuring costs already planned for this year .
as a result , it anticipated € 125 million in annual savings from 2007 .
the company said the program - made necessary by increasing international competition and the cost pressure from low-wage countries - would entail 3,000 job cuts worldwide by 2006 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.11.2004 eu joins ukrainian crisis round table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu envoys solana , left , and kwasniewski , right , in kiev ukraine 's two rival presidential candidates met friday for the first time since the disputed weekend vote in the presence of president leonid kuchma and european and russian mediators . attempts to mediate the political crisis in ukraine gathered pace friday when several key eu envoys arrived in kiev for a high-level meeting with the principle actors in ukraine 's current political crisis : outgoing president leonid kuchma and the two rival presidential candidates , viktor yanukovych and viktor yushchenko . the arrival of eu foreign policy chief solana and polish president kwasniewski is just the latest in the increasing efforts by external officials to mediate in the crisis over the disputed weekend presidential vote . according to german public broadcaster ard , a recount of the votes has been suggested as a possible solution to the stand-off .
but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .
no one , even the supreme court , has the right to annul it , " argued yanukovych spokesman sergei tigipko . protests continue across ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections in front of the ukrainian government building in kiev .
meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten ! "
hundreds of yanukovych supporters who had gathered there earlier in the day had left , abandoning their tents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other opposition members gathered in front of the parliament and presidential administration .
" we will win !
ukrainians have never been so united , " said vladimir , 23 , who has braved the bitter cold winter weather for three days .
" we will stay in kiev until yushchenko is president , " he said , adding " we will fight only by legal means , we do n't want any violence . " teachers in the western opposition bastion city of lviv went on strike as thousands of students boycotted classes in hundreds of schools .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .
but we live in an imperfect world , she added .
besides , men are welcome here , “ as long as they ’ re nice , ” she said . gisela essert had come to the opening reception to talk about a foundation for dyslexic children she wants to found .
she had made the rounds to banks , but since she has a background in the arts and has been self-employed for years , her financial résumé doesn ’ t fit the pattern bankers have been trained to look for before approving a loan . she said she does not expect special treatment at a women ’ s bank , besides , this idea is not about coddling women who need to be handled with kid gloves . “ this is the wrong image .
it ’ s just about giving women the right kind of support , ” she told dw-world .
“ i mean for hundreds of years men have created clubs for themselves and acquired a lot of power .
it ’ s natural , so why shouldn ’ t women do that as well ? ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for german women , glass ceiling hangs low pharmaceutical giant schering announced this week it would appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board – a sad first for germany .

but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .
no one , even the supreme court , has the right to annul it , " argued yanukovych spokesman sergei tigipko . protests continue across ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections in front of the ukrainian government building in kiev .
meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten ! "
hundreds of yanukovych supporters who had gathered there earlier in the day had left , abandoning their tents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other opposition members gathered in front of the parliament and presidential administration .

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .
the board said it now assumed that the capital increase could go ahead as planned . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle 's return to profit set back karstadtquelle , the crisis-ridden german retail giant , does not expect to turn in a profit until 2006 instead of 2005 , as expected .

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .

the 2004 annual report from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- published on thursday in brussels also shows that cannabis use has now stabilized in europe - although at historically high levels .
around 15 percent of 15-16-year-old school students in the eu who have used cannabis in the last year are described as " heavy " cannabis users - defined as using the drug 40 or more times per year .
young male students are more than twice as likely to be " heavy users " as girls , said the report .
ecstasy may be catching up or overtaking amphetamines as europe ’ s no 2 drug after cannabis .
heroin use is now relatively stable in many eu countries and the number of new users has fallen since the 1990s , while cocaine use has risen to some extent among young people in denmark , germany , spain and the uk .
overall less than 1 percent of the european adult population -lrb- 15-64 years -rrb- can be defined as problem drug-users .
drug-related deaths fell from 8,838 in 2000 to 8,306 in 2001 representing a small but significant 6 percent decrease .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .
but we live in an imperfect world , she added .
besides , men are welcome here , “ as long as they ’ re nice , ” she said . gisela essert had come to the opening reception to talk about a foundation for dyslexic children she wants to found .
she had made the rounds to banks , but since she has a background in the arts and has been self-employed for years , her financial résumé doesn ’ t fit the pattern bankers have been trained to look for before approving a loan . she said she does not expect special treatment at a women ’ s bank , besides , this idea is not about coddling women who need to be handled with kid gloves . “ this is the wrong image .
it ’ s just about giving women the right kind of support , ” she told dw-world .
“ i mean for hundreds of years men have created clubs for themselves and acquired a lot of power .
it ’ s natural , so why shouldn ’ t women do that as well ? ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for german women , glass ceiling hangs low pharmaceutical giant schering announced this week it would appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board – a sad first for germany .

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .

the 2004 annual report from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- published on thursday in brussels also shows that cannabis use has now stabilized in europe - although at historically high levels .
around 15 percent of 15-16-year-old school students in the eu who have used cannabis in the last year are described as " heavy " cannabis users - defined as using the drug 40 or more times per year .
young male students are more than twice as likely to be " heavy users " as girls , said the report .
ecstasy may be catching up or overtaking amphetamines as europe ’ s no 2 drug after cannabis .
heroin use is now relatively stable in many eu countries and the number of new users has fallen since the 1990s , while cocaine use has risen to some extent among young people in denmark , germany , spain and the uk .
overall less than 1 percent of the european adult population -lrb- 15-64 years -rrb- can be defined as problem drug-users .
drug-related deaths fell from 8,838 in 2000 to 8,306 in 2001 representing a small but significant 6 percent decrease .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.11.2004 iran backs down on uranium enrichment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's negotiator with iaea 's mohamed elbaradei after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons . on thursday , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , mohamed elbaradei , reported an impasse between the eu and iran on centrifuge devices .
just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .
the enrichment freeze was forged in talks with eu negotiators britain , france and germany in order to help tehran show good faith and avoid possible un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers visit the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade . "
he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it . " several diplomats said the iranians were merely trying to use the centrifuges as a bargaining chip to get the europeans to soften the resolution . iran maintains its nuclear program is strictly peaceful . afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues new nuclear demands the un atomic agency meets thursday to review a resolution under which iran is to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.11.2004 iran backs down on uranium enrichment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's negotiator with iaea 's mohamed elbaradei after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons . on thursday , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , mohamed elbaradei , reported an impasse between the eu and iran on centrifuge devices .
just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .
the enrichment freeze was forged in talks with eu negotiators britain , france and germany in order to help tehran show good faith and avoid possible un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers visit the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade . "
he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it . " several diplomats said the iranians were merely trying to use the centrifuges as a bargaining chip to get the europeans to soften the resolution . iran maintains its nuclear program is strictly peaceful . afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues new nuclear demands the un atomic agency meets thursday to review a resolution under which iran is to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
on wednesday , iran warned it would seek to resume enrichment if the meeting did not go its way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.11.2004 a bank of their own großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often feel underserved by traditional banks virginia woolf wrote that if a woman is to succeed -lrb- or write fiction -rrb- , she needs money and a room of her own .
some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .
but we live in an imperfect world , she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.11.2004 iran backs down on uranium enrichment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's negotiator with iaea 's mohamed elbaradei after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons . on thursday , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , mohamed elbaradei , reported an impasse between the eu and iran on centrifuge devices .
just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .
the enrichment freeze was forged in talks with eu negotiators britain , france and germany in order to help tehran show good faith and avoid possible un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers visit the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade . "
he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it . " several diplomats said the iranians were merely trying to use the centrifuges as a bargaining chip to get the europeans to soften the resolution . iran maintains its nuclear program is strictly peaceful . afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues new nuclear demands the un atomic agency meets thursday to review a resolution under which iran is to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.11.2004 a bank of their own großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often feel underserved by traditional banks virginia woolf wrote that if a woman is to succeed -lrb- or write fiction -rrb- , she needs money and a room of her own .
some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .
the board said it now assumed that the capital increase could go ahead as planned . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle 's return to profit set back karstadtquelle , the crisis-ridden german retail giant , does not expect to turn in a profit until 2006 instead of 2005 , as expected .

the 2004 annual report from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- published on thursday in brussels also shows that cannabis use has now stabilized in europe - although at historically high levels .
around 15 percent of 15-16-year-old school students in the eu who have used cannabis in the last year are described as " heavy " cannabis users - defined as using the drug 40 or more times per year .
young male students are more than twice as likely to be " heavy users " as girls , said the report .
ecstasy may be catching up or overtaking amphetamines as europe ’ s no 2 drug after cannabis .
heroin use is now relatively stable in many eu countries and the number of new users has fallen since the 1990s , while cocaine use has risen to some extent among young people in denmark , germany , spain and the uk .
overall less than 1 percent of the european adult population -lrb- 15-64 years -rrb- can be defined as problem drug-users .
drug-related deaths fell from 8,838 in 2000 to 8,306 in 2001 representing a small but significant 6 percent decrease .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.11.2004 iran backs down on uranium enrichment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's negotiator with iaea 's mohamed elbaradei after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons . on thursday , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , mohamed elbaradei , reported an impasse between the eu and iran on centrifuge devices .
just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .
the enrichment freeze was forged in talks with eu negotiators britain , france and germany in order to help tehran show good faith and avoid possible un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers visit the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade . "
he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it . " several diplomats said the iranians were merely trying to use the centrifuges as a bargaining chip to get the europeans to soften the resolution . iran maintains its nuclear program is strictly peaceful . afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues new nuclear demands the un atomic agency meets thursday to review a resolution under which iran is to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .

just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .

but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .
no one , even the supreme court , has the right to annul it , " argued yanukovych spokesman sergei tigipko . protests continue across ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections in front of the ukrainian government building in kiev .
meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten ! "
hundreds of yanukovych supporters who had gathered there earlier in the day had left , abandoning their tents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other opposition members gathered in front of the parliament and presidential administration .

analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .

meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten ! "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.11.2004 karstadtquelle gets the go-ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle has caught its rescuing life-buoy nothing more stands in the way of karstadtquelle 's planned capital increase .
the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .
the board said it now assumed that the capital increase could go ahead as planned . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle 's return to profit set back karstadtquelle , the crisis-ridden german retail giant , does not expect to turn in a profit until 2006 instead of 2005 , as expected .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .

that ’ s not true , ” she said .

“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .
but we live in an imperfect world , she added .
besides , men are welcome here , “ as long as they ’ re nice , ” she said . gisela essert had come to the opening reception to talk about a foundation for dyslexic children she wants to found .
she had made the rounds to banks , but since she has a background in the arts and has been self-employed for years , her financial résumé doesn ’ t fit the pattern bankers have been trained to look for before approving a loan . she said she does not expect special treatment at a women ’ s bank , besides , this idea is not about coddling women who need to be handled with kid gloves . “ this is the wrong image .
it ’ s just about giving women the right kind of support , ” she told dw-world .
“ i mean for hundreds of years men have created clubs for themselves and acquired a lot of power .
it ’ s natural , so why shouldn ’ t women do that as well ? ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for german women , glass ceiling hangs low pharmaceutical giant schering announced this week it would appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board – a sad first for germany .

" i am deeply convinced that we have no moral right whatsoever to push a major european state to whatever mass mayhem , " said putin , according to reuters .
" from my perspective … all claims should go to the courts . "
tens of thousands of demonstrators have occupied kiev 's main square since sunday in protest of election results that gave the presidency to russian-favored viktor yanukovych .
opposition candidate viktor yushchenko and international observers have reported widespread election fraud .
on thursday , yushchenko won a significant battle when ukraine 's highest court ruled against the publication of the election results .
the ruling effectively blocks yanukovych 's inauguration .
eu , us want recount the opposition candidate enjoys strong support in western europe and washington .
former polish president lech walesa traveled to the capital and appeared with yuschenko at a rally .
while eu and the united states have called for a recount , putin reiterated his support for yanukovych on thursday .

but balkenende maintained that the election results should be examined by a team of international observers .
he acknowledged that though the approach might be different , russia and europe shared a desire that the country not become consumed in a spiral of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has been on the phone with yuschenko and outgoing president leonid kuchma , who favored yanukovych , as well as with us secretary of state colin powell and a few of his european counterparts .
turning point in young history referring to putin , fischer said that everyone " must work towards a democratic and acceptable solution . "
the fact that russian and western european leaders are weighing in the election show how important ukraine is becoming as a bridge between russia and europe .
observers say the election could mark a turning point in the ex-soviet republic 's recent history .
putin , who enjoyed close relations with the controversial kuchma , came out repeatedly in favor of the outgoing president 's chosen successor .
europe and washington , on the other hand , would like to see yushchenko , an economist who has promised to lead the country in a western direction , in power .
on wednesday , european commission chief jose barroso said the future of eu-ukraine relations depended on a fair election outcome .
" there will be consequences in the overall relations between the eu and ukraine if there is not a serious , objective and balanced review of the electoral process and the electoral results , " he said .
opposition goes to court though exit polls on sunday indicated yushchenko had a lead of several percentage points over yanukovych , the official central election committee declared yanukovych the winner by a slim margin on wednesday .

yushchenko 's campaign team have already filed a complaint to ukraine 's supreme court regarding the conduct of officials overseeing the election .

just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .
the enrichment freeze was forged in talks with eu negotiators britain , france and germany in order to help tehran show good faith and avoid possible un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers visit the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade . "
he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it . " several diplomats said the iranians were merely trying to use the centrifuges as a bargaining chip to get the europeans to soften the resolution . iran maintains its nuclear program is strictly peaceful . afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues new nuclear demands the un atomic agency meets thursday to review a resolution under which iran is to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .

but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .
no one , even the supreme court , has the right to annul it , " argued yanukovych spokesman sergei tigipko . protests continue across ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections in front of the ukrainian government building in kiev .
meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten ! "
hundreds of yanukovych supporters who had gathered there earlier in the day had left , abandoning their tents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other opposition members gathered in front of the parliament and presidential administration .
" we will win !
ukrainians have never been so united , " said vladimir , 23 , who has braved the bitter cold winter weather for three days .
" we will stay in kiev until yushchenko is president , " he said , adding " we will fight only by legal means , we do n't want any violence . " teachers in the western opposition bastion city of lviv went on strike as thousands of students boycotted classes in hundreds of schools .

just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .
the enrichment freeze was forged in talks with eu negotiators britain , france and germany in order to help tehran show good faith and avoid possible un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers visit the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade . "
he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it . " several diplomats said the iranians were merely trying to use the centrifuges as a bargaining chip to get the europeans to soften the resolution . iran maintains its nuclear program is strictly peaceful . afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues new nuclear demands the un atomic agency meets thursday to review a resolution under which iran is to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .

that must have been the logic at signal technology rossberg , near zwickau , which designed the new pedestrian lights 31 years after the first developing the male version .
only one example of the new ladylike traffic crossing has been installed so far , at zwickau 's busy crimmitschauer / werdauer street intersection .
the lights will have to survive a three-month trial period to see how they 're received , according to city spokeswoman angelika michaelis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr traffic men have cult status across germany - why not traffic women too ?
the traffic women wo n't offer much competition to their male counterparts though , since zwickau does n't have the funds to install the pig-tailed guides throughout town .
but michaelis suggested that traffic women may gradually be phased in when lights need to be replaced .
it 's odd , that the idea did n't come up sooner , since germany 's highway codes do n't stipulate traffic symbols must take a male form .
and the green and red ladies may just prove to be an improvement .
" if these female traffic symbols attract more attention , then from a traffic safety point of view , we have been vindicated , " michaelis said . dw staff -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " and finally ... "

" i am deeply convinced that we have no moral right whatsoever to push a major european state to whatever mass mayhem , " said putin , according to reuters .
" from my perspective … all claims should go to the courts . "
tens of thousands of demonstrators have occupied kiev 's main square since sunday in protest of election results that gave the presidency to russian-favored viktor yanukovych .
opposition candidate viktor yushchenko and international observers have reported widespread election fraud .
on thursday , yushchenko won a significant battle when ukraine 's highest court ruled against the publication of the election results .
the ruling effectively blocks yanukovych 's inauguration .
eu , us want recount the opposition candidate enjoys strong support in western europe and washington .
former polish president lech walesa traveled to the capital and appeared with yuschenko at a rally .
while eu and the united states have called for a recount , putin reiterated his support for yanukovych on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the russian federation vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " both eu and russia are keen to see a stable , democratic country … and therefore we need to ensure that what is done reflects the will of the voters , " said dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country is holding the rotating presidency of the eu , following the meeting with putin .
but balkenende maintained that the election results should be examined by a team of international observers .
he acknowledged that though the approach might be different , russia and europe shared a desire that the country not become consumed in a spiral of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has been on the phone with yuschenko and outgoing president leonid kuchma , who favored yanukovych , as well as with us secretary of state colin powell and a few of his european counterparts .
turning point in young history referring to putin , fischer said that everyone " must work towards a democratic and acceptable solution . "
the fact that russian and western european leaders are weighing in the election show how important ukraine is becoming as a bridge between russia and europe .
observers say the election could mark a turning point in the ex-soviet republic 's recent history .
putin , who enjoyed close relations with the controversial kuchma , came out repeatedly in favor of the outgoing president 's chosen successor .
europe and washington , on the other hand , would like to see yushchenko , an economist who has promised to lead the country in a western direction , in power .
on wednesday , european commission chief jose barroso said the future of eu-ukraine relations depended on a fair election outcome .
" there will be consequences in the overall relations between the eu and ukraine if there is not a serious , objective and balanced review of the electoral process and the electoral results , " he said .
opposition goes to court though exit polls on sunday indicated yushchenko had a lead of several percentage points over yanukovych , the official central election committee declared yanukovych the winner by a slim margin on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers guard the ukrainian presidential administration building in kiev yushchenko immediately protested as his supporters set up a tent city in front of rows and rows of riot police .
in the freezing cold and snow , they put flowers in the shields of the officers and called for change .
yushchenko 's campaign team have already filed a complaint to ukraine 's supreme court regarding the conduct of officials overseeing the election .

" from my perspective … all claims should go to the courts . "
tens of thousands of demonstrators have occupied kiev 's main square since sunday in protest of election results that gave the presidency to russian-favored viktor yanukovych .
opposition candidate viktor yushchenko and international observers have reported widespread election fraud .
on thursday , yushchenko won a significant battle when ukraine 's highest court ruled against the publication of the election results .
the ruling effectively blocks yanukovych 's inauguration .
eu , us want recount the opposition candidate enjoys strong support in western europe and washington .

putin , who enjoyed close relations with the controversial kuchma , came out repeatedly in favor of the outgoing president 's chosen successor .
europe and washington , on the other hand , would like to see yushchenko , an economist who has promised to lead the country in a western direction , in power .
on wednesday , european commission chief jose barroso said the future of eu-ukraine relations depended on a fair election outcome .
" there will be consequences in the overall relations between the eu and ukraine if there is not a serious , objective and balanced review of the electoral process and the electoral results , " he said .

" i am deeply convinced that we have no moral right whatsoever to push a major european state to whatever mass mayhem , " said putin , according to reuters .
" from my perspective … all claims should go to the courts . "
tens of thousands of demonstrators have occupied kiev 's main square since sunday in protest of election results that gave the presidency to russian-favored viktor yanukovych .
opposition candidate viktor yushchenko and international observers have reported widespread election fraud .
on thursday , yushchenko won a significant battle when ukraine 's highest court ruled against the publication of the election results .
the ruling effectively blocks yanukovych 's inauguration .
eu , us want recount the opposition candidate enjoys strong support in western europe and washington .
former polish president lech walesa traveled to the capital and appeared with yuschenko at a rally .
while eu and the united states have called for a recount , putin reiterated his support for yanukovych on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the russian federation vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " both eu and russia are keen to see a stable , democratic country … and therefore we need to ensure that what is done reflects the will of the voters , " said dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country is holding the rotating presidency of the eu , following the meeting with putin .
but balkenende maintained that the election results should be examined by a team of international observers .
he acknowledged that though the approach might be different , russia and europe shared a desire that the country not become consumed in a spiral of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has been on the phone with yuschenko and outgoing president leonid kuchma , who favored yanukovych , as well as with us secretary of state colin powell and a few of his european counterparts .
turning point in young history referring to putin , fischer said that everyone " must work towards a democratic and acceptable solution . "
the fact that russian and western european leaders are weighing in the election show how important ukraine is becoming as a bridge between russia and europe .
observers say the election could mark a turning point in the ex-soviet republic 's recent history .
putin , who enjoyed close relations with the controversial kuchma , came out repeatedly in favor of the outgoing president 's chosen successor .
europe and washington , on the other hand , would like to see yushchenko , an economist who has promised to lead the country in a western direction , in power .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .

that must have been the logic at signal technology rossberg , near zwickau , which designed the new pedestrian lights 31 years after the first developing the male version .
only one example of the new ladylike traffic crossing has been installed so far , at zwickau 's busy crimmitschauer / werdauer street intersection .
the lights will have to survive a three-month trial period to see how they 're received , according to city spokeswoman angelika michaelis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr traffic men have cult status across germany - why not traffic women too ?
the traffic women wo n't offer much competition to their male counterparts though , since zwickau does n't have the funds to install the pig-tailed guides throughout town .
but michaelis suggested that traffic women may gradually be phased in when lights need to be replaced .
it 's odd , that the idea did n't come up sooner , since germany 's highway codes do n't stipulate traffic symbols must take a male form .
and the green and red ladies may just prove to be an improvement .
" if these female traffic symbols attract more attention , then from a traffic safety point of view , we have been vindicated , " michaelis said . dw staff -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " and finally ... "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.11.2004 a bank of their own großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women often feel underserved by traditional banks virginia woolf wrote that if a woman is to succeed -lrb- or write fiction -rrb- , she needs money and a room of her own .
some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .
but we live in an imperfect world , she added .
besides , men are welcome here , “ as long as they ’ re nice , ” she said . gisela essert had come to the opening reception to talk about a foundation for dyslexic children she wants to found .
she had made the rounds to banks , but since she has a background in the arts and has been self-employed for years , her financial résumé doesn ’ t fit the pattern bankers have been trained to look for before approving a loan . she said she does not expect special treatment at a women ’ s bank , besides , this idea is not about coddling women who need to be handled with kid gloves . “ this is the wrong image .
it ’ s just about giving women the right kind of support , ” she told dw-world .
“ i mean for hundreds of years men have created clubs for themselves and acquired a lot of power .
it ’ s natural , so why shouldn ’ t women do that as well ? ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for german women , glass ceiling hangs low pharmaceutical giant schering announced this week it would appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board – a sad first for germany .

" i am deeply convinced that we have no moral right whatsoever to push a major european state to whatever mass mayhem , " said putin , according to reuters .
" from my perspective … all claims should go to the courts . "
tens of thousands of demonstrators have occupied kiev 's main square since sunday in protest of election results that gave the presidency to russian-favored viktor yanukovych .
opposition candidate viktor yushchenko and international observers have reported widespread election fraud .
on thursday , yushchenko won a significant battle when ukraine 's highest court ruled against the publication of the election results .
the ruling effectively blocks yanukovych 's inauguration .
eu , us want recount the opposition candidate enjoys strong support in western europe and washington .
former polish president lech walesa traveled to the capital and appeared with yuschenko at a rally .
while eu and the united states have called for a recount , putin reiterated his support for yanukovych on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the russian federation vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " both eu and russia are keen to see a stable , democratic country … and therefore we need to ensure that what is done reflects the will of the voters , " said dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country is holding the rotating presidency of the eu , following the meeting with putin .
but balkenende maintained that the election results should be examined by a team of international observers .
he acknowledged that though the approach might be different , russia and europe shared a desire that the country not become consumed in a spiral of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has been on the phone with yuschenko and outgoing president leonid kuchma , who favored yanukovych , as well as with us secretary of state colin powell and a few of his european counterparts .
turning point in young history referring to putin , fischer said that everyone " must work towards a democratic and acceptable solution . "
the fact that russian and western european leaders are weighing in the election show how important ukraine is becoming as a bridge between russia and europe .
observers say the election could mark a turning point in the ex-soviet republic 's recent history .
putin , who enjoyed close relations with the controversial kuchma , came out repeatedly in favor of the outgoing president 's chosen successor .
europe and washington , on the other hand , would like to see yushchenko , an economist who has promised to lead the country in a western direction , in power .
on wednesday , european commission chief jose barroso said the future of eu-ukraine relations depended on a fair election outcome .
" there will be consequences in the overall relations between the eu and ukraine if there is not a serious , objective and balanced review of the electoral process and the electoral results , " he said .
opposition goes to court though exit polls on sunday indicated yushchenko had a lead of several percentage points over yanukovych , the official central election committee declared yanukovych the winner by a slim margin on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers guard the ukrainian presidential administration building in kiev yushchenko immediately protested as his supporters set up a tent city in front of rows and rows of riot police .
in the freezing cold and snow , they put flowers in the shields of the officers and called for change .
yushchenko 's campaign team have already filed a complaint to ukraine 's supreme court regarding the conduct of officials overseeing the election .
the estimated 3,000 international observers sent by the organization for security and cooperation in europe have reported widespread voter fraud - including ballot stuffing , and double voting by yanukovych supporters . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de which way , ukraine ?

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .
but we live in an imperfect world , she added .
besides , men are welcome here , “ as long as they ’ re nice , ” she said . gisela essert had come to the opening reception to talk about a foundation for dyslexic children she wants to found .
she had made the rounds to banks , but since she has a background in the arts and has been self-employed for years , her financial résumé doesn ’ t fit the pattern bankers have been trained to look for before approving a loan . she said she does not expect special treatment at a women ’ s bank , besides , this idea is not about coddling women who need to be handled with kid gloves . “ this is the wrong image .
it ’ s just about giving women the right kind of support , ” she told dw-world .
“ i mean for hundreds of years men have created clubs for themselves and acquired a lot of power .
it ’ s natural , so why shouldn ’ t women do that as well ? ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for german women , glass ceiling hangs low pharmaceutical giant schering announced this week it would appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board – a sad first for germany .

" i am deeply convinced that we have no moral right whatsoever to push a major european state to whatever mass mayhem , " said putin , according to reuters .
" from my perspective … all claims should go to the courts . "
tens of thousands of demonstrators have occupied kiev 's main square since sunday in protest of election results that gave the presidency to russian-favored viktor yanukovych .
opposition candidate viktor yushchenko and international observers have reported widespread election fraud .
on thursday , yushchenko won a significant battle when ukraine 's highest court ruled against the publication of the election results .
the ruling effectively blocks yanukovych 's inauguration .
eu , us want recount the opposition candidate enjoys strong support in western europe and washington .
former polish president lech walesa traveled to the capital and appeared with yuschenko at a rally .
while eu and the united states have called for a recount , putin reiterated his support for yanukovych on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the russian federation vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende " both eu and russia are keen to see a stable , democratic country … and therefore we need to ensure that what is done reflects the will of the voters , " said dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country is holding the rotating presidency of the eu , following the meeting with putin .
but balkenende maintained that the election results should be examined by a team of international observers .
he acknowledged that though the approach might be different , russia and europe shared a desire that the country not become consumed in a spiral of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has been on the phone with yuschenko and outgoing president leonid kuchma , who favored yanukovych , as well as with us secretary of state colin powell and a few of his european counterparts .
turning point in young history referring to putin , fischer said that everyone " must work towards a democratic and acceptable solution . "
the fact that russian and western european leaders are weighing in the election show how important ukraine is becoming as a bridge between russia and europe .
observers say the election could mark a turning point in the ex-soviet republic 's recent history .
putin , who enjoyed close relations with the controversial kuchma , came out repeatedly in favor of the outgoing president 's chosen successor .
europe and washington , on the other hand , would like to see yushchenko , an economist who has promised to lead the country in a western direction , in power .
on wednesday , european commission chief jose barroso said the future of eu-ukraine relations depended on a fair election outcome .
" there will be consequences in the overall relations between the eu and ukraine if there is not a serious , objective and balanced review of the electoral process and the electoral results , " he said .
opposition goes to court though exit polls on sunday indicated yushchenko had a lead of several percentage points over yanukovych , the official central election committee declared yanukovych the winner by a slim margin on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police officers guard the ukrainian presidential administration building in kiev yushchenko immediately protested as his supporters set up a tent city in front of rows and rows of riot police .
in the freezing cold and snow , they put flowers in the shields of the officers and called for change .
yushchenko 's campaign team have already filed a complaint to ukraine 's supreme court regarding the conduct of officials overseeing the election .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .
but we live in an imperfect world , she added .
besides , men are welcome here , “ as long as they ’ re nice , ” she said . gisela essert had come to the opening reception to talk about a foundation for dyslexic children she wants to found .
she had made the rounds to banks , but since she has a background in the arts and has been self-employed for years , her financial résumé doesn ’ t fit the pattern bankers have been trained to look for before approving a loan . she said she does not expect special treatment at a women ’ s bank , besides , this idea is not about coddling women who need to be handled with kid gloves . “ this is the wrong image .
it ’ s just about giving women the right kind of support , ” she told dw-world .
“ i mean for hundreds of years men have created clubs for themselves and acquired a lot of power .
it ’ s natural , so why shouldn ’ t women do that as well ? ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for german women , glass ceiling hangs low pharmaceutical giant schering announced this week it would appoint karin dorrepaal to its executive board – a sad first for germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.11.2004 iran backs down on uranium enrichment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's negotiator with iaea 's mohamed elbaradei after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons . on thursday , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , mohamed elbaradei , reported an impasse between the eu and iran on centrifuge devices .
just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .
the enrichment freeze was forged in talks with eu negotiators britain , france and germany in order to help tehran show good faith and avoid possible un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers visit the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade . "
he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it . " several diplomats said the iranians were merely trying to use the centrifuges as a bargaining chip to get the europeans to soften the resolution . iran maintains its nuclear program is strictly peaceful . afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues new nuclear demands the un atomic agency meets thursday to review a resolution under which iran is to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.11.2004 karstadtquelle gets the go-ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle has caught its rescuing life-buoy nothing more stands in the way of karstadtquelle 's planned capital increase .
the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .
the board said it now assumed that the capital increase could go ahead as planned . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle 's return to profit set back karstadtquelle , the crisis-ridden german retail giant , does not expect to turn in a profit until 2006 instead of 2005 , as expected .

" i am deeply convinced that we have no moral right whatsoever to push a major european state to whatever mass mayhem , " said putin , according to reuters .
" from my perspective … all claims should go to the courts . "
tens of thousands of demonstrators have occupied kiev 's main square since sunday in protest of election results that gave the presidency to russian-favored viktor yanukovych .
opposition candidate viktor yushchenko and international observers have reported widespread election fraud .
on thursday , yushchenko won a significant battle when ukraine 's highest court ruled against the publication of the election results .
the ruling effectively blocks yanukovych 's inauguration .
eu , us want recount the opposition candidate enjoys strong support in western europe and washington .
former polish president lech walesa traveled to the capital and appeared with yuschenko at a rally .

but balkenende maintained that the election results should be examined by a team of international observers .
he acknowledged that though the approach might be different , russia and europe shared a desire that the country not become consumed in a spiral of violence .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has been on the phone with yuschenko and outgoing president leonid kuchma , who favored yanukovych , as well as with us secretary of state colin powell and a few of his european counterparts .
turning point in young history referring to putin , fischer said that everyone " must work towards a democratic and acceptable solution . "
the fact that russian and western european leaders are weighing in the election show how important ukraine is becoming as a bridge between russia and europe .
observers say the election could mark a turning point in the ex-soviet republic 's recent history .
putin , who enjoyed close relations with the controversial kuchma , came out repeatedly in favor of the outgoing president 's chosen successor .
europe and washington , on the other hand , would like to see yushchenko , an economist who has promised to lead the country in a western direction , in power .
on wednesday , european commission chief jose barroso said the future of eu-ukraine relations depended on a fair election outcome .
" there will be consequences in the overall relations between the eu and ukraine if there is not a serious , objective and balanced review of the electoral process and the electoral results , " he said .

" i am deeply convinced that we have no moral right whatsoever to push a major european state to whatever mass mayhem , " said putin , according to reuters .
" from my perspective … all claims should go to the courts . "
tens of thousands of demonstrators have occupied kiev 's main square since sunday in protest of election results that gave the presidency to russian-favored viktor yanukovych .
opposition candidate viktor yushchenko and international observers have reported widespread election fraud .
on thursday , yushchenko won a significant battle when ukraine 's highest court ruled against the publication of the election results .
the ruling effectively blocks yanukovych 's inauguration .
eu , us want recount the opposition candidate enjoys strong support in western europe and washington .

europe and washington , on the other hand , would like to see yushchenko , an economist who has promised to lead the country in a western direction , in power .
on wednesday , european commission chief jose barroso said the future of eu-ukraine relations depended on a fair election outcome .
" there will be consequences in the overall relations between the eu and ukraine if there is not a serious , objective and balanced review of the electoral process and the electoral results , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.11.2004 iran backs down on uranium enrichment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's negotiator with iaea 's mohamed elbaradei after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons . on thursday , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , mohamed elbaradei , reported an impasse between the eu and iran on centrifuge devices .
just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .
the enrichment freeze was forged in talks with eu negotiators britain , france and germany in order to help tehran show good faith and avoid possible un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers visit the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade . "
he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it . " several diplomats said the iranians were merely trying to use the centrifuges as a bargaining chip to get the europeans to soften the resolution . iran maintains its nuclear program is strictly peaceful . afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues new nuclear demands the un atomic agency meets thursday to review a resolution under which iran is to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.11.2004 karstadtquelle gets the go-ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle has caught its rescuing life-buoy nothing more stands in the way of karstadtquelle 's planned capital increase .
the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.11.2004 eu joins ukrainian crisis round table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu envoys solana , left , and kwasniewski , right , in kiev ukraine 's two rival presidential candidates met friday for the first time since the disputed weekend vote in the presence of president leonid kuchma and european and russian mediators . attempts to mediate the political crisis in ukraine gathered pace friday when several key eu envoys arrived in kiev for a high-level meeting with the principle actors in ukraine 's current political crisis : outgoing president leonid kuchma and the two rival presidential candidates , viktor yanukovych and viktor yushchenko . the arrival of eu foreign policy chief solana and polish president kwasniewski is just the latest in the increasing efforts by external officials to mediate in the crisis over the disputed weekend presidential vote . according to german public broadcaster ard , a recount of the votes has been suggested as a possible solution to the stand-off .
but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .
no one , even the supreme court , has the right to annul it , " argued yanukovych spokesman sergei tigipko . protests continue across ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections in front of the ukrainian government building in kiev .
meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten ! "
hundreds of yanukovych supporters who had gathered there earlier in the day had left , abandoning their tents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other opposition members gathered in front of the parliament and presidential administration .
" we will win !
ukrainians have never been so united , " said vladimir , 23 , who has braved the bitter cold winter weather for three days .
" we will stay in kiev until yushchenko is president , " he said , adding " we will fight only by legal means , we do n't want any violence . " teachers in the western opposition bastion city of lviv went on strike as thousands of students boycotted classes in hundreds of schools .

but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen .

the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .

" can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen .

at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .

analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .

the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.11.2004 karstadtquelle gets the go-ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle has caught its rescuing life-buoy nothing more stands in the way of karstadtquelle 's planned capital increase .
the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .
the board said it now assumed that the capital increase could go ahead as planned . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle 's return to profit set back karstadtquelle , the crisis-ridden german retail giant , does not expect to turn in a profit until 2006 instead of 2005 , as expected .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .

some women in munich are applying that philosophy to the financial world , starting a bank by and for women . with its wooden floors , comfy couches and bookshelves the the place bears little resemblance to the cold marble halls of germany 's powerful financial institutions . but if all goes to plan , this humble storefront in munich could be the start of a banking empire - one with the woman in mind . “ the point is not so much that women need something else , a different kind of bank , ” astrid hastreiter told dw-world at the opening reception of the financial organization she is starting .
“ many women simply want something else . ” at the frauenbank , or women ’ s bank , she says , they ’ ll get it .
counseling about investments , retirement plans , savings and other financial tools will be done by female professionals , who understand the special needs of women , many of whom feel uncomfortable or underserved in traditional financial institutions . hastreiter points to a study that shows 80 percent of women feel they are not taken seriously by big banks , which are still predominately male institutions . bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter the 40-year-old it professional has been on the board of a computer training center for women for a decade , and said over that time she heard complaints repeatedly from women who had negative experiences talking to a three-piece-suit down at the local branch .
though questions of style and empathy are important in the financial world , they are too rarely taken into consideration . “ talking about money and financial planning is a very intimate thing in a way , since money affects every aspect of people ’ s lives , ” she said .
“ that means not everyone wants to do that in an atmosphere where some buttoned-down banker is sitting across from you .
so a lot of women simply avoid it . ” different focus women often have different needs and interests than men do when it comes to financial matters .
for many , hastreiter said , while profit is important , it is not always the primary consideration .
other aspects , for example what her money is working for or whether it is in an investment fund that meets certain ethical criteria , can plan an equal role . considerations such as an investment ’ s liquidity and flexibility are also often more important to women than men .
women who have children often want to be able to turn their investment into cash quickly should an emergency arise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's bank logo having a family can also mean a woman ’ s career path has taken a different trajectory than a man ’ s .
women are more likely to spend years outside the work force raising kids , working part time , or being self-employed .
explaining this to a traditional banker who is just looking at the bottom line can be difficult . “ i think that women often feel better when they get financial counseling by other women because they have a like-minded person there in front of them . ”
simone westermeyer , a financial counselor at the women ’ s bank , told dw-world .
“ she also might have more understanding for issues that face women . ” slow start getting the women ’ s bank off the ground has not been easy .
hastreiter and a partner , angelika huber , started working on the project more than three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : astrid hastreiter , left , and former partner angelika huber in 2001 they sent out their first letters to potential investors in september 2001 , days before the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
the subsequent insecurity in the financial world and difficulties in getting a banking license caused the two to scale back their initial plans . then earlier this year huber pulled out of the project , “ for health reasons , ” hastreiter said . now the bank has developed a three-step strategy leading toward full banking operations .
the first phase will focus on financial counseling , networking and education , such as seminars about money matters for women .
the bank ’ s board are also widening their group of investors and building capital by selling participating certificates . the second phase would see the acquisition of a partial banking license and an expansion of services .
after enough capital is raised – new banks need at least € 5 million , € 10 million is better – full banking services could be offered , including giro or checking accounts , investment services , and loans , particularly small-business loans . “ one in three small businesses are founded by women , but women still have more problems than men do in getting loans , ” hastreiter said . stereotyping part of that is due to the fact that stubborn stereotypes still prevail when it comes to women and finance , namely , that the two don ’ t exactly go hand and hand .
professor gertraude kress , a researcher of gender and management issues at berlin ’ s free university , compares it to buying a car . “ you go to a male seller or to male banker and maybe they think , ‘ oh , it ’ s only a woman , she ’ s doesn ’ t know anything about cars , she doesn ’ t know anything about money or finance , ’ ” she told dw-world . she said the women ’ s bank is following a trend in the business world of marketing services and products to niche groups , such as ethnic minorities or gays and lesbians , who also can feel underserved by big institutions .
but she worries about the message a special bank for women could send out . “ if you say we are founding a bank especially for women , you signal that all women have the same interests and those interests are different from the interests and needs of men .
that ’ s not true , ” she said .
“ it ’ s another kind of stereotyping . ” babying women ? astrid hastreiter can understand the critics who say it shouldn ’ t be the case that in 2004 germany needs a special financial institution for women .
but we live in an imperfect world , she added .
besides , men are welcome here , “ as long as they ’ re nice , ” she said . gisela essert had come to the opening reception to talk about a foundation for dyslexic children she wants to found .
she had made the rounds to banks , but since she has a background in the arts and has been self-employed for years , her financial résumé doesn ’ t fit the pattern bankers have been trained to look for before approving a loan . she said she does not expect special treatment at a women ’ s bank , besides , this idea is not about coddling women who need to be handled with kid gloves . “ this is the wrong image .
it ’ s just about giving women the right kind of support , ” she told dw-world .
“ i mean for hundreds of years men have created clubs for themselves and acquired a lot of power .

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .

just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .
the enrichment freeze was forged in talks with eu negotiators britain , france and germany in order to help tehran show good faith and avoid possible un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers visit the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade . "
he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.11.2004 karstadtquelle gets the go-ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle has caught its rescuing life-buoy nothing more stands in the way of karstadtquelle 's planned capital increase .
the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .
the board said it now assumed that the capital increase could go ahead as planned . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle 's return to profit set back karstadtquelle , the crisis-ridden german retail giant , does not expect to turn in a profit until 2006 instead of 2005 , as expected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.11.2004 karstadtquelle gets the go-ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle has caught its rescuing life-buoy nothing more stands in the way of karstadtquelle 's planned capital increase .
the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .
the board said it now assumed that the capital increase could go ahead as planned . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle 's return to profit set back karstadtquelle , the crisis-ridden german retail giant , does not expect to turn in a profit until 2006 instead of 2005 , as expected .

but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .

the german retailer has reached an agreement with minority shareholders opposed to the plans . the restructuring plan for embattled german retailer karstadtquelle can proceed .
a group of six minority shareholders , who had formally objected to an injection of fresh capital aimed to ensure the group 's survival , have given their approval .
" we have reached an agreement with the differing shareholders , " group spokesman jörg howe told the press following the tenacious negotiations thursday .
he said karstadtquelle could assume that the capital increase and a line of credit totalling € 1.75 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- were ensured for three years .
at a turbulent emergency shareholder meeting earlier in the week in düsseldorf , karstadtquelle overwhelmingly won the vote for the rights issue it needed to keep its banks on board .
but the objection by the group of six would have delayed the share issue by a crucial period .
this would have endangered the line of credit and , in the words of supervisory board head thomas middelhoff , possibly led to the group 's insolvency .
according to howe , karstadtquelle would also make efforts to create additional financial leeway .
now , it could attend to its " very important , for us almost vital christmas business , " he added .
understanding for shareholders ' interests karstadtquelle 's management board said it showed " understanding " for the dissenting shareholders ’ point of view .
in a statement issued thursday , it said that " the objections raised by the shareholders represent an acceptable and normal concern for shareholders ’ interests . "
the board has pledged to ensure that the issue price of the new shares will not fall below the amount of € 5.38 .
this will ensure that the company amasses at least € 500 million without an additional capital increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle wo n't be closing its doors , afterall .
the shareholders had initially objected that the planned minimum issue price of only € 4.00 per share was " unacceptably low . "
the board said it would also issue additional information of the report by roland berger on the reconstruction concept .
shareholders had protested that initial information at the general meeting with regard to the capital increase was inadequate and contradictory .
no financial compensation in addition , karstadtquelle 's shareholders can expect an explanation .
" the management board will present in the 2004 annual report a detailed risk report which goes into the causes of the crisis that the company finds itself in at present , " the group said .
the shareholders will also be kept up to date about the position and progress made with the reconstruction measures .
in light of these agreements , the dissenting shareholders declared that no further legal measures against the resolution on the capital increase would result from their formally registered objection .
howe vigorously dismissed speculations that shareholders just wanted to get money out of their objection .
" no money exchanged hands , " he said .
the board said it now assumed that the capital increase could go ahead as planned . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karstadtquelle 's return to profit set back karstadtquelle , the crisis-ridden german retail giant , does not expect to turn in a profit until 2006 instead of 2005 , as expected .

just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .
the enrichment freeze was forged in talks with eu negotiators britain , france and germany in order to help tehran show good faith and avoid possible un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers visit the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade . "
he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it . " several diplomats said the iranians were merely trying to use the centrifuges as a bargaining chip to get the europeans to soften the resolution . iran maintains its nuclear program is strictly peaceful . afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues new nuclear demands the un atomic agency meets thursday to review a resolution under which iran is to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .

but calling for new elections , yushchenko has reportedly already rejected the proposal . also at friday 's meeting were lithuanian president valdas adamkus , boris gryzlov , speaker of russia 's lower house of parliament and a trusted lieutenant of vladimir putin , and jan kubis , the current head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . kuchma 's spokeswoman , olena gromitska , cited her boss as saying at the start of negotiations between the two rivals : " only talks can resolve the difficult situation that was created after the election .
it can be resolved through compromise . " can the west play a role ? however , it was unclear how much influence the european envoys would have , as prime minister viktor yanukovych , who was still claiming victory in the face of mass public demonstrations against him , lashed out at the west for backing an opposition that was engaged in " anti-democratic and illegal acts , " in a reference to the massive street protests that have paralyzed central kiev since sunday . he told thousands of supporters in the streets , many of whom had been brought in by train from his eastern power base : " dear friends , together we must do everything so that an unconstitutional coup in ukraine does not happen . " attempts by international dignitaries to mediate in the crisis began thursday when polish nobel peace prize winner lech walesa arrived in the ukrainian capital on a surprise peace mission .
" it is all going in the right direction , " said the former polish president and solidarity trade union leader after meeting both self-declared presidents . nations the world over have slowly begun to split into camps over sunday 's vote .
britain added its voice to western nations refusing to recognize yanukovych 's win but china joined russia and authoritarian belarus in saying that the election was fair . russia claims tensions exacerbated by eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , left , and dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende during a press conference of the eu-russia summit in the hague on thursday , russian president vladimir putin sent geopolitical tensions soaring thursday when he accused europe of stoking street discontent in ukraine by tacitly backing the protesters .
at a summit meeting in the netherlands , putin firmly told eu leaders : " we have no moral right to push a major european country to mass mayhem . " for his part dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told a press conference : " the election did not meet the international standards .
therefore the eu is not able to accept the results . " the battle for ukraine has brought back echoes of the cold war stand-off between moscow and the west , with russia refusing to see its allies lose power in a country that serves as a buffer between it and an expanding european union , which moscow views with growing distrust .
analysts say the kremlin further fears that a win by the pro-west opposition in ukraine could prompt other former soviet republics to rise against pro-moscow rule . that shift towards a pro-western government in ukraine was given more credence on thursday when ukraine 's supreme court gave the opposition a glimmer of hope by delaying publication of results of the disputed vote . court holds fire on decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich .
the court ruled that poll results announced by the central election commission on wednesday , handing victory to yanukovych , the kremlin-backed prime minister , could not be published until it reviewed the opposition ’ s appeal which alleged widespread vote-rigging .
the western-leaning , nationalist opposition is demanding the vote results be annulled in several eastern pro-russia regions or for a brand new election to be called . official publication would make the outcome final and pave the way for yanukovych 's inauguration as president .
the ruling party vented fury at the announcement that opposition leader viktor yushchenko 's claim will be heard monday . " the election took place .
the central electoral commission recognized it and issued a final result .
no one , even the supreme court , has the right to annul it , " argued yanukovych spokesman sergei tigipko . protests continue across ukraine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have gathered to protest alleged fraud in the presidential elections in front of the ukrainian government building in kiev .
meanwhile protests escalated in ukraine itself on the first official day of civil disobedience as opposition leaders stepped up the pressure by calling their supporters to blockade government buildings . orange opposition flags hung out of the central bank building and a deputy economy minister became the first official to resign over the vote that he said was turning his country into a european outcast . tens of thousands of orange-clad people answered thursday 's call for the demonstration of people power , taking over the part of the capital that houses the main government buildings . a crowd of thousands gathered in front of the government building , chanting " we are many , strong , we will not be beaten ! "
hundreds of yanukovych supporters who had gathered there earlier in the day had left , abandoning their tents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other opposition members gathered in front of the parliament and presidential administration .
" we will win !
ukrainians have never been so united , " said vladimir , 23 , who has braved the bitter cold winter weather for three days .
" we will stay in kiev until yushchenko is president , " he said , adding " we will fight only by legal means , we do n't want any violence . " teachers in the western opposition bastion city of lviv went on strike as thousands of students boycotted classes in hundreds of schools .

just days after iran had promised the european union it would stop all activities related to uranium enrichment , it demanded an exemption for about 20 enrichment centrifuges for research purposes . diplomats from the eu had said this was impossible and would deepen suspicions held by the united states that iran was working on a secret weapons program . but in the face of intense international pressure , iran backed down on friday and dropped the demand . " they -lrb- iran -rrb- have agreed to drop the demand and -lrb- the eu -rrb- are awaiting confirmation that a letter has been given to -lrb- un nuclear watchdog chief elbaradei -rrb- confirming this , " a diplomat told reuters . the head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , hossein mousavian , also said agreement had been reached , although it needed the final ok from tehran . " we are fully committed to a suspension of enrichment and related activities , " he told reuters . the impasse had threatened to kill the entire agreement hammered out earlier this month in paris between the eu and iran .
when asked what had moved iran to back down from its demand regarding the centrifuges , one diplomat told reuters : " it was -lrb- the eu 's -rrb- hard stance .
the iranians just gave up . " unacceptable to europe and washington " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat had said of iran 's centrifuge request .

iran was also taking a hard-line stance against a draft un resolution by the european trio in moves which stalled the crucial iaea meeting on allaying international concern over its nuclear program , which the united states claims is devoted to secretly developing atomic weapons . iran 's request to amend the original agreement also infuriated the united states , which has long accused tehran of trying to building an atomic bomb .
washington is also said to be unhappy with the eu-iran deal , but has indicated it would not block them . the us has for over a year been trying to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , but non-aligned states , as well as the european trio and russia and china , have opposed this , saying iran must be given a chance to cooperate with a two-year-old iaea investigation of its nuclear program . upping the ante but iran keeps on upping the ante , diplomats said .
iran continued to produce the uranium gas that is the first step in the enrichment process only days before monday 's ban , a move one european diplomat characterized as " not very helpful " as it led to doubts about iran 's intentions and the future of the suspension deal . gary samore , a non-proliferation expert from london 's international institute for strategic studies , told afp the iranians apparently want to " clear the technical hurdle of running centrifuges together in a cascade .

he said this explains why they want to do research work with a small amount of centrifuges " but what surprises me is that they think they can get away with it .

by finlo rohrer bbc news a shadowy figure clad in a top hat and cape , carrying a shiny leather bag through the london fog , the popular image of jack the ripper continues to be iconic 116 years after he terrorised the east end .
the murders still inspire countless films and books this week , press reports of tests on a watch led to the finger again being pointed at james maybrick , a 19th century liverpool cotton merchant .
it is a criminal case where a year rarely goes by without a new development or conspiracy theory , but those investigating admit it will almost certainly never be solved .
so why do legions of jack the ripper enthusiasts , known as ripperologists , remain obsessed by the identity of the killer who mutilated prostitutes in the area around whitechapel ?
there are an awful lot of people , particularly in the states , who do n't believe jack the ripper actually existed paul begg author for paul begg , author of upcoming book jack the ripper : the facts , the killer has become more than a match for any fictional figure from the world of horror .
" there are an awful lot of people , particularly in the states , who do n't believe jack the ripper actually existed .
they think he is a fictional character along with frankenstein and dracula .
" for most people jack the ripper personifies the fear that we all have of the lurker in the shadows , that thing we can offer no defence against . "
sickert row new books are released every year , many of them identifying a new wealthy victorian candidate for the crimes and an elaborate conspiracy theory for the ripperologists to gorge themselves on .
they populate the message boards of the comprehensive casebook website and argue endlessly over the multitude of competing hypotheses .
but us detective novelist patricia cornwell has perhaps gone further than any other ripperologist in her search for the truth .
spending as much as $ 6m researching her book , she named celebrated british artist walter sickert as the murderer .
the suspects prince albert victor - grandson of queen victoria james maybrick - liverpool cotton merchant walter sickert - artist dr william gull - royal physician aaron kosminski - polish jewish immigrant michael ostrog - thief montague john druitt - barrister and teacher francis tumblety - us quack doctor joseph barnett - boyfriend of victim countless others she generated outrage in the art world by having a sickert painting cut up , and purchased 31 other works in her quest to prove the artist was the killer using a barrage of forensic tests .
but despite the definitive title portrait of a killer : jack the ripper - case closed , she was unable to prove sickert 's guilt and her theory was widely dismissed by leading ripperologists .
to trevor marriott , a retired murder squad detective from bedfordshire , not only will the case never be solved , but all of the facts will remain disputed , even down to whether the ripper killed more than the five women attributed to him .
" there are a hardcore of people throughout the world who will always be interested .
there are people who live and die the ripper .
" i sometimes wonder whether they want the crime to be solved .
there are some people who wo n't accept any facts .
nothing 's ever going to change them . "
mr marriott , who has spent more than a decade researching the killings since his retirement in 1988 , said he had sympathy for the officers who had failed to catch the killer .
" a lot of my police service was at a time when we did n't have modern forensic methods .
these methods have come to the forefront in my time .
" it was good old fashioned police work , which was all they had at the time of the ripper murders .
whitechapel murders 3 april 1888 - emma elizabeth smith 7 august 1888 - martha tabram 31 august 1888 - mary ann nichols * 8 september 1888 - annie chapman * 30 september 1888 - elizabeth stride * 30 september 1888 - catherine eddowes * 9 november 1888 - mary jane kelly * 20 december 1888 - rose mylett 17 july 1889 - alice mckenzie 10 september 1889 - unknown woman 13 february 1891 - frances coles * usually identified as the ripper murders " as a detective something like this is always of interest .
you try to apply modern day investigative techniques .
if i had been around then , what would i have done differently .
they seem to have missed a lot of avenues of inquiry that i would have pursued .
" i regret not having now the power of a police officer to go to places and demand things .
it does prove difficult . "
for neil storey , author of a grim almanac of jack the ripper 's london , the rise of the iconic imagery of the killer is tied into the rise of the " gutter press " .
" to writers at the turn of the century , the east end was a third world in the most powerful empire in the world , with poverty akin to the poorest corners , it was a phenomenon .
" when this series of murders come along that are incredible , are unsolved , it ties in with this mysterious world of poverty , and it rings all the bells that that the various media had .
trevor marriott , a retired murder detective , has spent a decade investigating " pure unadulterated crime and disaster -lsb- was the making -rsb- of the gutter press .
" he became a stalking bogeyman that children were threatened with , a folk devil .
kids had skipping rhymes and played catch games that mentioned him . "
along with patricia cornwell 's controversial work , the most hotly disputed theory is that naming james maybrick as the man responsible .
a diary , alleged to be that of maybrick , and containing his confession to the gruesome killings , was made public in the early 1990s .

by finlo rohrer bbc news a shadowy figure clad in a top hat and cape , carrying a shiny leather bag through the london fog , the popular image of jack the ripper continues to be iconic 116 years after he terrorised the east end .
the murders still inspire countless films and books this week , press reports of tests on a watch led to the finger again being pointed at james maybrick , a 19th century liverpool cotton merchant .
it is a criminal case where a year rarely goes by without a new development or conspiracy theory , but those investigating admit it will almost certainly never be solved .
so why do legions of jack the ripper enthusiasts , known as ripperologists , remain obsessed by the identity of the killer who mutilated prostitutes in the area around whitechapel ?
there are an awful lot of people , particularly in the states , who do n't believe jack the ripper actually existed paul begg author for paul begg , author of upcoming book jack the ripper : the facts , the killer has become more than a match for any fictional figure from the world of horror .
" there are an awful lot of people , particularly in the states , who do n't believe jack the ripper actually existed .
they think he is a fictional character along with frankenstein and dracula .
" for most people jack the ripper personifies the fear that we all have of the lurker in the shadows , that thing we can offer no defence against . "
sickert row new books are released every year , many of them identifying a new wealthy victorian candidate for the crimes and an elaborate conspiracy theory for the ripperologists to gorge themselves on .
they populate the message boards of the comprehensive casebook website and argue endlessly over the multitude of competing hypotheses .
but us detective novelist patricia cornwell has perhaps gone further than any other ripperologist in her search for the truth .
spending as much as $ 6m researching her book , she named celebrated british artist walter sickert as the murderer .
the suspects prince albert victor - grandson of queen victoria james maybrick - liverpool cotton merchant walter sickert - artist dr william gull - royal physician aaron kosminski - polish jewish immigrant michael ostrog - thief montague john druitt - barrister and teacher francis tumblety - us quack doctor joseph barnett - boyfriend of victim countless others she generated outrage in the art world by having a sickert painting cut up , and purchased 31 other works in her quest to prove the artist was the killer using a barrage of forensic tests .
but despite the definitive title portrait of a killer : jack the ripper - case closed , she was unable to prove sickert 's guilt and her theory was widely dismissed by leading ripperologists .
to trevor marriott , a retired murder squad detective from bedfordshire , not only will the case never be solved , but all of the facts will remain disputed , even down to whether the ripper killed more than the five women attributed to him .
" there are a hardcore of people throughout the world who will always be interested .
there are people who live and die the ripper .
" i sometimes wonder whether they want the crime to be solved .
there are some people who wo n't accept any facts .

mr marriott , who has spent more than a decade researching the killings since his retirement in 1988 , said he had sympathy for the officers who had failed to catch the killer .

" i regret not having now the power of a police officer to go to places and demand things .

for neil storey , author of a grim almanac of jack the ripper 's london , the rise of the iconic imagery of the killer is tied into the rise of the " gutter press " .
" to writers at the turn of the century , the east end was a third world in the most powerful empire in the world , with poverty akin to the poorest corners , it was a phenomenon .

" i regret not having now the power of a police officer to go to places and demand things .
it does prove difficult . "
for neil storey , author of a grim almanac of jack the ripper 's london , the rise of the iconic imagery of the killer is tied into the rise of the " gutter press " .
" to writers at the turn of the century , the east end was a third world in the most powerful empire in the world , with poverty akin to the poorest corners , it was a phenomenon .
" when this series of murders come along that are incredible , are unsolved , it ties in with this mysterious world of poverty , and it rings all the bells that that the various media had .
" pure unadulterated crime and disaster -lsb- was the making -rsb- of the gutter press .
" he became a stalking bogeyman that children were threatened with , a folk devil .
kids had skipping rhymes and played catch games that mentioned him . "
along with patricia cornwell 's controversial work , the most hotly disputed theory is that naming james maybrick as the man responsible .
a diary , alleged to be that of maybrick , and containing his confession to the gruesome killings , was made public in the early 1990s .
but it has failed to convince most of the leading ripper authors , who accept that while it has not been proved to be a fake , it has also not been proved to be genuine .
and while ripperologists continue their hunt , it is clear that jack the ripper will be imprinted on the consciousness of the english-speaking world for many years to come .

when you turn the lights on in your home , how often do you consider the wider environmental implications of your actions ?
traditional electric lightbulbs soak up energy and regularly need replacing .
faced by the threat of global warming , european governments have been imposing increasingly tough measures on the public to try to crack down on energy waste .
switching to low energy lightbulbs - known as compact fluorescent lamps , or cfls - is perhaps one of the few practical ways we can help to cut down on energy use .
for years environmental groups have been telling us to buy cfls , which cost more than traditional bulbs , but last longer .
chemicals but every time you use low energy lights , are you actually helping the environment ?
builder and author jeff howell , who writes for britain 's sunday telegraph and independent newspapers , does not think so .
" they certainly do use less energy but we are not taking into consideration the amount of energy used in manufacturing them , " he says .
" they also contain nasty chemicals and heavy metals , and they are supposed to be disposed of by licensed , environmentally aware , waste recycling plants .
people are often not aware of this , and when these bulbs break they are dumped in dustbins and they go to landfill sites or incinerators . "
however , the world 's largest low energy lightbulb maker , philips , is proud of its product 's green credentials .
efficiency berno rahman , the dutch company 's european marketing manager , says that only 5 % of the total energy used in the lifetime of a cfl bulb occurs during its manufacture .
" increasing efficiency is always better , " he says .
philips hopes to reduce the heavy metal content in its cfl lightbulbs , but eliminating it altogether is still some way off .
" as far as i know there is no technology available for cfl manufacturing that can get rid of mercury at the moment , " mr rahman says .
however much energy cfls save , it is a drop in the ocean compared with the energy consumed by one of the west 's great luxuries - air conditioning .
even in cold northern european countries such as sweden and the uk , air conditioning is becoming ubiquitous - and demand is growing .
higher costs this is something that has got architect howard liddell , who advises the scottish parliament , hot under the collar .
" there was a proposal about seven or eight years ago for the building regulations to have a presumption against air conditioning in the uk and the industry fought against that and the industry won , " he says .
mr liddell argues that the increased use of air conditioning , particularly in summer , is also leading to much higher fuel bills .
whenever new green regulations are proposed , governments attempt to find common ground between industry and environmentalists .
but what if the real green answer is that certain industries have to contract - make less glass , produce fewer ventilation units and suchlike .
would governments bite that bullet in the face of industry pressure ?
john goodhall , of the european construction industry federation , says his members are working hard installing insulation and finding other energy saving solutions .
" as global warming starts to take hold , the need for air conditioning will become that much greater and the problems of insulating buildings will become even more accentuated , " he says .
" by one estimate it has been said that if we go on the way we are , and global warming really does accelerate , we shall see much higher temperatures in northern europe . "
" we have buildings that were never designed to accommodate air conditioning , and that may ultimately lead to there being massive demolition projects -lsb- for those buildings -rsb- because they will eventually become uninhabitable in the summer time . "

philips hopes to reduce the heavy metal content in its cfl lightbulbs , but eliminating it altogether is still some way off .
" as far as i know there is no technology available for cfl manufacturing that can get rid of mercury at the moment , " mr rahman says .
however much energy cfls save , it is a drop in the ocean compared with the energy consumed by one of the west 's great luxuries - air conditioning .
even in cold northern european countries such as sweden and the uk , air conditioning is becoming ubiquitous - and demand is growing .
higher costs this is something that has got architect howard liddell , who advises the scottish parliament , hot under the collar .
" there was a proposal about seven or eight years ago for the building regulations to have a presumption against air conditioning in the uk and the industry fought against that and the industry won , " he says .
mr liddell argues that the increased use of air conditioning , particularly in summer , is also leading to much higher fuel bills .
whenever new green regulations are proposed , governments attempt to find common ground between industry and environmentalists .
but what if the real green answer is that certain industries have to contract - make less glass , produce fewer ventilation units and suchlike .
would governments bite that bullet in the face of industry pressure ?
john goodhall , of the european construction industry federation , says his members are working hard installing insulation and finding other energy saving solutions .
" as global warming starts to take hold , the need for air conditioning will become that much greater and the problems of insulating buildings will become even more accentuated , " he says .
" by one estimate it has been said that if we go on the way we are , and global warming really does accelerate , we shall see much higher temperatures in northern europe . "
" we have buildings that were never designed to accommodate air conditioning , and that may ultimately lead to there being massive demolition projects -lsb- for those buildings -rsb- because they will eventually become uninhabitable in the summer time . "

when you turn the lights on in your home , how often do you consider the wider environmental implications of your actions ?
traditional electric lightbulbs soak up energy and regularly need replacing .
faced by the threat of global warming , european governments have been imposing increasingly tough measures on the public to try to crack down on energy waste .
switching to low energy lightbulbs - known as compact fluorescent lamps , or cfls - is perhaps one of the few practical ways we can help to cut down on energy use .
for years environmental groups have been telling us to buy cfls , which cost more than traditional bulbs , but last longer .
chemicals but every time you use low energy lights , are you actually helping the environment ?
builder and author jeff howell , who writes for britain 's sunday telegraph and independent newspapers , does not think so .
" they certainly do use less energy but we are not taking into consideration the amount of energy used in manufacturing them , " he says .
" they also contain nasty chemicals and heavy metals , and they are supposed to be disposed of by licensed , environmentally aware , waste recycling plants .
people are often not aware of this , and when these bulbs break they are dumped in dustbins and they go to landfill sites or incinerators . "
however , the world 's largest low energy lightbulb maker , philips , is proud of its product 's green credentials .
