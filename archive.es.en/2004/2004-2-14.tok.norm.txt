german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

"
" head-on , " a film by a german-turkish director won the golden bear at the 54th berlin film festival saturday , marking the first time in 18 years that a submission from germany managed to take the berlinale 's top prize . an international jury led by u.s. actress frances mcdormand also awarded south african charlize theron a silver bear for her role in " monster " and uruguay 's daniel hendler won a best actor award for his role as a young jewish architect in the low-budget argentine film " lost embrace " -lrb- el abrazo partido -rrb- . directed by german-turkish director fatih akin , " head-on " -lrb- gegen die wand -rrb- tells the story of a marriage of convenience between two turks in hamburg : young sibel , who is trying to escape the influence of her traditional family , and the older and self-destructive cahit . " i love this film , " jury president mcdormand told the reuters new agency .
" it said in a wonderful way so many things that a lot of the other films said as well .
' head-on ' told them in a most powerful and most modern way . " the film beat out 22 other submissions in the competition , which took place over ten days in the german capital .
the festival also included a range of other events such as a short film festival , a section for upcoming art house movies called panorama and screenings of the latest offerings in " german cinema . " german cineman revival the golden bear for " head-on " continues what appears to be the beginnings of a revival of the german film industry , following the international success of " good bye , lenin ! " and the oscar last year for " nowhere in africa . "
it would also seem like berlinale director dieter kosslick 's efforts to use the event to strengthen the position of german cinema around the world is paying off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-turkish director fatih akin .
akin , whose film focusing on the problems of second and third-generation turkish immigrants in germany , said he was pleased he could " make two countries happy at the same time " with the award . after the heavy topic matter of " head-on " - the film has plenty of violence and sadness - akin said he hoped to make a comedy next .
" my best work lies ahead of me , " the 30-year-old said on saturday . although " head-on " had been popular with festival-goers , its win comes as a bit of a surprise since other movies including " before sunset " starring ethan hawke and julie delpy and " ae fond kiss " by british director ken loach had been among the favorites . but its success should n't hurt the berlinale , which will continue to jockey with cannes and venice for glamour and influence among europe 's leading film festivals . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2004 dw-world 's complete berlinale coverage .

dw-world 's eleonora volodina spoke with him about the film . dw-world : your film is about turkish immigrants in germany .
do you think you have to be turkish to deal with the subject with in such a blunt manner ? fatih akin : i did n't want the characters to represent the whole turkish minority .
they were outsiders in this community .
that interested me from the very beginning .
i did not much think which were the turkish elements .
i was born with it and grew up with it .
i was on the inside and did not reflect upon it that much .
i did it later , not when i was making the movie . still the girl has to fight against her conservative muslim heritage . the girl is crazy somehow .
she wants to kill herself , she is going head on into the wall .
she does not accept the pressure .
there is a certain kind of pressure , a certain kind of dogmatism , that especially turkish females face in our society , here in germany more , than in turkey .
and she is fighting against it .
that was interesting .
sure , she was rebelling , but as an outsider , not as someone typical .
we tried to show the family not as a typical one .
her mother is very modern , even the brother accepts the male hero , even if he is a lump , because he loves her , because it is good for the sister . should immigrants drop their traditions and heritage and integrate in a new society ? the answer is somewhere in between .
me personally , i stand in opposition of tradition , but i am also loyal to tradition .
i don ’ t say everything is wrong .
i don ’ t believe in that .
i would like to keep a lot of stuff from the turkish heritage , some things i would not like to keep because i don ’ t accept them .
i was born in germany , went to german school .
to try to keep the respect – that is very important to me .
that is why it was important to show the family in respectful way . at the end they return to turkey , where their roots are .
is that the only way to find perhaps not happiness but at least some piece and quiet ?
is the message that immigrants can find peace only where they came from ? well , i don ’ t know .
the tricky thing about all the stuff is that the personal home is germany .
she was born in germany .
he grew up in germany .
he is so german that he does not almost speak turkish anymore .
he does not look even turkish anymore .
they go somehow to a foreign country , or to a new country .
not to their home .
that is a general idea .
they have to escape . starting over ? yes , exactly .
both are on a quest .
he is trying to find himself .
she is trying to find herself .
and the moment when the film stops , it is just the moment , where the film stops .
we don ’ t know what happens next .
do they stay there , do they go away .
she accepts her new life , but we don ’ t know if she is very happy with it .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

"
" head-on , " a film by a german-turkish director won the golden bear at the 54th berlin film festival saturday , marking the first time in 18 years that a submission from germany managed to take the berlinale 's top prize . an international jury led by u.s. actress frances mcdormand also awarded south african charlize theron a silver bear for her role in " monster " and uruguay 's daniel hendler won a best actor award for his role as a young jewish architect in the low-budget argentine film " lost embrace " -lrb- el abrazo partido -rrb- . directed by german-turkish director fatih akin , " head-on " -lrb- gegen die wand -rrb- tells the story of a marriage of convenience between two turks in hamburg : young sibel , who is trying to escape the influence of her traditional family , and the older and self-destructive cahit . " i love this film , " jury president mcdormand told the reuters new agency .
" it said in a wonderful way so many things that a lot of the other films said as well .
' head-on ' told them in a most powerful and most modern way . " the film beat out 22 other submissions in the competition , which took place over ten days in the german capital .
the festival also included a range of other events such as a short film festival , a section for upcoming art house movies called panorama and screenings of the latest offerings in " german cinema . " german cineman revival the golden bear for " head-on " continues what appears to be the beginnings of a revival of the german film industry , following the international success of " good bye , lenin ! " and the oscar last year for " nowhere in africa . "
it would also seem like berlinale director dieter kosslick 's efforts to use the event to strengthen the position of german cinema around the world is paying off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-turkish director fatih akin .
akin , whose film focusing on the problems of second and third-generation turkish immigrants in germany , said he was pleased he could " make two countries happy at the same time " with the award . after the heavy topic matter of " head-on " - the film has plenty of violence and sadness - akin said he hoped to make a comedy next .
" my best work lies ahead of me , " the 30-year-old said on saturday . although " head-on " had been popular with festival-goers , its win comes as a bit of a surprise since other movies including " before sunset " starring ethan hawke and julie delpy and " ae fond kiss " by british director ken loach had been among the favorites . but its success should n't hurt the berlinale , which will continue to jockey with cannes and venice for glamour and influence among europe 's leading film festivals . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2004 dw-world 's complete berlinale coverage .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

we tried to show the family not as a typical one .
her mother is very modern , even the brother accepts the male hero , even if he is a lump , because he loves her , because it is good for the sister . should immigrants drop their traditions and heritage and integrate in a new society ? the answer is somewhere in between .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

dw-world 's eleonora volodina spoke with him about the film . dw-world : your film is about turkish immigrants in germany .
do you think you have to be turkish to deal with the subject with in such a blunt manner ? fatih akin : i did n't want the characters to represent the whole turkish minority .
they were outsiders in this community .
that interested me from the very beginning .
i did not much think which were the turkish elements .
i was born with it and grew up with it .
i was on the inside and did not reflect upon it that much .
i did it later , not when i was making the movie . still the girl has to fight against her conservative muslim heritage . the girl is crazy somehow .
she wants to kill herself , she is going head on into the wall .
she does not accept the pressure .
there is a certain kind of pressure , a certain kind of dogmatism , that especially turkish females face in our society , here in germany more , than in turkey .
and she is fighting against it .
that was interesting .
sure , she was rebelling , but as an outsider , not as someone typical .
we tried to show the family not as a typical one .
her mother is very modern , even the brother accepts the male hero , even if he is a lump , because he loves her , because it is good for the sister . should immigrants drop their traditions and heritage and integrate in a new society ? the answer is somewhere in between .
me personally , i stand in opposition of tradition , but i am also loyal to tradition .
i don ’ t say everything is wrong .
i don ’ t believe in that .
i would like to keep a lot of stuff from the turkish heritage , some things i would not like to keep because i don ’ t accept them .
i was born in germany , went to german school .
to try to keep the respect – that is very important to me .
that is why it was important to show the family in respectful way . at the end they return to turkey , where their roots are .
is that the only way to find perhaps not happiness but at least some piece and quiet ?
is the message that immigrants can find peace only where they came from ? well , i don ’ t know .
the tricky thing about all the stuff is that the personal home is germany .
she was born in germany .

the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

dw-world 's eleonora volodina spoke with him about the film . dw-world : your film is about turkish immigrants in germany .
do you think you have to be turkish to deal with the subject with in such a blunt manner ? fatih akin : i did n't want the characters to represent the whole turkish minority .
they were outsiders in this community .
that interested me from the very beginning .
i did not much think which were the turkish elements .
i was born with it and grew up with it .
i was on the inside and did not reflect upon it that much .
i did it later , not when i was making the movie . still the girl has to fight against her conservative muslim heritage . the girl is crazy somehow .
she wants to kill herself , she is going head on into the wall .
she does not accept the pressure .
there is a certain kind of pressure , a certain kind of dogmatism , that especially turkish females face in our society , here in germany more , than in turkey .
and she is fighting against it .
that was interesting .
sure , she was rebelling , but as an outsider , not as someone typical .
we tried to show the family not as a typical one .
her mother is very modern , even the brother accepts the male hero , even if he is a lump , because he loves her , because it is good for the sister . should immigrants drop their traditions and heritage and integrate in a new society ? the answer is somewhere in between .
me personally , i stand in opposition of tradition , but i am also loyal to tradition .
i don ’ t say everything is wrong .
i don ’ t believe in that .
i would like to keep a lot of stuff from the turkish heritage , some things i would not like to keep because i don ’ t accept them .
i was born in germany , went to german school .
to try to keep the respect – that is very important to me .
that is why it was important to show the family in respectful way . at the end they return to turkey , where their roots are .
is that the only way to find perhaps not happiness but at least some piece and quiet ?
is the message that immigrants can find peace only where they came from ? well , i don ’ t know .
the tricky thing about all the stuff is that the personal home is germany .
she was born in germany .
he grew up in germany .
he is so german that he does not almost speak turkish anymore .
he does not look even turkish anymore .
they go somehow to a foreign country , or to a new country .
not to their home .
that is a general idea .
they have to escape . starting over ? yes , exactly .
both are on a quest .
he is trying to find himself .
she is trying to find herself .
and the moment when the film stops , it is just the moment , where the film stops .
we don ’ t know what happens next .
do they stay there , do they go away .
she accepts her new life , but we don ’ t know if she is very happy with it .
he goes back to his roots , to the place where his parents come from , where he was born .
but he does not go as a lucky man .
the quest still continues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2004 dw-world 's complete coverage of the berlin film festival .

"
" head-on , " a film by a german-turkish director won the golden bear at the 54th berlin film festival saturday , marking the first time in 18 years that a submission from germany managed to take the berlinale 's top prize . an international jury led by u.s. actress frances mcdormand also awarded south african charlize theron a silver bear for her role in " monster " and uruguay 's daniel hendler won a best actor award for his role as a young jewish architect in the low-budget argentine film " lost embrace " -lrb- el abrazo partido -rrb- . directed by german-turkish director fatih akin , " head-on " -lrb- gegen die wand -rrb- tells the story of a marriage of convenience between two turks in hamburg : young sibel , who is trying to escape the influence of her traditional family , and the older and self-destructive cahit . " i love this film , " jury president mcdormand told the reuters new agency .
" it said in a wonderful way so many things that a lot of the other films said as well .
' head-on ' told them in a most powerful and most modern way . " the film beat out 22 other submissions in the competition , which took place over ten days in the german capital .
the festival also included a range of other events such as a short film festival , a section for upcoming art house movies called panorama and screenings of the latest offerings in " german cinema . " german cineman revival the golden bear for " head-on " continues what appears to be the beginnings of a revival of the german film industry , following the international success of " good bye , lenin ! " and the oscar last year for " nowhere in africa . "
it would also seem like berlinale director dieter kosslick 's efforts to use the event to strengthen the position of german cinema around the world is paying off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-turkish director fatih akin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.02.2004 schröder rejects calls to soften reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder hopes the spd will applaud müntefering .
german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

dw-world 's eleonora volodina spoke with him about the film . dw-world : your film is about turkish immigrants in germany .
do you think you have to be turkish to deal with the subject with in such a blunt manner ? fatih akin : i did n't want the characters to represent the whole turkish minority .
they were outsiders in this community .
that interested me from the very beginning .
i did not much think which were the turkish elements .
i was born with it and grew up with it .
i was on the inside and did not reflect upon it that much .
i did it later , not when i was making the movie . still the girl has to fight against her conservative muslim heritage . the girl is crazy somehow .
she wants to kill herself , she is going head on into the wall .
she does not accept the pressure .
there is a certain kind of pressure , a certain kind of dogmatism , that especially turkish females face in our society , here in germany more , than in turkey .
and she is fighting against it .
that was interesting .
sure , she was rebelling , but as an outsider , not as someone typical .
we tried to show the family not as a typical one .
her mother is very modern , even the brother accepts the male hero , even if he is a lump , because he loves her , because it is good for the sister . should immigrants drop their traditions and heritage and integrate in a new society ? the answer is somewhere in between .
me personally , i stand in opposition of tradition , but i am also loyal to tradition .
i don ’ t say everything is wrong .
i don ’ t believe in that .
i would like to keep a lot of stuff from the turkish heritage , some things i would not like to keep because i don ’ t accept them .
i was born in germany , went to german school .
to try to keep the respect – that is very important to me .
that is why it was important to show the family in respectful way . at the end they return to turkey , where their roots are .
is that the only way to find perhaps not happiness but at least some piece and quiet ?
is the message that immigrants can find peace only where they came from ? well , i don ’ t know .
the tricky thing about all the stuff is that the personal home is germany .
she was born in germany .
he grew up in germany .
he is so german that he does not almost speak turkish anymore .
he does not look even turkish anymore .
they go somehow to a foreign country , or to a new country .
not to their home .
that is a general idea .
they have to escape . starting over ? yes , exactly .
both are on a quest .
he is trying to find himself .
she is trying to find herself .
and the moment when the film stops , it is just the moment , where the film stops .
we don ’ t know what happens next .
do they stay there , do they go away .
she accepts her new life , but we don ’ t know if she is very happy with it .
he goes back to his roots , to the place where his parents come from , where he was born .
but he does not go as a lucky man .
the quest still continues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2004 dw-world 's complete coverage of the berlin film festival .

her mother is very modern , even the brother accepts the male hero , even if he is a lump , because he loves her , because it is good for the sister . should immigrants drop their traditions and heritage and integrate in a new society ? the answer is somewhere in between .

is that the only way to find perhaps not happiness but at least some piece and quiet ?
is the message that immigrants can find peace only where they came from ? well , i don ’ t know .
the tricky thing about all the stuff is that the personal home is germany .

he is so german that he does not almost speak turkish anymore .

that is a general idea .
they have to escape . starting over ? yes , exactly .
both are on a quest .
he is trying to find himself .
she is trying to find herself .
and the moment when the film stops , it is just the moment , where the film stops .
we don ’ t know what happens next .
do they stay there , do they go away .
she accepts her new life , but we don ’ t know if she is very happy with it .
he goes back to his roots , to the place where his parents come from , where he was born .

dw-world 's eleonora volodina spoke with him about the film . dw-world : your film is about turkish immigrants in germany .
do you think you have to be turkish to deal with the subject with in such a blunt manner ? fatih akin : i did n't want the characters to represent the whole turkish minority .
they were outsiders in this community .
that interested me from the very beginning .
i did not much think which were the turkish elements .
i was born with it and grew up with it .
i was on the inside and did not reflect upon it that much .
i did it later , not when i was making the movie . still the girl has to fight against her conservative muslim heritage . the girl is crazy somehow .
she wants to kill herself , she is going head on into the wall .
she does not accept the pressure .
there is a certain kind of pressure , a certain kind of dogmatism , that especially turkish females face in our society , here in germany more , than in turkey .
and she is fighting against it .
that was interesting .
sure , she was rebelling , but as an outsider , not as someone typical .
we tried to show the family not as a typical one .
her mother is very modern , even the brother accepts the male hero , even if he is a lump , because he loves her , because it is good for the sister . should immigrants drop their traditions and heritage and integrate in a new society ? the answer is somewhere in between .
me personally , i stand in opposition of tradition , but i am also loyal to tradition .
i don ’ t say everything is wrong .
i don ’ t believe in that .
i would like to keep a lot of stuff from the turkish heritage , some things i would not like to keep because i don ’ t accept them .
i was born in germany , went to german school .
to try to keep the respect – that is very important to me .
that is why it was important to show the family in respectful way . at the end they return to turkey , where their roots are .
is that the only way to find perhaps not happiness but at least some piece and quiet ?
is the message that immigrants can find peace only where they came from ? well , i don ’ t know .
the tricky thing about all the stuff is that the personal home is germany .
she was born in germany .
he grew up in germany .
he is so german that he does not almost speak turkish anymore .
he does not look even turkish anymore .
they go somehow to a foreign country , or to a new country .
not to their home .
that is a general idea .
they have to escape . starting over ? yes , exactly .
both are on a quest .
he is trying to find himself .
she is trying to find herself .
and the moment when the film stops , it is just the moment , where the film stops .
we don ’ t know what happens next .
do they stay there , do they go away .
she accepts her new life , but we don ’ t know if she is very happy with it .
he goes back to his roots , to the place where his parents come from , where he was born .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

" i love this film , " jury president mcdormand told the reuters new agency .
" it said in a wonderful way so many things that a lot of the other films said as well .

dw-world 's eleonora volodina spoke with him about the film . dw-world : your film is about turkish immigrants in germany .
do you think you have to be turkish to deal with the subject with in such a blunt manner ? fatih akin : i did n't want the characters to represent the whole turkish minority .
they were outsiders in this community .
that interested me from the very beginning .
i did not much think which were the turkish elements .
i was born with it and grew up with it .
i was on the inside and did not reflect upon it that much .
i did it later , not when i was making the movie . still the girl has to fight against her conservative muslim heritage . the girl is crazy somehow .
she wants to kill herself , she is going head on into the wall .
she does not accept the pressure .
there is a certain kind of pressure , a certain kind of dogmatism , that especially turkish females face in our society , here in germany more , than in turkey .
and she is fighting against it .
that was interesting .
sure , she was rebelling , but as an outsider , not as someone typical .
we tried to show the family not as a typical one .
her mother is very modern , even the brother accepts the male hero , even if he is a lump , because he loves her , because it is good for the sister . should immigrants drop their traditions and heritage and integrate in a new society ? the answer is somewhere in between .
me personally , i stand in opposition of tradition , but i am also loyal to tradition .
i don ’ t say everything is wrong .
i don ’ t believe in that .
i would like to keep a lot of stuff from the turkish heritage , some things i would not like to keep because i don ’ t accept them .
i was born in germany , went to german school .
to try to keep the respect – that is very important to me .
that is why it was important to show the family in respectful way . at the end they return to turkey , where their roots are .
is that the only way to find perhaps not happiness but at least some piece and quiet ?
is the message that immigrants can find peace only where they came from ? well , i don ’ t know .
the tricky thing about all the stuff is that the personal home is germany .
she was born in germany .
he grew up in germany .
he is so german that he does not almost speak turkish anymore .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2004 berlin goes berlinale lord of the films germany boosts profile of home-grown filmmakers abroad young film makers gather at talent campus culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.02.2004 interview with fatih akin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-turkish director faith akin 's " head-on " -lrb- gegen die wand -rrb- took home the berlinale 's golden bear on saturday .
dw-world 's eleonora volodina spoke with him about the film . dw-world : your film is about turkish immigrants in germany .
do you think you have to be turkish to deal with the subject with in such a blunt manner ? fatih akin : i did n't want the characters to represent the whole turkish minority .
they were outsiders in this community .
that interested me from the very beginning .
i did not much think which were the turkish elements .
i was born with it and grew up with it .
i was on the inside and did not reflect upon it that much .
i did it later , not when i was making the movie . still the girl has to fight against her conservative muslim heritage . the girl is crazy somehow .
she wants to kill herself , she is going head on into the wall .
she does not accept the pressure .
there is a certain kind of pressure , a certain kind of dogmatism , that especially turkish females face in our society , here in germany more , than in turkey .
and she is fighting against it .
that was interesting .
sure , she was rebelling , but as an outsider , not as someone typical .
we tried to show the family not as a typical one .
her mother is very modern , even the brother accepts the male hero , even if he is a lump , because he loves her , because it is good for the sister . should immigrants drop their traditions and heritage and integrate in a new society ? the answer is somewhere in between .
me personally , i stand in opposition of tradition , but i am also loyal to tradition .
i don ’ t say everything is wrong .
i don ’ t believe in that .
i would like to keep a lot of stuff from the turkish heritage , some things i would not like to keep because i don ’ t accept them .
i was born in germany , went to german school .
to try to keep the respect – that is very important to me .
that is why it was important to show the family in respectful way . at the end they return to turkey , where their roots are .
is that the only way to find perhaps not happiness but at least some piece and quiet ?
is the message that immigrants can find peace only where they came from ? well , i don ’ t know .
the tricky thing about all the stuff is that the personal home is germany .
she was born in germany .
he grew up in germany .
he is so german that he does not almost speak turkish anymore .
he does not look even turkish anymore .
they go somehow to a foreign country , or to a new country .
not to their home .
that is a general idea .
they have to escape . starting over ? yes , exactly .
both are on a quest .
he is trying to find himself .
she is trying to find herself .
and the moment when the film stops , it is just the moment , where the film stops .
we don ’ t know what happens next .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.02.2004 schröder rejects calls to soften reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder hopes the spd will applaud müntefering .
german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

dw-world 's eleonora volodina spoke with him about the film . dw-world : your film is about turkish immigrants in germany .
do you think you have to be turkish to deal with the subject with in such a blunt manner ? fatih akin : i did n't want the characters to represent the whole turkish minority .
they were outsiders in this community .
that interested me from the very beginning .
i did not much think which were the turkish elements .
i was born with it and grew up with it .
i was on the inside and did not reflect upon it that much .
i did it later , not when i was making the movie . still the girl has to fight against her conservative muslim heritage . the girl is crazy somehow .
she wants to kill herself , she is going head on into the wall .
she does not accept the pressure .
there is a certain kind of pressure , a certain kind of dogmatism , that especially turkish females face in our society , here in germany more , than in turkey .
and she is fighting against it .
that was interesting .
sure , she was rebelling , but as an outsider , not as someone typical .
we tried to show the family not as a typical one .
her mother is very modern , even the brother accepts the male hero , even if he is a lump , because he loves her , because it is good for the sister . should immigrants drop their traditions and heritage and integrate in a new society ? the answer is somewhere in between .
me personally , i stand in opposition of tradition , but i am also loyal to tradition .
i don ’ t say everything is wrong .
i don ’ t believe in that .
i would like to keep a lot of stuff from the turkish heritage , some things i would not like to keep because i don ’ t accept them .
i was born in germany , went to german school .
to try to keep the respect – that is very important to me .
that is why it was important to show the family in respectful way . at the end they return to turkey , where their roots are .
is that the only way to find perhaps not happiness but at least some piece and quiet ?
is the message that immigrants can find peace only where they came from ? well , i don ’ t know .
the tricky thing about all the stuff is that the personal home is germany .
she was born in germany .
he grew up in germany .
he is so german that he does not almost speak turkish anymore .
he does not look even turkish anymore .
they go somehow to a foreign country , or to a new country .
not to their home .
that is a general idea .
they have to escape . starting over ? yes , exactly .
both are on a quest .
he is trying to find himself .
she is trying to find herself .
and the moment when the film stops , it is just the moment , where the film stops .
we don ’ t know what happens next .
do they stay there , do they go away .
she accepts her new life , but we don ’ t know if she is very happy with it .
he goes back to his roots , to the place where his parents come from , where he was born .
but he does not go as a lucky man .
the quest still continues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2004 dw-world 's complete coverage of the berlin film festival .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday defended his reform course at a regional party congress of his social democrats , rejecting calls that the government 's welfare cuts were jeopardizing the party 's future . speaking at a regional social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- congress in bochum in the state of north rhine-westphalia , schröder said he knew reforms to germany 's social security system were " painful , " but contended the party was " on the right path . " " it 's has been worthwhile to undertake and support these policies and it will continue to be worthwhile , " schröder said in a speech to 450 party delegates .
" i ask you to help make them work . " the spd has wallowed near all-time lows in opinion polls for months as the government attempts to overhaul germany 's creaky welfare system and rigid labor market .
facing the party faithful in north rhine-westphalia - long a bastion of support for the spd - schröder 's appearance in bochum is likely to be seen as a litmus test of his decision last week to step down as spd party chairman . schröder is thought to have made the move to appease internal party critics unhappy with the direction of the government 's reforms .
however , instead of quelling the discontentment with the change at the top of the spd , calls from the left are growing louder for the berlin to change tack and rectify what they see as socially-unbalanced reforms . pressure from the left members of both the spd and the greens - schröder 's junior coalition member - are urging a rethink of the chancellor 's so-called " agenda 2010 " package of social cuts and labor reforms . many in the spd want to ease the burden on ordinary people who are now left paying more for health services and making do with reduced unemployment and social benefits .
the greens are pushing for a reintroduction of the wealth tax that will see richer people paying more into the government 's coffers .
both initiatives have been generally backed by the country 's trade unions . " the german unions will apply an incredible amount of pressure to ensure the reform process in the future heads in a different direction , " michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation , told die welt newspaper on saturday . but schröder 's designated successor as spd party chairman , franz müntefering , in bochum affirmed his intention to stay the government 's reform course , saying there was no alternative to pressing ahead with schröder 's agenda 2010 . " we are in total agreement on all points , " said müntefering , who is expected to confirmed as chairman on march 21 at a special party congress .

the new lovespoons have been made for same sex couples who want to make a loving gesture on the most romantic day of the year .

the custom of carving and giving welsh lovespoons dates back to the 17th century .
originally , they were made by young men as a token of their love and affection for their girlfriends .
however , mr smith thinks it is time the tradition moved into the 21st century .
his latest wooden lovespoons have two intertwined gender symbols to denote the gay and lesbian versions .

" amid some scandal and innuendo , their relationship blossomed and they were visited by writers and intellectuals including wordsworth , edmund burke and sir walter scott .
" although nobody knows for certain whether their relationship was a sexual one , the ladies of llangollen are revered today as icons for the lesbian and gay community . "
the idea has also been greeted enthusiastically by the lesbian and gay magazine , fyne times .

" although nobody knows for certain whether their relationship was a sexual one , the ladies of llangollen are revered today as icons for the lesbian and gay community . "
the idea has also been greeted enthusiastically by the lesbian and gay magazine , fyne times .
" it 's wonderful that something like this has been directed at same sex couples , " said the magazine 's spokeswoman jill rayner .
" i think these lovespoons are really going to take off , " she added .

the mast was taken down from the campus at the university of wales aberystwyth last summer and placed on land owned by welsh water , 200 metres away from 1,200-pupil penglais school .
but temporary planning permission , which allowed the mast to stand until a new one replaced it , ended on 29 january .
mast owner o2 said it was talking to planners and the new mast would go up soon .
welsh water should do the honourable thing by terminating their contracts with these companies paul james , penglais school governor however , county councillor and school governor paul james and welsh water want the temporary mast taken down .
" the jury is still out about this subject because there is still no conclusive evidence to say these masts are a danger to the general public , " said mr james .
densely populated " but while ongoing research into effects on humans is still being carried out there are many uncertainties , so i feel these masts should not be erected in densely populated areas . "
welsh water receives £ 11,000 a year for all masts sited at the cefn llan site , with £ 5,000 due to the siting of the new tetra mast .
mr james said : " welsh water should do the honourable thing by terminating their contracts with these companies .
a welsh water spokesman said : " we have instructed our agent that unless there are grounds for a planning appeal the mast should be removed from the site at the earliest practical opportunity . "
the mast is based 200 metres from penglais secondary school john evans , senior planning officer with ceredigion council , said the local authority would have to decide if it was expedient to enforce the breach of planning control .
he added that several factors , including the loss of mobile phone coverage for o2 mobile phone users , would have to be taken into consideration .
angela johnson of o2 said the company was aware that planning permission for the existing mast had expired .
she added : " we are now in discussion with planners about our next move but the new mast is expected to be erected in the next couple of weeks . "
the new mast will be used to transmit mobile phone signals for t-mobile and orange , as well as the new police radio system tetra run by o2 .

no , we are not watching porn , we are playing multiplayer halo .
you have to admit , it is mighty impressive that a game released two years ago still gets this much attention .
true , it was hailed as a masterpiece on its release , but only a true classic has this sort of enduring appeal .
frag with friends games from the " golden age " , like pac-man , space invaders and simple addictive games like tetris , as well as pc games like counter-strike which generate entire communities , have long-lasting appeal .

there is something genuinely special about a gathering for some offline multiplay , replete with booze , snacks and stream of banter discuss this story on bbci collective personally , i pick up resident evil titles intermittently , and my house of the dead on dreamcast will always have a role , but unique high quality titles with true longevity are rare .
only those that have received absolute critical acclaim seem to hold their appeal - ico , rez , shenmue maybe , the legend of zelda : ocarina of time .
but when a game is a single-player , narrative-based affair , inevitably that appeal can wane .
it could be argued only obsessives play repeatedly to discover every item , nook and cranny .
originally , halo 's multiplayer options were somewhat undervalued in favour of its compelling single-player story , but today they maintain its appeal .
you have all the elements of the much-loved adventure you probably completed a few years ago , like visuals and control system , but you can simply dip into this world in a much more disposable , quick-fix manner - fragging with your friends .
two years spent with the title give it warmth and familiarity like an old sofa - there is something comforting about donning the master chief 's armour once more .

i am increasingly an exponent of online multiplayer gaming , and my obsession with sony 's pc landmark planetside - a game i came to because i thought the screenshots had a resemblance to halo - is on record .
but there is something genuinely special about a gathering for some offline multiplay , replete with booze , snacks and stream of banter , by turns good-natured , competitive , foul and surprisingly witty .

no , we are not watching porn , we are playing multiplayer halo .
you have to admit , it is mighty impressive that a game released two years ago still gets this much attention .
true , it was hailed as a masterpiece on its release , but only a true classic has this sort of enduring appeal .
frag with friends games from the " golden age " , like pac-man , space invaders and simple addictive games like tetris , as well as pc games like counter-strike which generate entire communities , have long-lasting appeal .

the men smashed windows of the red dragon pub on wrexham 's caia park estate because they believed men who had savagely beaten up one of their friends were in the bar .
the attack resulted in a pitched battle in the road outside , followed the next night by a mob of 200 people attacking police who had been called in to calm tensions .
what had gone on before was no excuse for what you did , although it is clear and powerful mitigation judge roger dutton a total of 31 people were jailed last year for their part in the disturbances in june 2003 .
judge roger dutton , sitting at mold crown court , told the defendants that they had participated in a " disgraceful exhibition of violence " but he accepted that there were mitigating circumstances .
three defendants were sentenced to eight months in jail , three received four months , and one received three months .
two other iraqis were given conditional discharges .
judge dutton said the men had been provoked by a serious attack on one of their community by unknown men and that he was he was sure people on caia park knew who the attackers were but were too afraid to come forward .
the pub was wrecked in the attack by the iraqi kurdish men the court heard how most of the defendants had been forced to flee iraq because of beatings and torture , and had wanted to live peacefully in north wales .
the hearing was told the men wrongly believed that the police were doing nothing after their friend received head injuries after being badly beaten up on the banks of the river gwenfro by local men , and felt provoked to act as they did .
judge dutton said : " it is also clear that there was a relatively tense atmosphere in that area of the town which boiled over that night .
" there was among many a misplaced feeling of resistance that you , as newcomers in the area , were receiving some favourable treatment .
" unfortunately , a hard core criminal element involved themselves in a serious physical attack on one of your countrymen .
he was clearly very badly hurt .
terrified children " those who are responsible , whether they be free men or undergoing sentences of this court for other offences , know perfectly well who they are . "
the judge said he understood that the defendants felt provoked by the attack on their friend , and he accepted that they were all hard-working and of previous good character .
but he said that could never justify the attack on the pub , where many innocent people , including women and children , had been terrified .
one of the defendants , sadiq faraj , had been arrested wielding a weapon before the attack but the rest launched their assault after the police had gone .
judge dutton said : " what had gone on before was no excuse for what you did , although it is clear and powerful mitigation . "
affray defendants hawbash ahmed , 22 , omar mohammed , 26 , and goran tahir , 20 , each received eight months .
yadgar ahmed , 27 , adnan hassan , 27 , and ari karim -lrb- 21 -rrb- , were given four months each .
all admitted affray .
sadiq faraj -lrb- 19 -rrb- was given three months .
both he and riben kamaran , 22 , and hamad ahmed , 27 , admitted threatening behaviour .
kamaran and ahmed were given a conditional discharge on the basis that they were present but had no weapons and took no part in violence .
north wales police chief superintendent phil thomson said more people are expected in court as a result of the disturbances on caia park .

ostensibly the argument is about the failure of some of the order 's 120 delegates to the ulster unionist ruling council to pay their annual fees , reckoned to be around £ 60 per delegate .
the financial row comes against a backdrop of growing disagreement between a party and an order which once spoke with one voice ulster unionist officials reckon the order should have no representation without taxation , and some suggested that the order 's presence at this march 's annual general meeting should be cut to as few as 50 .

but it must be especially difficult to be sorting out your matrimonial and financial difficulties on the eve of st valentine 's day .
so it was that the ulster unionist chairman james cooper arrived at the orange order 's headquarters in east belfast on friday to discuss a row about outstanding fees .
afterwards both mr cooper and the senior orangemen he met described their discussions as amicable .
amicable , presumably , in the sense that a divorcing couple can choose to be grown up about things .
ostensibly the argument is about the failure of some of the order 's 120 delegates to the ulster unionist ruling council to pay their annual fees , reckoned to be around £ 60 per delegate .
the financial row comes against a backdrop of growing disagreement between a party and an order which once spoke with one voice ulster unionist officials reckon the order should have no representation without taxation , and some suggested that the order 's presence at this march 's annual general meeting should be cut to as few as 50 .
the orangemen are not the only delegates understood to be in arrears - a similar warning was issued to four constituency associations .
' rewind a few decades ' to portray this as a dispute over loose change , however , would be to miss the point .
it would be like treating a couple 's argument over their joint record collection as being merely a divergence in musical taste .
the financial row comes against a backdrop of growing disagreement between a party and an order which once spoke with one voice .
but when mr trimble began steering the ulster unionists in a new direction in the wake of the good friday agreement , the joint front crumbled rewind a few decades and unionist leaders made no secret of the fact that the two organisations were two sides of the same british coin .
in the 1930s , the then stormont prime minister lord craigavon famously boasted : " i am an orangeman first and a protestant and a member of parliament afterwards . "
that umbilical link between the party and the order remained crucial until recent times .
in 1995 , david trimble owed his elevation from junior mp to party leader to his tough stance over the order 's drumcree parade .
but when mr trimble began steering the ulster unionists in a new direction in the wake of the good friday agreement , the joint front crumbled .
' become alienated ' these days , many in the upper echelons of the orange order tend to be more sympathetic to the dup than to the ulster unionists .
the grandmaster , robert saulters , signed ian paisley 's nomination papers in the run up to last november 's assembly election .
the order 's grand secretary , denis watson , was a dup candidate .
some orangemen believe the dispute over fees is a cover for a purge - 70 fewer orange delegates would almost certainly be 70 fewer anti-trimble votes this month , the dup held a reception and briefing for senior orangemen and other representatives of the loyal orders at stormont .
the dup deputy leader , peter robinson , declared his party did not intend to repeat david trimble 's mistakes in allowing itself to become alienated from the wider unionist community .
against this backdrop , the status of the orange order as an affiliated body of the ulster unionist party , and their bloc vote at crucial meetings of the 900-strong ruling council , looks ever more difficult to fathom .
the ulster unionist leadership has been talking for years about the need to reform the relationship between the two organisations .
but in the past they have never had the necessary two thirds of the vote to change their rules .
now an internal ulster unionist group has been working on various rule changes .
there are rumours that these could be put to an extraordinary meeting of the council on the eve of the agm which is set for 27 march .
some orangemen believe the dispute over fees is a cover for a purge - 70 fewer orange delegates would almost certainly be 70 fewer anti-trimble votes .
but , as with many divorces , there are the children to think about - in this case unionist voters .
the uup does not want to be seen to expel the order - it would probably prefer it to jump .
the order itself may decide that in the long term it should not be tied to any particular party .
if things are not handled delicately the row could end up in the courts - and as divorcees will tell you , if that happens , the only winners are the lawyers .

the advertising supremo said it was a " chronic injustice " for those below the poverty line to pay income tax but added it was not his decision to make .
lord saatchi spoke to the guardian in an interview to mark michael howard 's first 100 days as conservative leader .
lord heseltine , the former conservative deputy prime minister , said mr howard had made the party a " fighting force " .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " the morale in the tory party has been dramatically changed from one of absolute despair and hopelessness to one in which it is now a fighting force anxious to be led .
" michael howard has shown the sophistication to rebalance the party in a way that is designed to lead a united party and to lead it from the centre . "
he said the government " almost certainly lied " on iraq and had introduced stealth taxes depite promising not to increase tax .
no promise earlier lord saatchi told the guardian the tax issue had irked him when he was tory treasury spokesman .
he said : " i came across what i saw as a chronic injustice , which was that poor people pay more tax than rich people .
that strikes me as not right . "
the co-chairman has spoken before about taxing the poor , when he contributed to a 2001 report entitled poor people !
stop paying tax .
like all policies in the manifesto , that will be michael 's decision lord saatchi conservative co-chairman at the time he called for the income tax threshold to be raised from the then figure of £ 4,385 to £ 10,000 .
but in his interview with the guardian he did not offer a concrete pledge of a cut for those on low incomes .
" it is a possibility .
but like all policies in the manifesto , that will be michael 's decision . "
mr howard has argued against high taxes , saying they have a negative effect on people .
in his recent " british dream " speech , he said : " when taxes rise too high , they start to bring people low .
" there is a moral reason for government to take less from people in taxation .
" if people are highly taxed , they come to believe that their obligations to society and to one another are discharged just by handing money over to the government . "
' no idea ' but cabinet office minister douglas alexander dismissed lord saatchi 's comments on taxation .
he said : " every time they open their mouths they make another uncosted commitment .
no one will believe the tories ' opportunistic claims until they show how they will be paid for .
" this latest idea that the tories have failed to provide a cost for would in fact cost £ 30bn and the tories have no idea how they would pay for it .
" and far from helping poorer families the tories voted against the national minimum wage and would scrap our tax credits , which are helping six million low and middle income families . "

more than a year after being captured by us troops fighting members of the taleban and al-qaeda , naqibullah , 13 , is back home in eastern afghanistan .
naqibullah wants compensation to pay for a medical education he spent much of his time in captivity in camp iguana , the children 's section of the us detention centre on the tropical island of cuba .
the teenager said he felt fine and was happy to tell his story .
he had never even been to kabul , let alone outside afghanistan , before he was taken prisoner by the americans .
" i had n't done anything , but they suspected me because i was standing next to some men who had guns , " he said .
" i told them i was innocent .
i do n't even know how to use a gun . "
' guest treatment ' unlike most of those in guantanamo bay , he was not forced to wear an orange boiler suit , or shackled and hooded .
he behaves better with his sisters and brothers , he shows me more respect mohammed gul , naqibullah 's father inside guantanamo in fact , apart from the two other boys released with him , he says he saw no other detainees .
he even says he was treated like a guest of the us forces .
" we were not like prisoners there .
we were not tortured .
they did n't tie our hands .
and they gave us education , " he said .
there is no bitterness or anger , but the boy learned enough english to make this one demand of the americans : " i want the americans to pay me because i was not a criminal .
i want them to help me become a doctor . "
life changed after more than a year in us custody , naqibullah is now trying to adjust to life back home in his village .
it is hard to exaggerate just what a strange and unsettling experience this has been for him , but this is perhaps not the guantanamo bay story you might expect .
at the mosque , naqibullah 's father , gul mohammed , leads prayers .
his attitude shows the very different culture and mindset here .
naqibullah may face difficulties adjusting back to village life you might think he would be angry with the americans .
actually he thinks they have done naqibullah a favour .
" he has learnt to speak english .
he has come back with an education .
he knows about things , " gul mohammed said .
" he behaves better with his sisters and brothers , he shows me more respect , and he has been to big places like kabul , and the rest of the world . "
but it could be difficult for naqibullah now .
as i leave his village , he says : " i want to go to the city . "

the advertising supremo said it was a " chronic injustice " for those below the poverty line to pay income tax but added it was not his decision to make .
lord saatchi spoke to the guardian in an interview to mark michael howard 's first 100 days as conservative leader .
lord heseltine , the former conservative deputy prime minister , said mr howard had made the party a " fighting force " .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " the morale in the tory party has been dramatically changed from one of absolute despair and hopelessness to one in which it is now a fighting force anxious to be led .
" michael howard has shown the sophistication to rebalance the party in a way that is designed to lead a united party and to lead it from the centre . "
he said the government " almost certainly lied " on iraq and had introduced stealth taxes depite promising not to increase tax .
no promise earlier lord saatchi told the guardian the tax issue had irked him when he was tory treasury spokesman .
he said : " i came across what i saw as a chronic injustice , which was that poor people pay more tax than rich people .
that strikes me as not right . "
the co-chairman has spoken before about taxing the poor , when he contributed to a 2001 report entitled poor people !
stop paying tax . "
like all policies in the manifesto , that will be michael 's decision " lord saatchi conservative co-chairman at the time he called for the income tax threshold to be raised from the then figure of £ 4,385 to £ 10,000 .
but in his interview with the guardian he did not offer a concrete pledge of a cut for those on low incomes .
" it is a possibility .
but like all policies in the manifesto , that will be michael 's decision . "
mr howard has argued against high taxes , saying they have a negative effect on people .
in his recent " british dream " speech , he said : " when taxes rise too high , they start to bring people low .
" there is a moral reason for government to take less from people in taxation .
" if people are highly taxed , they come to believe that their obligations to society and to one another are discharged just by handing money over to the government . "
' no idea ' but cabinet office minister douglas alexander dismissed lord saatchi 's comments on taxation .
he said : " every time they open their mouths they make another uncosted commitment .
no one will believe the tories ' opportunistic claims until they show how they will be paid for .

ever since the beginning of the 16th century antwerp has been the world 's diamond-cutting capital .
over half the world 's diamonds are traded in the belgian city 's gem district , a maze of streets close to the train station .
diamond merchants in antwerp have a combined annual turnover of $ 23 billion .
rough diamonds arrive from all over the world and are placed in vaults as deals are done .

on the weekend of 15/16 february 2003 , as the city 's attention was distracted by the diamond games tennis tournament - won by venus williams - the antwerp diamond centre became the scene of the biggest gem robbery in history .
the raid is believed to have been carried out by a gang of veteran italian robbers , known as the school of turin .
the gang managed to bypass cameras , bars and 12-inch thick reinforced doors to gain entry to the vaults .
joris van der aa , a journalist with the antwerp newspaper het laatste nieuws , said : " they had copies of the keys made to get in ; they bypassed the alarm system and they replaced the cctv tapes so it made it look as if nothing was going on inside the vault .
these guys never use violence .
they are brilliant with keys and alarm systems and do n't need to resort to violence joris van der aa antwerp journalist " these guys never use violence .
they are brilliant with keys and alarm systems and do n't need to resort to violence . "
mr van der aa said : " it was the perfect crime .
these guys are professionals .
most of them are quite old and they all have these nicknames .
one is called the king of thieves , another one is known as the magician with the keys . "
after prying open 123 vaults they were so loaded down they gave up on the remaining 37 .
one diamond dealer told bbc news online : " there has never been such a robbery in the history of the trade in antwerp and everybody was over-confident about security . "
bags dumped in ditch the police got their best lead when they found several discarded bags in a ditch beside the main road out of antwerp .
inside was , among other things , a half-eaten sandwich .
police say they obtained vital dna left behind by one of the robbers .
the vault was ransacked the man facing trial over the theft is leonardo notarbartolo , who had rented an office in the antwerp diamond centre in november 2000 .
antwerp 's director of judicial services , eric sack , said mr notarbartolo worked as a diamond merchant in the centre and paid several visits to the vault deep underground .
mr notarbartolo , 51 , is not believed to have taken part in the actual robbery itself but he has been charged with serious theft , membership of a criminal group , use of false keys and false documents .
the wheels of belgian justice turn slowly and his trial is thought to be some way off .
the alleged leader of the gang , antonino finotto , is believed to be in italy .
his dna was allegedly found inside the vault .
search led to italy not long after the heist belgian detectives contacted their counterparts in turin .
mr van der aa takes up the story : " italian police searched offices in turin and found a few diamonds in a safe .
they had certificates -lrb- of authenticity -rrb- with them .
keys were copied to gain entry " they photographed the diamonds and sent the pictures to the police in antwerp .
" antwerp police believed they were from the heist and two weeks later they went to italy to take back the diamonds .
but when they opened the safe they were all gone . "
will the antwerp diamonds ever be found ?
london diamond dealer michel einhorn , whose aunt was among the victims of the robbery , said he understood most of the diamonds which were taken were already cut and polished .
he told bbc news online : " some would have been laser inscribed , but not all of them , and even if they are that can be removed . "
unfortunately there a few places in london , antwerp and amsterdam , with an unsavoury reputation .
there will always people willing to buy these diamonds michel einhorn mr einhorn , who has a shop in hatton garden , said : " reputable dealers will not buy diamonds from anyone without checking them out .
" but unfortunately there a few places around here , and in antwerp and amsterdam , with an unsavoury reputation .
there will always be people willing to buy these diamonds . "
so how can the average person know if the diamond ring they are buying was made with a stolen stone ?
mr einhorn said : " it 's like buying anything .
if you buy it in a pub from a guy whole looks dodgy then that 's your look out .
but if you buy it from a reputable trader , for example someone who is a member of the london diamond bourse , you 're pretty safe . "

these guys never use violence .

they are brilliant with keys and alarm systems and do n't need to resort to violence . "
mr van der aa said : " it was the perfect crime .
these guys are professionals .
most of them are quite old and they all have these nicknames .
one is called the king of thieves , another one is known as the magician with the keys . "
after prying open 123 vaults they were so loaded down they gave up on the remaining 37 .
one diamond dealer told bbc news online : " there has never been such a robbery in the history of the trade in antwerp and everybody was over-confident about security . "
bags dumped in ditch the police got their best lead when they found several discarded bags in a ditch beside the main road out of antwerp .
inside was , among other things , a half-eaten sandwich .
police say they obtained vital dna left behind by one of the robbers .
the vault was ransacked the man facing trial over the theft is leonardo notarbartolo , who had rented an office in the antwerp diamond centre in november 2000 .
antwerp 's director of judicial services , eric sack , said mr notarbartolo worked as a diamond merchant in the centre and paid several visits to the vault deep underground .
mr notarbartolo , 51 , is not believed to have taken part in the actual robbery itself but he has been charged with serious theft , membership of a criminal group , use of false keys and false documents .
the wheels of belgian justice turn slowly and his trial is thought to be some way off .
the alleged leader of the gang , antonino finotto , is believed to be in italy .
his dna was allegedly found inside the vault .
search led to italy not long after the heist belgian detectives contacted their counterparts in turin .
mr van der aa takes up the story : " italian police searched offices in turin and found a few diamonds in a safe .
they had certificates -lrb- of authenticity -rrb- with them .
keys were copied to gain entry " they photographed the diamonds and sent the pictures to the police in antwerp .
" antwerp police believed they were from the heist and two weeks later they went to italy to take back the diamonds .
but when they opened the safe they were all gone . "
will the antwerp diamonds ever be found ?
london diamond dealer michel einhorn , whose aunt was among the victims of the robbery , said he understood most of the diamonds which were taken were already cut and polished .
he told bbc news online : " some would have been laser inscribed , but not all of them , and even if they are that can be removed . "
unfortunately there a few places in london , antwerp and amsterdam , with an unsavoury reputation .
there will always people willing to buy these diamonds michel einhorn mr einhorn , who has a shop in hatton garden , said : " reputable dealers will not buy diamonds from anyone without checking them out .
" but unfortunately there a few places around here , and in antwerp and amsterdam , with an unsavoury reputation .
there will always be people willing to buy these diamonds . "
so how can the average person know if the diamond ring they are buying was made with a stolen stone ?
mr einhorn said : " it 's like buying anything .
if you buy it in a pub from a guy whole looks dodgy then that 's your look out .
but if you buy it from a reputable trader , for example someone who is a member of the london diamond bourse , you 're pretty safe . "

shepway district council had been asked to grant a licence for the premises , which was earmarked for a former children 's shop opposite a funfair .
however , playtime - the company behind the scheme - has now decided to look for premises in a larger town .
owner steve taylor said he had only wanted to offer people a choice .
i think dymchurch is quite backward in its thinking steve taylor but residents had felt the choice of location was not suitable for the small seaside town , which attracts families with young children throughout the year .
parish council chairman tom gibbs said the shop would have been situated literally in the centre of the high street directly opposite a children 's funfair , and a small indoor area geared to children for leisure use .
mr taylor said he had not wanted to cause problems , but while accepting there had been a lot of strong feelings against his proposal , he disputed the fact that locals classed the area as a " children 's paradise " .
" at the end of the day dymchurch is an area of decline , " he told bbc news online .
' bit of fun ' " it may have been a children 's paradise about 20 years ago but the half a dozen or so shops there are pretty tacky , " he said .
mr taylor said he had only wanted to " add a bit of sparkle " to the area , and offer a " bit of fun " for adults in their own home .
" the majority of customers are couples - what 's wrong with them buying a toy , or a video or a dvd for use in their own time ? "
he disputed the suggestion that sex shops were seedy .
" i think dymchurch is quite backward in its thinking , " he said .
