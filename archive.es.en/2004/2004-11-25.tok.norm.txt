a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the chinese be persuaded to part with their hard earned yuan for private health insurance ?
picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .
providing the initial entry into the market is successful , it is hoped that a role out of the service could occur across china . kateri jochum -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform after drastic cost-cutting steps imposed earlier this year , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- aim to expand the revenue basis for the national health service .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the chinese be persuaded to part with their hard earned yuan for private health insurance ?
picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .
providing the initial entry into the market is successful , it is hoped that a role out of the service could occur across china . kateri jochum -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform after drastic cost-cutting steps imposed earlier this year , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- aim to expand the revenue basis for the national health service .

a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "

picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .

" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .

although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .
a few blocks down the road , the komische oper has built up a reputation for music theater and stages all its performances in german .
and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .
they know how much money is at their collective disposal over the next five years - € 113.6 million -lrb- $ 149.5 million -rrb- for 2004 , to be gradually reduced to € 96.8 million in 2009 - and can plan and perform accordingly .
strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .
after an embarrassing debacle which involved berlin 's minister of culture , thomas flierl , commissioning a sneaky piece of reporting into fülle 's background , the latter withdrew his candidature .
that just leaves schindhelm , who is currently facing allegations of a past as an informer for the east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- .
before his application can move onto the next phase , his stasi files are to be scrutinized by a specially appointed committee .
if they find nothing worthy of great outcry , he will be invited to present himself and his viability to the opera foundation committee .
it 's a bureaucratic merry-go-round , but if he can hold on through all the stopping and starting without falling off , maybe he is just the man for the job . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brawling in bayreuth just days before the premiere of the feverishly awaited new staging of richard wagner 's opera " parsifal " at this year 's bayreuth festival , the leading tenor hit out at the production and its controversial director .

arbitration discussions between the parties have failed and the church leaders have made it clear that negotiations are over . the row revolves around an increase of tarmac by 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse in france and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension is of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant is threatened with huge losses . loss of airbus work threatens plant the new flagship airplanes arriving for prep work for delivery would have to go elsewhere , resulting in the loss of around 100 jobs and could lead to hamburg losing its place as a major center in the worldwide aviation construction industry .

airbus responded by upping its compensation payment by € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.95 million -rrb- . parent group considers french relocation this weekend will see crisis talks take place in a bid to resolve the dispute and save the future of the hamburg plant .
should there be no compromise , the a380 will have to find another home , with the production plant in toulouse ready to accept the extra work .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .
croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .
while the first period had few noteworthy incidents the first ten minutes of the second half were action packed . with 49 minutes gone inter 's argentine julio cruz pressed the self-destruct button fouling ludovic magnin as a corner from the right was delivered and referee gilles veissiere pointed to the spot .
french defender ismael -lrb- photo -rrb- , sent off in the opening 2-0 loss against inter in milan , stepped up to slot home the spot-kick . inter stage magic comeback the celebrations at the weserstadion were short-lived though as they were carved apart by a moment of magic from serbia and montenegro star stankovic six minutes later .
stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the chinese be persuaded to part with their hard earned yuan for private health insurance ?
picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .
providing the initial entry into the market is successful , it is hoped that a role out of the service could occur across china . kateri jochum -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform after drastic cost-cutting steps imposed earlier this year , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- aim to expand the revenue basis for the national health service .

now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "

until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .

in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .

on wednesday , iran warned it would seek to resume enrichment if the meeting did not go its way . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- is meeting to review what was supposed to be a total freeze on iran 's uranium enrichment activities . but on wednesday , iran asked the agency to exempt several dozen centrifuges from the agreement it hammered out with the european union , and which went it effect on monday . a western diplomat said it would be " outrageous " if iran were allowed to exempt some centrifuges - the machines used in enriching uranium - from the suspension . " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat said . dispute over paris accord iranian officials also complained on the eve of the meeting that the draft resolution put together by diplomats from britain , france , and germany , ran counter to the deal struck recently in paris . " the text of the draft resolution does not conform to the paris accord , " mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's national atomic energy organization , told the student news agency isna . he said that the europeans were trying to legally oblige iran to maintain an " unlimited suspension , " whereas iran had only agreed to freeze its controversial fuel cycle work for the duration of a fresh round of negotiations with the eu aimed at reaching a long-term solution to the nuclear stand-off . warning from iranian parliament the head of iran 's parliament warned that deputies would press for a resumption of enrichment if thursday 's iaea meeting did not go in iran 's favor .
haddad adel said the meeting would be " the moment of truth in judging the sincerity of the europeans . " " we will wait and see if the iaea makes a decision based on the law or if it will make a political decision under us pressure , " adel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
the us suspects iran of attempting to develop atomic weapons and has been trying for over a year to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council .
washington reluctantly gave its backing to the eu agreement with iran , but called it weak because it falls short of demanding possible un sanctions for iran . the eu has promised iran a long-term deal , including increased trade and peaceful nuclear technology , if it maintains a suspension of enrichment . enrichment takes low-grade uranium and refines it , turning it into a material that serve as fuel for nuclear reactors or as the raw explosive material for atomic bombs . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran freezes nuclear activity iran said it was freezing its controversial nuclear fuel work monday after brokering a deal with britain , france and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.11.2004 the real drama of berlin opera großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : west berlin 's answer to opera berlin 's three opera houses are no strangers to eluding closure and nursing the wounds of financial incision .
although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .

although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .
a few blocks down the road , the komische oper has built up a reputation for music theater and stages all its performances in german .
and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .
they know how much money is at their collective disposal over the next five years - € 113.6 million -lrb- $ 149.5 million -rrb- for 2004 , to be gradually reduced to € 96.8 million in 2009 - and can plan and perform accordingly .
strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .
after an embarrassing debacle which involved berlin 's minister of culture , thomas flierl , commissioning a sneaky piece of reporting into fülle 's background , the latter withdrew his candidature .
that just leaves schindhelm , who is currently facing allegations of a past as an informer for the east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- .
before his application can move onto the next phase , his stasi files are to be scrutinized by a specially appointed committee .
if they find nothing worthy of great outcry , he will be invited to present himself and his viability to the opera foundation committee .
it 's a bureaucratic merry-go-round , but if he can hold on through all the stopping and starting without falling off , maybe he is just the man for the job . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brawling in bayreuth just days before the premiere of the feverishly awaited new staging of richard wagner 's opera " parsifal " at this year 's bayreuth festival , the leading tenor hit out at the production and its controversial director .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2004 airbus hamburg in crisis over church land row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan to extend the hamburg runway is facing dogged resistance the hamburg aviation plant responsible for preparing and delivering the new airbus a380 super-jumbo could lose the privilege if a local church council succeeds in blocking the extension of the plant 's runway . it is a dispute that could potentially cost the german aircraft production industry one of the biggest contracts in recent years . the airbus factory at finkenwerder near hamburg requires a longer runway to cope with the soon-to-be launched freight version of the new super-jumbo a380 . however , the proposal to lengthen the existing runway has run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refuses to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
arbitration discussions between the parties have failed and the church leaders have made it clear that negotiations are over . the row revolves around an increase of tarmac by 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse in france and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension is of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant is threatened with huge losses . loss of airbus work threatens plant the new flagship airplanes arriving for prep work for delivery would have to go elsewhere , resulting in the loss of around 100 jobs and could lead to hamburg losing its place as a major center in the worldwide aviation construction industry .
this in turn would see the loss of even more jobs from the 7,000-strong workforce which would be relocated to other airbus plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg-neuenfelde church at the center of the storm .
so far , the opposition has retained the upper hand despite a split between the church elders .
bishop maria jespen has expressed her “ exceptional annoyance ” at the refusal of the other members of the parish council to continue discussions over selling the property .
but the upper administrative court in hamburg decided in favor of the church ’ s majority decision at an initial hearing in august and stopped construction of the extended runway .
airbus responded by upping its compensation payment by € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.95 million -rrb- . parent group considers french relocation this weekend will see crisis talks take place in a bid to resolve the dispute and save the future of the hamburg plant .
should there be no compromise , the a380 will have to find another home , with the production plant in toulouse ready to accept the extra work . " if the runway extension does begin in november , we can ready and deliver the airplanes in toulouse " , rainer hertrich , head of airbus parent group eads , threatened in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
relocation to the french location would not prove problematic , heinrich added . a380 signals intent in boeing battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 super-jumbo .
the construction of the a380 is the loudest statement of intent from airbus in its battle with us rival boeing .
while boeing is still the number one in terms of turnover , airbus could edge out its competitor in the civil aviation market with the new super-jumbo .
the a380 has an order book currently standing at a confirmed 129 planes with many more interested parties waiting in the wings . the a380 takes its maiden voyage in the spring of 2005 .
whether the hamburg plant takes any further part in its development until then remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus and boeing dispute goes to wto the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus .

ajax 's 1-0 defeat to juventus in turin means bayern finish runners-up in group c behind the italians and the bundesliga leaders can now plan for the knockout phase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach felix magath .
bayern coach felix magath was delighted with the display and the fact that the final away match against ajax on december 8 has nothing at stake .
" we stuttered at the beginning but after that we dominated proceedings , " explained magath .
" the final game is irrelevant as we can not finish top of the group or slip from second . " pizarro curler opens flood gates magath called for the killer instinct in front of goal and his team delivered scoring with their first shot on target after 12 minutes .
peruvian claudio pizarro cut inside and unleashed a 20 yard shot that arrowed into the top right hand corner .
still basking in their goal bayern almost conceded a shock equaliser when salem abo siam 's attempted cross ricocheted off the top of oliver kahn 's crossbar . bosnian international hasan salihamidzic relieved the tension at the olympic stadium netting on 37 minutes although he knew very little about it .
tel aviv goalkeeper liran strauber parried a goal-bound header onto the chest of salihamidzic who was virtually on the goal-line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack , left , and torsten frings .
magath brought off bastian schweinsteiger and the injured owen hargreaves but it did not spare tel-aviv from the constant munich pressure .
with just a minute to go before the interval german international torsten frings -lrb- photo , with michael ballack -rrb- produced a rasping right-footed volley that left strauber with no chance . after the break bayern used the last of their three substitutions with playmaker sebastian deisler introduced as he continues his recovery from depression . consolation goal before makaay seals it despite the fresh legs bayern eased off and tel-aviv made them pay with their first away goal in this season 's champions league .
kahn inexplicably felled barukh dego in the penalty area after 55 minutes with the maccabi striker going gown a cul-de-sac .
dego got up to convert the resulting penalty sending kahn the wrong way . however , a comeback was never on the cards and dutch marksman roy makaay netted his fifth champions league goal with 71 minutes gone . leverkusen 's progress halted in madrid real madrid and bayer leverkusen fought out an exciting 1-1 draw to leave qualification from champions league group b still up in the air for both sides on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.11.2004 airbus hamburg in crisis over church land row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan to extend the hamburg runway is facing dogged resistance the hamburg aviation plant responsible for preparing and delivering the new airbus a380 super-jumbo could lose the privilege if a local church council succeeds in blocking the extension of the plant 's runway . it is a dispute that could potentially cost the german aircraft production industry one of the biggest contracts in recent years . the airbus factory at finkenwerder near hamburg requires a longer runway to cope with the soon-to-be launched freight version of the new super-jumbo a380 . however , the proposal to lengthen the existing runway has run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refuses to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
arbitration discussions between the parties have failed and the church leaders have made it clear that negotiations are over . the row revolves around an increase of tarmac by 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse in france and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension is of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant is threatened with huge losses . loss of airbus work threatens plant the new flagship airplanes arriving for prep work for delivery would have to go elsewhere , resulting in the loss of around 100 jobs and could lead to hamburg losing its place as a major center in the worldwide aviation construction industry .
this in turn would see the loss of even more jobs from the 7,000-strong workforce which would be relocated to other airbus plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg-neuenfelde church at the center of the storm .
so far , the opposition has retained the upper hand despite a split between the church elders .
bishop maria jespen has expressed her “ exceptional annoyance ” at the refusal of the other members of the parish council to continue discussions over selling the property .
but the upper administrative court in hamburg decided in favor of the church ’ s majority decision at an initial hearing in august and stopped construction of the extended runway .
airbus responded by upping its compensation payment by € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.95 million -rrb- . parent group considers french relocation this weekend will see crisis talks take place in a bid to resolve the dispute and save the future of the hamburg plant .
should there be no compromise , the a380 will have to find another home , with the production plant in toulouse ready to accept the extra work . " if the runway extension does begin in november , we can ready and deliver the airplanes in toulouse " , rainer hertrich , head of airbus parent group eads , threatened in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
relocation to the french location would not prove problematic , heinrich added . a380 signals intent in boeing battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 super-jumbo .
the construction of the a380 is the loudest statement of intent from airbus in its battle with us rival boeing .
while boeing is still the number one in terms of turnover , airbus could edge out its competitor in the civil aviation market with the new super-jumbo .
the a380 has an order book currently standing at a confirmed 129 planes with many more interested parties waiting in the wings . the a380 takes its maiden voyage in the spring of 2005 .
whether the hamburg plant takes any further part in its development until then remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus and boeing dispute goes to wto the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .
croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .
while the first period had few noteworthy incidents the first ten minutes of the second half were action packed . with 49 minutes gone inter 's argentine julio cruz pressed the self-destruct button fouling ludovic magnin as a corner from the right was delivered and referee gilles veissiere pointed to the spot .
french defender ismael -lrb- photo -rrb- , sent off in the opening 2-0 loss against inter in milan , stepped up to slot home the spot-kick . inter stage magic comeback the celebrations at the weserstadion were short-lived though as they were carved apart by a moment of magic from serbia and montenegro star stankovic six minutes later .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension was seen as one of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant would have been threatened with huge losses . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus hamburg in crisis over church land row the hamburg aviation plant responsible for preparing and delivering the new airbus a380 super-jumbo could lose the privilege if a local church council succeeds in blocking the extension of the plant 's runway .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the chinese be persuaded to part with their hard earned yuan for private health insurance ?
picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .
providing the initial entry into the market is successful , it is hoped that a role out of the service could occur across china . kateri jochum -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform after drastic cost-cutting steps imposed earlier this year , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- aim to expand the revenue basis for the national health service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.11.2004 the real drama of berlin opera großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : west berlin 's answer to opera berlin 's three opera houses are no strangers to eluding closure and nursing the wounds of financial incision .
although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .
a few blocks down the road , the komische oper has built up a reputation for music theater and stages all its performances in german .
and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .
they know how much money is at their collective disposal over the next five years - € 113.6 million -lrb- $ 149.5 million -rrb- for 2004 , to be gradually reduced to € 96.8 million in 2009 - and can plan and perform accordingly .
strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .
after an embarrassing debacle which involved berlin 's minister of culture , thomas flierl , commissioning a sneaky piece of reporting into fülle 's background , the latter withdrew his candidature .
that just leaves schindhelm , who is currently facing allegations of a past as an informer for the east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- .
before his application can move onto the next phase , his stasi files are to be scrutinized by a specially appointed committee .
if they find nothing worthy of great outcry , he will be invited to present himself and his viability to the opera foundation committee .
it 's a bureaucratic merry-go-round , but if he can hold on through all the stopping and starting without falling off , maybe he is just the man for the job . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brawling in bayreuth just days before the premiere of the feverishly awaited new staging of richard wagner 's opera " parsifal " at this year 's bayreuth festival , the leading tenor hit out at the production and its controversial director .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .
croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .
while the first period had few noteworthy incidents the first ten minutes of the second half were action packed . with 49 minutes gone inter 's argentine julio cruz pressed the self-destruct button fouling ludovic magnin as a corner from the right was delivered and referee gilles veissiere pointed to the spot .
french defender ismael -lrb- photo -rrb- , sent off in the opening 2-0 loss against inter in milan , stepped up to slot home the spot-kick . inter stage magic comeback the celebrations at the weserstadion were short-lived though as they were carved apart by a moment of magic from serbia and montenegro star stankovic six minutes later .
stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

the eu has around 500 directives that relate to environmental and climate protection .
these regulations have often proved successful , but have also led to a number of difficulties in member states . germany is often cited as a model for the environmental sector .
ninety-two percent of germans regard the environment as being an important topic , according to a study by germany 's top state-run environmental agencies .
german enthusiasm for environmental protection , which had fallen in the 1990s , appears to be on the rise again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both new and renovated homes will have to contain proper insulation , as an energy saving measure .
this increased environmental conscience has been reinforced by a number of new laws .
anyone deciding to build a new house or to redevelop an existing one , for example , is now bound by the energy saving directive that insists on sufficient thermal insulation being used .
this , naturally , reduces the amount of thermal energy that is lost , reducing energy usage , and saving the householder on energy bills .
fixed price for green electricity germany has also introduced an energy usage law , which was drawn up to increase the amount of solar , wind , water and biogas energy pumped into the electricity market .
consumers that use an eco-electricity company not only benefit from state subsidies but also a fixed price for every kilowatt hour they consume from the national grid .
germans are also world leaders when it comes to sorting rubbish .
they want an end to the use of atomic energy , are full subscribers to the kyoto protocol and are the first nation in europe to have elected a green party as partners in a coalition government .
environmental policies are high on the national agenda .
less enthusiasm elsewhere that 's not so much the case in britain , even though the country , at least as far as following eu directives goes , ranks high in environmental protection . the disposal of rubbish like refrigerators , for instance , has led to many problems in the island nation . the british parliament failed to pass legislation to ensure that the harmful gases emitted from refrigerators are dealt with adequately .
as a result , the whole country is full of old refrigerators awaiting proper disposal .
illegal discharges each year britain emits around five million tons of toxic waste , which were dumped next to household rubbish until recently .
since last summer , this practice has been stopped , according to eu legislation .
the number of dump sites that now accept toxic material is in decline , which leads to a fear that the practice of illegally dumping such substances could now be on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain may be struggling to provide adequate disposal facilities for poisionous waste .
but elliot morley , cabinet minister for the environment , is convinced that after some initial problems , there are now ample storage and disposal facilities for toxic material .
" we have enough dumps , " he said .
" it will mean an unavoidable reduction in the space available at the dump sites , which is to be expected in the early stages -lrb- of the new directive 's -rrb- introduction .
yes , we will begin to increase the number of landfill sites available , and when the needs for the disposal of toxic waste increases , the industry will surely react . "
the government hopes that the new directives that industry is currently bringing on stream , will lead to less poisonous waste being generated .
but it does depend on the necessary legislation and the industry 's readiness to organize itself on how best to deal with the disposal of harmful substances .
discussions on how the decontamination of poisonous substances can be brought under control with the help of tax measures have been going on for years .
a corresponding bill is yet to be introduced , in the meantime , a new business is flourishing , where truck drivers pick up poisonous substances , and then dump them illegally out on the streets .
romania remains a problem child eu accession candidate romania is working on its environmental policy .
measures included in the progress report from the european union show that they are content that adjustments required in eu policy have been reached .
but the new environmental laws have not yet been implemented .
corruption in the country is the biggest issue .
the greens in hungary seem to have been given some encouragement .
on the points of environmental policy , rubbish sorting and recycling , and water usage , there exist local directives , but there can often be a shortage of implementation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new nuclear power plant in normandy is more efficient , safer and more environmentally friendly than current models .
the french are struggling with a completely different problem : since the recent sharp rise in oil prices the country is becoming more and more reliant on nuclear energy .
independence from crude oil is an argument for those who are fans of nuclear power .
permit-trading of dangerous substances the environmental policy in europe should help to reduce the emission of harmful substances .
the beginning of 2005 will see the start of an emission trading system between the eu 's 25 member states .
the first multinational emission trading system in the world is the cornerstone of the eu 's objective to fulfil the targets of the kyoto protocol .
between 2008 and 2012 , an 8 percent reduction in levels of carbon dioxide emissions is to be achieved , compared to 1990 levels . petra kohnen -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin signs up russia for kyoto pact russian president vladimir putin put his signature to the un 's kyoto climate change treaty on friday , just over a week after his country 's parliament voted to ratify the document , the kremlin said .

although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .

and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .

strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .

it was so humiliating , " he said . lars k. also confirmed reports that the officers involved in the unauthorized training exercised used electrical shocks on the recruits . " they held a cable to the neck of one of the soldiers and gave him electrical shocks .
they pushed him down and he cried out . " finally , one of the soldiers involved called out the code word " tiffy , " ending the ordeal .

although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .
a few blocks down the road , the komische oper has built up a reputation for music theater and stages all its performances in german .
and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .
they know how much money is at their collective disposal over the next five years - € 113.6 million -lrb- $ 149.5 million -rrb- for 2004 , to be gradually reduced to € 96.8 million in 2009 - and can plan and perform accordingly .
strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .
after an embarrassing debacle which involved berlin 's minister of culture , thomas flierl , commissioning a sneaky piece of reporting into fülle 's background , the latter withdrew his candidature .
that just leaves schindhelm , who is currently facing allegations of a past as an informer for the east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- .
before his application can move onto the next phase , his stasi files are to be scrutinized by a specially appointed committee .
if they find nothing worthy of great outcry , he will be invited to present himself and his viability to the opera foundation committee .

on wednesday , iran warned it would seek to resume enrichment if the meeting did not go its way . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- is meeting to review what was supposed to be a total freeze on iran 's uranium enrichment activities . but on wednesday , iran asked the agency to exempt several dozen centrifuges from the agreement it hammered out with the european union , and which went it effect on monday . a western diplomat said it would be " outrageous " if iran were allowed to exempt some centrifuges - the machines used in enriching uranium - from the suspension . " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat said . dispute over paris accord iranian officials also complained on the eve of the meeting that the draft resolution put together by diplomats from britain , france , and germany , ran counter to the deal struck recently in paris . " the text of the draft resolution does not conform to the paris accord , " mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's national atomic energy organization , told the student news agency isna . he said that the europeans were trying to legally oblige iran to maintain an " unlimited suspension , " whereas iran had only agreed to freeze its controversial fuel cycle work for the duration of a fresh round of negotiations with the eu aimed at reaching a long-term solution to the nuclear stand-off . warning from iranian parliament the head of iran 's parliament warned that deputies would press for a resumption of enrichment if thursday 's iaea meeting did not go in iran 's favor .
haddad adel said the meeting would be " the moment of truth in judging the sincerity of the europeans . " " we will wait and see if the iaea makes a decision based on the law or if it will make a political decision under us pressure , " adel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran .
the us suspects iran of attempting to develop atomic weapons and has been trying for over a year to get the iaea board to take iran before the security council .
washington reluctantly gave its backing to the eu agreement with iran , but called it weak because it falls short of demanding possible un sanctions for iran . the eu has promised iran a long-term deal , including increased trade and peaceful nuclear technology , if it maintains a suspension of enrichment . enrichment takes low-grade uranium and refines it , turning it into a material that serve as fuel for nuclear reactors or as the raw explosive material for atomic bombs . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran freezes nuclear activity iran said it was freezing its controversial nuclear fuel work monday after brokering a deal with britain , france and germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both new and renovated homes will have to contain proper insulation , as an energy saving measure .
this increased environmental conscience has been reinforced by a number of new laws .
anyone deciding to build a new house or to redevelop an existing one , for example , is now bound by the energy saving directive that insists on sufficient thermal insulation being used .
this , naturally , reduces the amount of thermal energy that is lost , reducing energy usage , and saving the householder on energy bills .

the government hopes that the new directives that industry is currently bringing on stream , will lead to less poisonous waste being generated .

the eu has around 500 directives that relate to environmental and climate protection .
these regulations have often proved successful , but have also led to a number of difficulties in member states . germany is often cited as a model for the environmental sector .
ninety-two percent of germans regard the environment as being an important topic , according to a study by germany 's top state-run environmental agencies .
german enthusiasm for environmental protection , which had fallen in the 1990s , appears to be on the rise again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both new and renovated homes will have to contain proper insulation , as an energy saving measure .
this increased environmental conscience has been reinforced by a number of new laws .
anyone deciding to build a new house or to redevelop an existing one , for example , is now bound by the energy saving directive that insists on sufficient thermal insulation being used .
this , naturally , reduces the amount of thermal energy that is lost , reducing energy usage , and saving the householder on energy bills .
fixed price for green electricity germany has also introduced an energy usage law , which was drawn up to increase the amount of solar , wind , water and biogas energy pumped into the electricity market .
consumers that use an eco-electricity company not only benefit from state subsidies but also a fixed price for every kilowatt hour they consume from the national grid .
germans are also world leaders when it comes to sorting rubbish .
they want an end to the use of atomic energy , are full subscribers to the kyoto protocol and are the first nation in europe to have elected a green party as partners in a coalition government .
environmental policies are high on the national agenda .
less enthusiasm elsewhere that 's not so much the case in britain , even though the country , at least as far as following eu directives goes , ranks high in environmental protection . the disposal of rubbish like refrigerators , for instance , has led to many problems in the island nation . the british parliament failed to pass legislation to ensure that the harmful gases emitted from refrigerators are dealt with adequately .
as a result , the whole country is full of old refrigerators awaiting proper disposal .
illegal discharges each year britain emits around five million tons of toxic waste , which were dumped next to household rubbish until recently .
since last summer , this practice has been stopped , according to eu legislation .
the number of dump sites that now accept toxic material is in decline , which leads to a fear that the practice of illegally dumping such substances could now be on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain may be struggling to provide adequate disposal facilities for poisionous waste .
but elliot morley , cabinet minister for the environment , is convinced that after some initial problems , there are now ample storage and disposal facilities for toxic material .
" we have enough dumps , " he said .
" it will mean an unavoidable reduction in the space available at the dump sites , which is to be expected in the early stages -lrb- of the new directive 's -rrb- introduction .
yes , we will begin to increase the number of landfill sites available , and when the needs for the disposal of toxic waste increases , the industry will surely react . "
the government hopes that the new directives that industry is currently bringing on stream , will lead to less poisonous waste being generated .
but it does depend on the necessary legislation and the industry 's readiness to organize itself on how best to deal with the disposal of harmful substances .
discussions on how the decontamination of poisonous substances can be brought under control with the help of tax measures have been going on for years .
a corresponding bill is yet to be introduced , in the meantime , a new business is flourishing , where truck drivers pick up poisonous substances , and then dump them illegally out on the streets .
romania remains a problem child eu accession candidate romania is working on its environmental policy .
measures included in the progress report from the european union show that they are content that adjustments required in eu policy have been reached .
but the new environmental laws have not yet been implemented .
corruption in the country is the biggest issue .
the greens in hungary seem to have been given some encouragement .
on the points of environmental policy , rubbish sorting and recycling , and water usage , there exist local directives , but there can often be a shortage of implementation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new nuclear power plant in normandy is more efficient , safer and more environmentally friendly than current models .
the french are struggling with a completely different problem : since the recent sharp rise in oil prices the country is becoming more and more reliant on nuclear energy .
independence from crude oil is an argument for those who are fans of nuclear power .
permit-trading of dangerous substances the environmental policy in europe should help to reduce the emission of harmful substances .
the beginning of 2005 will see the start of an emission trading system between the eu 's 25 member states .
the first multinational emission trading system in the world is the cornerstone of the eu 's objective to fulfil the targets of the kyoto protocol .
between 2008 and 2012 , an 8 percent reduction in levels of carbon dioxide emissions is to be achieved , compared to 1990 levels . petra kohnen -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin signs up russia for kyoto pact russian president vladimir putin put his signature to the un 's kyoto climate change treaty on friday , just over a week after his country 's parliament voted to ratify the document , the kremlin said .

arbitration discussions between the parties have failed and the church leaders have made it clear that negotiations are over . the row revolves around an increase of tarmac by 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse in france and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension is of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant is threatened with huge losses . loss of airbus work threatens plant the new flagship airplanes arriving for prep work for delivery would have to go elsewhere , resulting in the loss of around 100 jobs and could lead to hamburg losing its place as a major center in the worldwide aviation construction industry .
this in turn would see the loss of even more jobs from the 7,000-strong workforce which would be relocated to other airbus plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg-neuenfelde church at the center of the storm .
so far , the opposition has retained the upper hand despite a split between the church elders .
bishop maria jespen has expressed her “ exceptional annoyance ” at the refusal of the other members of the parish council to continue discussions over selling the property .
but the upper administrative court in hamburg decided in favor of the church ’ s majority decision at an initial hearing in august and stopped construction of the extended runway .
airbus responded by upping its compensation payment by € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.95 million -rrb- . parent group considers french relocation this weekend will see crisis talks take place in a bid to resolve the dispute and save the future of the hamburg plant .
should there be no compromise , the a380 will have to find another home , with the production plant in toulouse ready to accept the extra work . " if the runway extension does begin in november , we can ready and deliver the airplanes in toulouse " , rainer hertrich , head of airbus parent group eads , threatened in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
relocation to the french location would not prove problematic , heinrich added . a380 signals intent in boeing battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 super-jumbo .
the construction of the a380 is the loudest statement of intent from airbus in its battle with us rival boeing .
while boeing is still the number one in terms of turnover , airbus could edge out its competitor in the civil aviation market with the new super-jumbo .
the a380 has an order book currently standing at a confirmed 129 planes with many more interested parties waiting in the wings . the a380 takes its maiden voyage in the spring of 2005 .
whether the hamburg plant takes any further part in its development until then remains to be seen . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus and boeing dispute goes to wto the us government has filed a complaint at the wto against what it calls unfair eu subsidies paid to airline manufacturer airbus .

arbitration discussions between the parties have failed and the church leaders have made it clear that negotiations are over . the row revolves around an increase of tarmac by 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the chinese be persuaded to part with their hard earned yuan for private health insurance ?
picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .
providing the initial entry into the market is successful , it is hoped that a role out of the service could occur across china . kateri jochum -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform after drastic cost-cutting steps imposed earlier this year , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- aim to expand the revenue basis for the national health service .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the chinese be persuaded to part with their hard earned yuan for private health insurance ?
picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .
providing the initial entry into the market is successful , it is hoped that a role out of the service could occur across china . kateri jochum -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform after drastic cost-cutting steps imposed earlier this year , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- aim to expand the revenue basis for the national health service .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension was seen as one of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant would have been threatened with huge losses . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus hamburg in crisis over church land row the hamburg aviation plant responsible for preparing and delivering the new airbus a380 super-jumbo could lose the privilege if a local church council succeeds in blocking the extension of the plant 's runway .

koblenz 's handful of sites nearly fill the day but still leave time for a nap before dinner for the jet-lagged traveler . the first day of a long-awaited vacation is all too often nothing but a murky collage of impressions .
but a trip to -lrb- and a nap in -rrb- koblenz , the only german city on both the moselle and rhine rivers , offers a good alternative to stumbling half-asleep though a big city . just over an hour train ride from frankfurt international airport , the city 's landmarks and the region 's tasty wines make it an ideal starting point to shift into tourist gear . upon arrival , choose between a quick ride on bus line 1 , which leaves from the train station , or a 20-minute walk through the city 's main shopping avenues and past numerous cafes offering a jolt of caffeine before you arrive at koblenz 's tourist highlight . rivers meet at german corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koblenz 's most famous landmark , and much of the town , was flooded in january 2003 without a doubt , the city 's most famous monument is deutsches eck -lrb- german corner -rrb- .
the spot where the moselle flows into the rhine owes its name to the teutonic order of knights who founded a settlement here in 1216 . though the bronze replica of kaiser wilhelm i - the original from 1897 was destroyed during the world war ii - seems to fit in perfectly with the 16 flags on the triangular piece of land that juts into the two rivers , the pedestal actually stood empty from 1953 to 1990 as a reminder of divided germany .
it was n't until 1993 that a the copy was put in place . a new city with 2,000 years history across the rhine and a short chair-lift ride 118 meters -lrb- 387 feet -rrb- up the river 's steep banks , the ehrenbreitstein fortress keeps watch from the top of the cliffs .
originally built around the year 1000 , romans , franks , the french and prussians all guarded the fortifications that are now home to a state museum and youth hostel . the view from ehrenbreitstein reveals koblenz as a new , rebuilt city .
though the city of 100,000 was originally founded in the ninth century , bombing during world war ii reduced the historic center to rubble .
the only building left standing was the pink deutscher kaiser inn , which is still open to the public . plenty to see on the rhine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks safe now , but the rhine 's lorelei was the downfall of many sailors one of the main reasons to visit koblenz is tied to the rhine 's river banks .
that 's where the city 's ships line up to offer visitors floating tours lasting from one hour to one day . while the observant traveler may already have seen the vineyards and castles that dot the river 's banks on the train ride from frankfurt , the landscape makes for interesting pictures hard to find anywhere else in germany and the boat 's gentle rocking make it good place for a quick nap .
do n't worry , though , the clicking of cameras will wake you up when you get to the famous lorelei . according to sailors ' legend , it was at this curve in the river that a beautiful woman would lounge alongside the river , combing her long blonde hair , driving the ships ' men to distraction and leading them to crash on the rocks below .
these days , however , sunburn poses more of a danger than the wide river 's rocky bottom . rejuvenated and back in town after the cruise , the city 's many churches and pedestrian squares are ideal for meandering and the half-timbered houses of the weindorf -lrb- wine village -rrb- offer an ambiance suited to sampling the region 's renowned rhine and moselle wines as well as some local gastronomic specialties before nodding off for the day . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the city of koblenz information in english about koblenz and a virtual guided tour of what the city has to offer .

but a trip to -lrb- and a nap in -rrb- koblenz , the only german city on both the moselle and rhine rivers , offers a good alternative to stumbling half-asleep though a big city . just over an hour train ride from frankfurt international airport , the city 's landmarks and the region 's tasty wines make it an ideal starting point to shift into tourist gear . upon arrival , choose between a quick ride on bus line 1 , which leaves from the train station , or a 20-minute walk through the city 's main shopping avenues and past numerous cafes offering a jolt of caffeine before you arrive at koblenz 's tourist highlight . rivers meet at german corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koblenz 's most famous landmark , and much of the town , was flooded in january 2003 without a doubt , the city 's most famous monument is deutsches eck -lrb- german corner -rrb- .
the spot where the moselle flows into the rhine owes its name to the teutonic order of knights who founded a settlement here in 1216 . though the bronze replica of kaiser wilhelm i - the original from 1897 was destroyed during the world war ii - seems to fit in perfectly with the 16 flags on the triangular piece of land that juts into the two rivers , the pedestal actually stood empty from 1953 to 1990 as a reminder of divided germany .

originally built around the year 1000 , romans , franks , the french and prussians all guarded the fortifications that are now home to a state museum and youth hostel . the view from ehrenbreitstein reveals koblenz as a new , rebuilt city .
though the city of 100,000 was originally founded in the ninth century , bombing during world war ii reduced the historic center to rubble .
the only building left standing was the pink deutscher kaiser inn , which is still open to the public . plenty to see on the rhine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks safe now , but the rhine 's lorelei was the downfall of many sailors one of the main reasons to visit koblenz is tied to the rhine 's river banks .

anyone visiting the city today will literally stumble over traces of ancient history at nearly every corner . trier is the oldest city in germany .
roman emperor augustus established " augusta treverorum " in the year 16 bc .
these days , the citiy 's 2,000-year-old history attracts masses of tourists . until the fifth century , trier was the capital of the west-roman empire .
as a result , the remaining buildings are monumental : the amphitheater , which accommodated 30,000 people , the extensive thermal springs , the north gate of the roman city wall - today 's porta nigra - and the enormous hall of the basilica , which became a royal residence after the conquest by the franconians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trier was not damaged during world war two the ancient trier was a large , pulsating city and a center of trade with road and river connections to all regions of europe . from metropolis to province after the departure of the romans , the city became one of the most important ecclesiastical and secular centers .
the archbishops of trier were also princes : they elected the emperor and played an important role in political decisions during imperial assemblies . traces of their power and influence can be found in the elaborate places of worship and the city 's renaissance , baroque and rococo palaces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main market place forms trier 's city center after the french revolutionary wars , trier became the district city of the rhine province , far away from the prussian center of government in berlin . the 19th century industrial boom , which ensured an upswing almost everywhere , failed to arrive in trier - the necessary conditions were missing . its lack of industrial infrastructure proved to be an advantage for trier in the 20th century as it did not become a target for allied destruction during the two world wars .
the historical buildings that remain draw thousands of tourists each years . trier 's famous son bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx was born in trier in 1818 many visitors also stop by the karl marx house on brückenstrasse .
marx , the founder of scientific socialism was born here in 1818 . after his high school graduation , marx left trier to explore the world .

explore cologne and beyond düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past a picturesque pedal down the rhine essen : a changing industrial landscape cities -pipe- 25.11.2004 koblenz : good for getting over jet lag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koblenz 's deutsches eck is a highlight on any rhine boat tour recovering from a long-haul flight can take some time .
koblenz 's handful of sites nearly fill the day but still leave time for a nap before dinner for the jet-lagged traveler . the first day of a long-awaited vacation is all too often nothing but a murky collage of impressions .
but a trip to -lrb- and a nap in -rrb- koblenz , the only german city on both the moselle and rhine rivers , offers a good alternative to stumbling half-asleep though a big city . just over an hour train ride from frankfurt international airport , the city 's landmarks and the region 's tasty wines make it an ideal starting point to shift into tourist gear . upon arrival , choose between a quick ride on bus line 1 , which leaves from the train station , or a 20-minute walk through the city 's main shopping avenues and past numerous cafes offering a jolt of caffeine before you arrive at koblenz 's tourist highlight . rivers meet at german corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koblenz 's most famous landmark , and much of the town , was flooded in january 2003 without a doubt , the city 's most famous monument is deutsches eck -lrb- german corner -rrb- .
the spot where the moselle flows into the rhine owes its name to the teutonic order of knights who founded a settlement here in 1216 . though the bronze replica of kaiser wilhelm i - the original from 1897 was destroyed during the world war ii - seems to fit in perfectly with the 16 flags on the triangular piece of land that juts into the two rivers , the pedestal actually stood empty from 1953 to 1990 as a reminder of divided germany .
it was n't until 1993 that a the copy was put in place . a new city with 2,000 years history across the rhine and a short chair-lift ride 118 meters -lrb- 387 feet -rrb- up the river 's steep banks , the ehrenbreitstein fortress keeps watch from the top of the cliffs .
originally built around the year 1000 , romans , franks , the french and prussians all guarded the fortifications that are now home to a state museum and youth hostel . the view from ehrenbreitstein reveals koblenz as a new , rebuilt city .
though the city of 100,000 was originally founded in the ninth century , bombing during world war ii reduced the historic center to rubble .
the only building left standing was the pink deutscher kaiser inn , which is still open to the public . plenty to see on the rhine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks safe now , but the rhine 's lorelei was the downfall of many sailors one of the main reasons to visit koblenz is tied to the rhine 's river banks .
that 's where the city 's ships line up to offer visitors floating tours lasting from one hour to one day . while the observant traveler may already have seen the vineyards and castles that dot the river 's banks on the train ride from frankfurt , the landscape makes for interesting pictures hard to find anywhere else in germany and the boat 's gentle rocking make it good place for a quick nap .
do n't worry , though , the clicking of cameras will wake you up when you get to the famous lorelei . according to sailors ' legend , it was at this curve in the river that a beautiful woman would lounge alongside the river , combing her long blonde hair , driving the ships ' men to distraction and leading them to crash on the rocks below .
these days , however , sunburn poses more of a danger than the wide river 's rocky bottom . rejuvenated and back in town after the cruise , the city 's many churches and pedestrian squares are ideal for meandering and the half-timbered houses of the weindorf -lrb- wine village -rrb- offer an ambiance suited to sampling the region 's renowned rhine and moselle wines as well as some local gastronomic specialties before nodding off for the day . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the city of koblenz information in english about koblenz and a virtual guided tour of what the city has to offer .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .
croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .
while the first period had few noteworthy incidents the first ten minutes of the second half were action packed . with 49 minutes gone inter 's argentine julio cruz pressed the self-destruct button fouling ludovic magnin as a corner from the right was delivered and referee gilles veissiere pointed to the spot .
french defender ismael -lrb- photo -rrb- , sent off in the opening 2-0 loss against inter in milan , stepped up to slot home the spot-kick . inter stage magic comeback the celebrations at the weserstadion were short-lived though as they were carved apart by a moment of magic from serbia and montenegro star stankovic six minutes later .
stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .
croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .
while the first period had few noteworthy incidents the first ten minutes of the second half were action packed . with 49 minutes gone inter 's argentine julio cruz pressed the self-destruct button fouling ludovic magnin as a corner from the right was delivered and referee gilles veissiere pointed to the spot .
french defender ismael -lrb- photo -rrb- , sent off in the opening 2-0 loss against inter in milan , stepped up to slot home the spot-kick . inter stage magic comeback the celebrations at the weserstadion were short-lived though as they were carved apart by a moment of magic from serbia and montenegro star stankovic six minutes later .
stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.11.2004 the real drama of berlin opera großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : west berlin 's answer to opera berlin 's three opera houses are no strangers to eluding closure and nursing the wounds of financial incision .
although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .
a few blocks down the road , the komische oper has built up a reputation for music theater and stages all its performances in german .
and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .
they know how much money is at their collective disposal over the next five years - € 113.6 million -lrb- $ 149.5 million -rrb- for 2004 , to be gradually reduced to € 96.8 million in 2009 - and can plan and perform accordingly .
strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .
after an embarrassing debacle which involved berlin 's minister of culture , thomas flierl , commissioning a sneaky piece of reporting into fülle 's background , the latter withdrew his candidature .
that just leaves schindhelm , who is currently facing allegations of a past as an informer for the east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- .
before his application can move onto the next phase , his stasi files are to be scrutinized by a specially appointed committee .
if they find nothing worthy of great outcry , he will be invited to present himself and his viability to the opera foundation committee .
it 's a bureaucratic merry-go-round , but if he can hold on through all the stopping and starting without falling off , maybe he is just the man for the job . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brawling in bayreuth just days before the premiere of the feverishly awaited new staging of richard wagner 's opera " parsifal " at this year 's bayreuth festival , the leading tenor hit out at the production and its controversial director .

ajax 's 1-0 defeat to juventus in turin means bayern finish runners-up in group c behind the italians and the bundesliga leaders can now plan for the knockout phase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach felix magath .
bayern coach felix magath was delighted with the display and the fact that the final away match against ajax on december 8 has nothing at stake .
" we stuttered at the beginning but after that we dominated proceedings , " explained magath .
" the final game is irrelevant as we can not finish top of the group or slip from second . " pizarro curler opens flood gates magath called for the killer instinct in front of goal and his team delivered scoring with their first shot on target after 12 minutes .
peruvian claudio pizarro cut inside and unleashed a 20 yard shot that arrowed into the top right hand corner .
still basking in their goal bayern almost conceded a shock equaliser when salem abo siam 's attempted cross ricocheted off the top of oliver kahn 's crossbar . bosnian international hasan salihamidzic relieved the tension at the olympic stadium netting on 37 minutes although he knew very little about it .
tel aviv goalkeeper liran strauber parried a goal-bound header onto the chest of salihamidzic who was virtually on the goal-line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack , left , and torsten frings .
magath brought off bastian schweinsteiger and the injured owen hargreaves but it did not spare tel-aviv from the constant munich pressure .
with just a minute to go before the interval german international torsten frings -lrb- photo , with michael ballack -rrb- produced a rasping right-footed volley that left strauber with no chance . after the break bayern used the last of their three substitutions with playmaker sebastian deisler introduced as he continues his recovery from depression . consolation goal before makaay seals it despite the fresh legs bayern eased off and tel-aviv made them pay with their first away goal in this season 's champions league .
kahn inexplicably felled barukh dego in the penalty area after 55 minutes with the maccabi striker going gown a cul-de-sac .
dego got up to convert the resulting penalty sending kahn the wrong way . however , a comeback was never on the cards and dutch marksman roy makaay netted his fifth champions league goal with 71 minutes gone . leverkusen 's progress halted in madrid real madrid and bayer leverkusen fought out an exciting 1-1 draw to leave qualification from champions league group b still up in the air for both sides on tuesday .
" of course i wanted to go back to germany with a win because then we could have relaxed for the last game but a draw is still good , " said bayer coach klaus augenthaler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's dimitar berbatov celebrates with carsten ramelow .
bayer 's bulgarian international dimitar berbatov tormented real just as he had done in their first encounter in germany two months ago and put the visitors ahead after 36 minutes .

although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .
a few blocks down the road , the komische oper has built up a reputation for music theater and stages all its performances in german .
and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .
they know how much money is at their collective disposal over the next five years - € 113.6 million -lrb- $ 149.5 million -rrb- for 2004 , to be gradually reduced to € 96.8 million in 2009 - and can plan and perform accordingly .
strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .
after an embarrassing debacle which involved berlin 's minister of culture , thomas flierl , commissioning a sneaky piece of reporting into fülle 's background , the latter withdrew his candidature .
that just leaves schindhelm , who is currently facing allegations of a past as an informer for the east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- .
before his application can move onto the next phase , his stasi files are to be scrutinized by a specially appointed committee .
if they find nothing worthy of great outcry , he will be invited to present himself and his viability to the opera foundation committee .
it 's a bureaucratic merry-go-round , but if he can hold on through all the stopping and starting without falling off , maybe he is just the man for the job . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brawling in bayreuth just days before the premiere of the feverishly awaited new staging of richard wagner 's opera " parsifal " at this year 's bayreuth festival , the leading tenor hit out at the production and its controversial director .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .

stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the chinese be persuaded to part with their hard earned yuan for private health insurance ?
picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .
providing the initial entry into the market is successful , it is hoped that a role out of the service could occur across china . kateri jochum -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform after drastic cost-cutting steps imposed earlier this year , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- aim to expand the revenue basis for the national health service .

arbitration discussions between the parties have failed and the church leaders have made it clear that negotiations are over . the row revolves around an increase of tarmac by 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .

without it , the airbus plant is threatened with huge losses . loss of airbus work threatens plant the new flagship airplanes arriving for prep work for delivery would have to go elsewhere , resulting in the loss of around 100 jobs and could lead to hamburg losing its place as a major center in the worldwide aviation construction industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.11.2004 europe 's environmental engagement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will solar power stations help to meet europe 's energy needs ?
the eu has around 500 directives that relate to environmental and climate protection .
these regulations have often proved successful , but have also led to a number of difficulties in member states . germany is often cited as a model for the environmental sector .
ninety-two percent of germans regard the environment as being an important topic , according to a study by germany 's top state-run environmental agencies .
german enthusiasm for environmental protection , which had fallen in the 1990s , appears to be on the rise again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both new and renovated homes will have to contain proper insulation , as an energy saving measure .
this increased environmental conscience has been reinforced by a number of new laws .
anyone deciding to build a new house or to redevelop an existing one , for example , is now bound by the energy saving directive that insists on sufficient thermal insulation being used .
this , naturally , reduces the amount of thermal energy that is lost , reducing energy usage , and saving the householder on energy bills .
fixed price for green electricity germany has also introduced an energy usage law , which was drawn up to increase the amount of solar , wind , water and biogas energy pumped into the electricity market .
consumers that use an eco-electricity company not only benefit from state subsidies but also a fixed price for every kilowatt hour they consume from the national grid .
germans are also world leaders when it comes to sorting rubbish .
they want an end to the use of atomic energy , are full subscribers to the kyoto protocol and are the first nation in europe to have elected a green party as partners in a coalition government .
environmental policies are high on the national agenda .
less enthusiasm elsewhere that 's not so much the case in britain , even though the country , at least as far as following eu directives goes , ranks high in environmental protection . the disposal of rubbish like refrigerators , for instance , has led to many problems in the island nation . the british parliament failed to pass legislation to ensure that the harmful gases emitted from refrigerators are dealt with adequately .
as a result , the whole country is full of old refrigerators awaiting proper disposal .
illegal discharges each year britain emits around five million tons of toxic waste , which were dumped next to household rubbish until recently .
since last summer , this practice has been stopped , according to eu legislation .
the number of dump sites that now accept toxic material is in decline , which leads to a fear that the practice of illegally dumping such substances could now be on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain may be struggling to provide adequate disposal facilities for poisionous waste .
but elliot morley , cabinet minister for the environment , is convinced that after some initial problems , there are now ample storage and disposal facilities for toxic material .
" we have enough dumps , " he said .
" it will mean an unavoidable reduction in the space available at the dump sites , which is to be expected in the early stages -lrb- of the new directive 's -rrb- introduction .
yes , we will begin to increase the number of landfill sites available , and when the needs for the disposal of toxic waste increases , the industry will surely react . "
the government hopes that the new directives that industry is currently bringing on stream , will lead to less poisonous waste being generated .
but it does depend on the necessary legislation and the industry 's readiness to organize itself on how best to deal with the disposal of harmful substances .
discussions on how the decontamination of poisonous substances can be brought under control with the help of tax measures have been going on for years .
a corresponding bill is yet to be introduced , in the meantime , a new business is flourishing , where truck drivers pick up poisonous substances , and then dump them illegally out on the streets .
romania remains a problem child eu accession candidate romania is working on its environmental policy .
measures included in the progress report from the european union show that they are content that adjustments required in eu policy have been reached .
but the new environmental laws have not yet been implemented .
corruption in the country is the biggest issue .
the greens in hungary seem to have been given some encouragement .
on the points of environmental policy , rubbish sorting and recycling , and water usage , there exist local directives , but there can often be a shortage of implementation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new nuclear power plant in normandy is more efficient , safer and more environmentally friendly than current models .
the french are struggling with a completely different problem : since the recent sharp rise in oil prices the country is becoming more and more reliant on nuclear energy .
independence from crude oil is an argument for those who are fans of nuclear power .
permit-trading of dangerous substances the environmental policy in europe should help to reduce the emission of harmful substances .
the beginning of 2005 will see the start of an emission trading system between the eu 's 25 member states .
the first multinational emission trading system in the world is the cornerstone of the eu 's objective to fulfil the targets of the kyoto protocol .
between 2008 and 2012 , an 8 percent reduction in levels of carbon dioxide emissions is to be achieved , compared to 1990 levels . petra kohnen -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin signs up russia for kyoto pact russian president vladimir putin put his signature to the un 's kyoto climate change treaty on friday , just over a week after his country 's parliament voted to ratify the document , the kremlin said .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .
croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .
while the first period had few noteworthy incidents the first ten minutes of the second half were action packed . with 49 minutes gone inter 's argentine julio cruz pressed the self-destruct button fouling ludovic magnin as a corner from the right was delivered and referee gilles veissiere pointed to the spot .
french defender ismael -lrb- photo -rrb- , sent off in the opening 2-0 loss against inter in milan , stepped up to slot home the spot-kick . inter stage magic comeback the celebrations at the weserstadion were short-lived though as they were carved apart by a moment of magic from serbia and montenegro star stankovic six minutes later .
stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

arbitration discussions between the parties have failed and the church leaders have made it clear that negotiations are over . the row revolves around an increase of tarmac by 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse in france and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension is of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant is threatened with huge losses . loss of airbus work threatens plant the new flagship airplanes arriving for prep work for delivery would have to go elsewhere , resulting in the loss of around 100 jobs and could lead to hamburg losing its place as a major center in the worldwide aviation construction industry .
this in turn would see the loss of even more jobs from the 7,000-strong workforce which would be relocated to other airbus plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg-neuenfelde church at the center of the storm .
so far , the opposition has retained the upper hand despite a split between the church elders .
bishop maria jespen has expressed her “ exceptional annoyance ” at the refusal of the other members of the parish council to continue discussions over selling the property .
but the upper administrative court in hamburg decided in favor of the church ’ s majority decision at an initial hearing in august and stopped construction of the extended runway .
airbus responded by upping its compensation payment by € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.95 million -rrb- . parent group considers french relocation this weekend will see crisis talks take place in a bid to resolve the dispute and save the future of the hamburg plant .
should there be no compromise , the a380 will have to find another home , with the production plant in toulouse ready to accept the extra work . " if the runway extension does begin in november , we can ready and deliver the airplanes in toulouse " , rainer hertrich , head of airbus parent group eads , threatened in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
relocation to the french location would not prove problematic , heinrich added . a380 signals intent in boeing battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 super-jumbo .
the construction of the a380 is the loudest statement of intent from airbus in its battle with us rival boeing .
while boeing is still the number one in terms of turnover , airbus could edge out its competitor in the civil aviation market with the new super-jumbo .
the a380 has an order book currently standing at a confirmed 129 planes with many more interested parties waiting in the wings . the a380 takes its maiden voyage in the spring of 2005 .

arbitration discussions between the parties have failed and the church leaders have made it clear that negotiations are over . the row revolves around an increase of tarmac by 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse in france and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension is of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant is threatened with huge losses . loss of airbus work threatens plant the new flagship airplanes arriving for prep work for delivery would have to go elsewhere , resulting in the loss of around 100 jobs and could lead to hamburg losing its place as a major center in the worldwide aviation construction industry .

airbus responded by upping its compensation payment by € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.95 million -rrb- . parent group considers french relocation this weekend will see crisis talks take place in a bid to resolve the dispute and save the future of the hamburg plant .
should there be no compromise , the a380 will have to find another home , with the production plant in toulouse ready to accept the extra work .

bayern coach felix magath was delighted with the display and the fact that the final away match against ajax on december 8 has nothing at stake .
" we stuttered at the beginning but after that we dominated proceedings , " explained magath .
" the final game is irrelevant as we can not finish top of the group or slip from second . " pizarro curler opens flood gates magath called for the killer instinct in front of goal and his team delivered scoring with their first shot on target after 12 minutes .
peruvian claudio pizarro cut inside and unleashed a 20 yard shot that arrowed into the top right hand corner .
still basking in their goal bayern almost conceded a shock equaliser when salem abo siam 's attempted cross ricocheted off the top of oliver kahn 's crossbar . bosnian international hasan salihamidzic relieved the tension at the olympic stadium netting on 37 minutes although he knew very little about it .

kahn inexplicably felled barukh dego in the penalty area after 55 minutes with the maccabi striker going gown a cul-de-sac .
dego got up to convert the resulting penalty sending kahn the wrong way . however , a comeback was never on the cards and dutch marksman roy makaay netted his fifth champions league goal with 71 minutes gone . leverkusen 's progress halted in madrid real madrid and bayer leverkusen fought out an exciting 1-1 draw to leave qualification from champions league group b still up in the air for both sides on tuesday .
" of course i wanted to go back to germany with a win because then we could have relaxed for the last game but a draw is still good , " said bayer coach klaus augenthaler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's dimitar berbatov celebrates with carsten ramelow .

real club captain raul then gave the nine-time european champions a deserved share of the points 20 minutes before the whistle to take him to 49 champions league goals and a share of the all-time club record with former real legend alfredo di stefano . justice is done and bayer fight another day the spaniards could have secured their qualification 10 minutes from time after zinedine zidane was brought down in the area by bayer defender juan .

the eu has around 500 directives that relate to environmental and climate protection .
these regulations have often proved successful , but have also led to a number of difficulties in member states . germany is often cited as a model for the environmental sector .
ninety-two percent of germans regard the environment as being an important topic , according to a study by germany 's top state-run environmental agencies .
german enthusiasm for environmental protection , which had fallen in the 1990s , appears to be on the rise again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both new and renovated homes will have to contain proper insulation , as an energy saving measure .
this increased environmental conscience has been reinforced by a number of new laws .
anyone deciding to build a new house or to redevelop an existing one , for example , is now bound by the energy saving directive that insists on sufficient thermal insulation being used .
this , naturally , reduces the amount of thermal energy that is lost , reducing energy usage , and saving the householder on energy bills .
fixed price for green electricity germany has also introduced an energy usage law , which was drawn up to increase the amount of solar , wind , water and biogas energy pumped into the electricity market .
consumers that use an eco-electricity company not only benefit from state subsidies but also a fixed price for every kilowatt hour they consume from the national grid .
germans are also world leaders when it comes to sorting rubbish .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .
croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .
while the first period had few noteworthy incidents the first ten minutes of the second half were action packed . with 49 minutes gone inter 's argentine julio cruz pressed the self-destruct button fouling ludovic magnin as a corner from the right was delivered and referee gilles veissiere pointed to the spot .
french defender ismael -lrb- photo -rrb- , sent off in the opening 2-0 loss against inter in milan , stepped up to slot home the spot-kick . inter stage magic comeback the celebrations at the weserstadion were short-lived though as they were carved apart by a moment of magic from serbia and montenegro star stankovic six minutes later .
stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.11.2004 the real drama of berlin opera großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : west berlin 's answer to opera berlin 's three opera houses are no strangers to eluding closure and nursing the wounds of financial incision .
although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .
a few blocks down the road , the komische oper has built up a reputation for music theater and stages all its performances in german .
and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .
they know how much money is at their collective disposal over the next five years - € 113.6 million -lrb- $ 149.5 million -rrb- for 2004 , to be gradually reduced to € 96.8 million in 2009 - and can plan and perform accordingly .
strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .
after an embarrassing debacle which involved berlin 's minister of culture , thomas flierl , commissioning a sneaky piece of reporting into fülle 's background , the latter withdrew his candidature .
that just leaves schindhelm , who is currently facing allegations of a past as an informer for the east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- .
before his application can move onto the next phase , his stasi files are to be scrutinized by a specially appointed committee .
if they find nothing worthy of great outcry , he will be invited to present himself and his viability to the opera foundation committee .
it 's a bureaucratic merry-go-round , but if he can hold on through all the stopping and starting without falling off , maybe he is just the man for the job . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brawling in bayreuth just days before the premiere of the feverishly awaited new staging of richard wagner 's opera " parsifal " at this year 's bayreuth festival , the leading tenor hit out at the production and its controversial director .

environmental policies are high on the national agenda .
less enthusiasm elsewhere that 's not so much the case in britain , even though the country , at least as far as following eu directives goes , ranks high in environmental protection . the disposal of rubbish like refrigerators , for instance , has led to many problems in the island nation . the british parliament failed to pass legislation to ensure that the harmful gases emitted from refrigerators are dealt with adequately .
as a result , the whole country is full of old refrigerators awaiting proper disposal .
illegal discharges each year britain emits around five million tons of toxic waste , which were dumped next to household rubbish until recently .
since last summer , this practice has been stopped , according to eu legislation .
the number of dump sites that now accept toxic material is in decline , which leads to a fear that the practice of illegally dumping such substances could now be on the increase .

but elliot morley , cabinet minister for the environment , is convinced that after some initial problems , there are now ample storage and disposal facilities for toxic material .
" we have enough dumps , " he said .
" it will mean an unavoidable reduction in the space available at the dump sites , which is to be expected in the early stages -lrb- of the new directive 's -rrb- introduction .
yes , we will begin to increase the number of landfill sites available , and when the needs for the disposal of toxic waste increases , the industry will surely react . "
the government hopes that the new directives that industry is currently bringing on stream , will lead to less poisonous waste being generated .
but it does depend on the necessary legislation and the industry 's readiness to organize itself on how best to deal with the disposal of harmful substances .
discussions on how the decontamination of poisonous substances can be brought under control with the help of tax measures have been going on for years .
a corresponding bill is yet to be introduced , in the meantime , a new business is flourishing , where truck drivers pick up poisonous substances , and then dump them illegally out on the streets .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the chinese be persuaded to part with their hard earned yuan for private health insurance ?
picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .

on wednesday , iran warned it would seek to resume enrichment if the meeting did not go its way . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- is meeting to review what was supposed to be a total freeze on iran 's uranium enrichment activities . but on wednesday , iran asked the agency to exempt several dozen centrifuges from the agreement it hammered out with the european union , and which went it effect on monday . a western diplomat said it would be " outrageous " if iran were allowed to exempt some centrifuges - the machines used in enriching uranium - from the suspension . " it is not acceptable to us , " a european diplomat said . dispute over paris accord iranian officials also complained on the eve of the meeting that the draft resolution put together by diplomats from britain , france , and germany , ran counter to the deal struck recently in paris . " the text of the draft resolution does not conform to the paris accord , " mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's national atomic energy organization , told the student news agency isna . he said that the europeans were trying to legally oblige iran to maintain an " unlimited suspension , " whereas iran had only agreed to freeze its controversial fuel cycle work for the duration of a fresh round of negotiations with the eu aimed at reaching a long-term solution to the nuclear stand-off . warning from iranian parliament the head of iran 's parliament warned that deputies would press for a resumption of enrichment if thursday 's iaea meeting did not go in iran 's favor .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension was seen as one of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant would have been threatened with huge losses . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus hamburg in crisis over church land row the hamburg aviation plant responsible for preparing and delivering the new airbus a380 super-jumbo could lose the privilege if a local church council succeeds in blocking the extension of the plant 's runway .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.11.2004 the real drama of berlin opera großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : west berlin 's answer to opera berlin 's three opera houses are no strangers to eluding closure and nursing the wounds of financial incision .
although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .
a few blocks down the road , the komische oper has built up a reputation for music theater and stages all its performances in german .
and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .
they know how much money is at their collective disposal over the next five years - € 113.6 million -lrb- $ 149.5 million -rrb- for 2004 , to be gradually reduced to € 96.8 million in 2009 - and can plan and perform accordingly .
strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .
after an embarrassing debacle which involved berlin 's minister of culture , thomas flierl , commissioning a sneaky piece of reporting into fülle 's background , the latter withdrew his candidature .
that just leaves schindhelm , who is currently facing allegations of a past as an informer for the east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- .
before his application can move onto the next phase , his stasi files are to be scrutinized by a specially appointed committee .
if they find nothing worthy of great outcry , he will be invited to present himself and his viability to the opera foundation committee .
it 's a bureaucratic merry-go-round , but if he can hold on through all the stopping and starting without falling off , maybe he is just the man for the job . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brawling in bayreuth just days before the premiere of the feverishly awaited new staging of richard wagner 's opera " parsifal " at this year 's bayreuth festival , the leading tenor hit out at the production and its controversial director .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .
croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .
while the first period had few noteworthy incidents the first ten minutes of the second half were action packed . with 49 minutes gone inter 's argentine julio cruz pressed the self-destruct button fouling ludovic magnin as a corner from the right was delivered and referee gilles veissiere pointed to the spot .
french defender ismael -lrb- photo -rrb- , sent off in the opening 2-0 loss against inter in milan , stepped up to slot home the spot-kick . inter stage magic comeback the celebrations at the weserstadion were short-lived though as they were carved apart by a moment of magic from serbia and montenegro star stankovic six minutes later .
stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension was seen as one of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant would have been threatened with huge losses . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus hamburg in crisis over church land row the hamburg aviation plant responsible for preparing and delivering the new airbus a380 super-jumbo could lose the privilege if a local church council succeeds in blocking the extension of the plant 's runway .

german enthusiasm for environmental protection , which had fallen in the 1990s , appears to be on the rise again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both new and renovated homes will have to contain proper insulation , as an energy saving measure .
this increased environmental conscience has been reinforced by a number of new laws .
anyone deciding to build a new house or to redevelop an existing one , for example , is now bound by the energy saving directive that insists on sufficient thermal insulation being used .
this , naturally , reduces the amount of thermal energy that is lost , reducing energy usage , and saving the householder on energy bills .
fixed price for green electricity germany has also introduced an energy usage law , which was drawn up to increase the amount of solar , wind , water and biogas energy pumped into the electricity market .
consumers that use an eco-electricity company not only benefit from state subsidies but also a fixed price for every kilowatt hour they consume from the national grid .
germans are also world leaders when it comes to sorting rubbish .
they want an end to the use of atomic energy , are full subscribers to the kyoto protocol and are the first nation in europe to have elected a green party as partners in a coalition government .
environmental policies are high on the national agenda .
less enthusiasm elsewhere that 's not so much the case in britain , even though the country , at least as far as following eu directives goes , ranks high in environmental protection . the disposal of rubbish like refrigerators , for instance , has led to many problems in the island nation . the british parliament failed to pass legislation to ensure that the harmful gases emitted from refrigerators are dealt with adequately .
as a result , the whole country is full of old refrigerators awaiting proper disposal .
illegal discharges each year britain emits around five million tons of toxic waste , which were dumped next to household rubbish until recently .
since last summer , this practice has been stopped , according to eu legislation .
the number of dump sites that now accept toxic material is in decline , which leads to a fear that the practice of illegally dumping such substances could now be on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain may be struggling to provide adequate disposal facilities for poisionous waste .
but elliot morley , cabinet minister for the environment , is convinced that after some initial problems , there are now ample storage and disposal facilities for toxic material .
" we have enough dumps , " he said .
" it will mean an unavoidable reduction in the space available at the dump sites , which is to be expected in the early stages -lrb- of the new directive 's -rrb- introduction .
yes , we will begin to increase the number of landfill sites available , and when the needs for the disposal of toxic waste increases , the industry will surely react . "
the government hopes that the new directives that industry is currently bringing on stream , will lead to less poisonous waste being generated .
but it does depend on the necessary legislation and the industry 's readiness to organize itself on how best to deal with the disposal of harmful substances .
discussions on how the decontamination of poisonous substances can be brought under control with the help of tax measures have been going on for years .
a corresponding bill is yet to be introduced , in the meantime , a new business is flourishing , where truck drivers pick up poisonous substances , and then dump them illegally out on the streets .
romania remains a problem child eu accession candidate romania is working on its environmental policy .
measures included in the progress report from the european union show that they are content that adjustments required in eu policy have been reached .
but the new environmental laws have not yet been implemented .
corruption in the country is the biggest issue .
the greens in hungary seem to have been given some encouragement .
on the points of environmental policy , rubbish sorting and recycling , and water usage , there exist local directives , but there can often be a shortage of implementation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new nuclear power plant in normandy is more efficient , safer and more environmentally friendly than current models .
the french are struggling with a completely different problem : since the recent sharp rise in oil prices the country is becoming more and more reliant on nuclear energy .
independence from crude oil is an argument for those who are fans of nuclear power .
permit-trading of dangerous substances the environmental policy in europe should help to reduce the emission of harmful substances .
the beginning of 2005 will see the start of an emission trading system between the eu 's 25 member states .
the first multinational emission trading system in the world is the cornerstone of the eu 's objective to fulfil the targets of the kyoto protocol .
between 2008 and 2012 , an 8 percent reduction in levels of carbon dioxide emissions is to be achieved , compared to 1990 levels . petra kohnen -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin signs up russia for kyoto pact russian president vladimir putin put his signature to the un 's kyoto climate change treaty on friday , just over a week after his country 's parliament voted to ratify the document , the kremlin said .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .
croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .
while the first period had few noteworthy incidents the first ten minutes of the second half were action packed . with 49 minutes gone inter 's argentine julio cruz pressed the self-destruct button fouling ludovic magnin as a corner from the right was delivered and referee gilles veissiere pointed to the spot .
french defender ismael -lrb- photo -rrb- , sent off in the opening 2-0 loss against inter in milan , stepped up to slot home the spot-kick . inter stage magic comeback the celebrations at the weserstadion were short-lived though as they were carved apart by a moment of magic from serbia and montenegro star stankovic six minutes later .
stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

ajax 's 1-0 defeat to juventus in turin means bayern finish runners-up in group c behind the italians and the bundesliga leaders can now plan for the knockout phase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach felix magath .
bayern coach felix magath was delighted with the display and the fact that the final away match against ajax on december 8 has nothing at stake .
" we stuttered at the beginning but after that we dominated proceedings , " explained magath .
" the final game is irrelevant as we can not finish top of the group or slip from second . " pizarro curler opens flood gates magath called for the killer instinct in front of goal and his team delivered scoring with their first shot on target after 12 minutes .
peruvian claudio pizarro cut inside and unleashed a 20 yard shot that arrowed into the top right hand corner .
still basking in their goal bayern almost conceded a shock equaliser when salem abo siam 's attempted cross ricocheted off the top of oliver kahn 's crossbar . bosnian international hasan salihamidzic relieved the tension at the olympic stadium netting on 37 minutes although he knew very little about it .
tel aviv goalkeeper liran strauber parried a goal-bound header onto the chest of salihamidzic who was virtually on the goal-line . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack , left , and torsten frings .
magath brought off bastian schweinsteiger and the injured owen hargreaves but it did not spare tel-aviv from the constant munich pressure .
with just a minute to go before the interval german international torsten frings -lrb- photo , with michael ballack -rrb- produced a rasping right-footed volley that left strauber with no chance . after the break bayern used the last of their three substitutions with playmaker sebastian deisler introduced as he continues his recovery from depression . consolation goal before makaay seals it despite the fresh legs bayern eased off and tel-aviv made them pay with their first away goal in this season 's champions league .
kahn inexplicably felled barukh dego in the penalty area after 55 minutes with the maccabi striker going gown a cul-de-sac .
dego got up to convert the resulting penalty sending kahn the wrong way . however , a comeback was never on the cards and dutch marksman roy makaay netted his fifth champions league goal with 71 minutes gone . leverkusen 's progress halted in madrid real madrid and bayer leverkusen fought out an exciting 1-1 draw to leave qualification from champions league group b still up in the air for both sides on tuesday .
" of course i wanted to go back to germany with a win because then we could have relaxed for the last game but a draw is still good , " said bayer coach klaus augenthaler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's dimitar berbatov celebrates with carsten ramelow .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .

" inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .

initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the chinese be persuaded to part with their hard earned yuan for private health insurance ?
picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .
providing the initial entry into the market is successful , it is hoped that a role out of the service could occur across china . kateri jochum -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform after drastic cost-cutting steps imposed earlier this year , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- aim to expand the revenue basis for the national health service .

a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "

picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.11.2004 the real drama of berlin opera großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : west berlin 's answer to opera berlin 's three opera houses are no strangers to eluding closure and nursing the wounds of financial incision .
although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .
a few blocks down the road , the komische oper has built up a reputation for music theater and stages all its performances in german .
and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .
they know how much money is at their collective disposal over the next five years - € 113.6 million -lrb- $ 149.5 million -rrb- for 2004 , to be gradually reduced to € 96.8 million in 2009 - and can plan and perform accordingly .
strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .
after an embarrassing debacle which involved berlin 's minister of culture , thomas flierl , commissioning a sneaky piece of reporting into fülle 's background , the latter withdrew his candidature .
that just leaves schindhelm , who is currently facing allegations of a past as an informer for the east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- .
before his application can move onto the next phase , his stasi files are to be scrutinized by a specially appointed committee .
if they find nothing worthy of great outcry , he will be invited to present himself and his viability to the opera foundation committee .
it 's a bureaucratic merry-go-round , but if he can hold on through all the stopping and starting without falling off , maybe he is just the man for the job . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brawling in bayreuth just days before the premiere of the feverishly awaited new staging of richard wagner 's opera " parsifal " at this year 's bayreuth festival , the leading tenor hit out at the production and its controversial director .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .
croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .
while the first period had few noteworthy incidents the first ten minutes of the second half were action packed . with 49 minutes gone inter 's argentine julio cruz pressed the self-destruct button fouling ludovic magnin as a corner from the right was delivered and referee gilles veissiere pointed to the spot .
french defender ismael -lrb- photo -rrb- , sent off in the opening 2-0 loss against inter in milan , stepped up to slot home the spot-kick . inter stage magic comeback the celebrations at the weserstadion were short-lived though as they were carved apart by a moment of magic from serbia and montenegro star stankovic six minutes later .
stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

the eu has around 500 directives that relate to environmental and climate protection .
these regulations have often proved successful , but have also led to a number of difficulties in member states . germany is often cited as a model for the environmental sector .
ninety-two percent of germans regard the environment as being an important topic , according to a study by germany 's top state-run environmental agencies .
german enthusiasm for environmental protection , which had fallen in the 1990s , appears to be on the rise again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both new and renovated homes will have to contain proper insulation , as an energy saving measure .
this increased environmental conscience has been reinforced by a number of new laws .
anyone deciding to build a new house or to redevelop an existing one , for example , is now bound by the energy saving directive that insists on sufficient thermal insulation being used .
this , naturally , reduces the amount of thermal energy that is lost , reducing energy usage , and saving the householder on energy bills .
fixed price for green electricity germany has also introduced an energy usage law , which was drawn up to increase the amount of solar , wind , water and biogas energy pumped into the electricity market .
consumers that use an eco-electricity company not only benefit from state subsidies but also a fixed price for every kilowatt hour they consume from the national grid .
germans are also world leaders when it comes to sorting rubbish .
they want an end to the use of atomic energy , are full subscribers to the kyoto protocol and are the first nation in europe to have elected a green party as partners in a coalition government .
environmental policies are high on the national agenda .
less enthusiasm elsewhere that 's not so much the case in britain , even though the country , at least as far as following eu directives goes , ranks high in environmental protection . the disposal of rubbish like refrigerators , for instance , has led to many problems in the island nation . the british parliament failed to pass legislation to ensure that the harmful gases emitted from refrigerators are dealt with adequately .
as a result , the whole country is full of old refrigerators awaiting proper disposal .
illegal discharges each year britain emits around five million tons of toxic waste , which were dumped next to household rubbish until recently .

arbitration discussions between the parties have failed and the church leaders have made it clear that negotiations are over . the row revolves around an increase of tarmac by 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse in france and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension is of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant is threatened with huge losses . loss of airbus work threatens plant the new flagship airplanes arriving for prep work for delivery would have to go elsewhere , resulting in the loss of around 100 jobs and could lead to hamburg losing its place as a major center in the worldwide aviation construction industry .
this in turn would see the loss of even more jobs from the 7,000-strong workforce which would be relocated to other airbus plants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg-neuenfelde church at the center of the storm .
so far , the opposition has retained the upper hand despite a split between the church elders .
bishop maria jespen has expressed her “ exceptional annoyance ” at the refusal of the other members of the parish council to continue discussions over selling the property .
but the upper administrative court in hamburg decided in favor of the church ’ s majority decision at an initial hearing in august and stopped construction of the extended runway .
airbus responded by upping its compensation payment by € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.95 million -rrb- . parent group considers french relocation this weekend will see crisis talks take place in a bid to resolve the dispute and save the future of the hamburg plant .
should there be no compromise , the a380 will have to find another home , with the production plant in toulouse ready to accept the extra work . " if the runway extension does begin in november , we can ready and deliver the airplanes in toulouse " , rainer hertrich , head of airbus parent group eads , threatened in an interview with the daily berliner zeitung .
relocation to the french location would not prove problematic , heinrich added . a380 signals intent in boeing battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 super-jumbo .
the construction of the a380 is the loudest statement of intent from airbus in its battle with us rival boeing .
while boeing is still the number one in terms of turnover , airbus could edge out its competitor in the civil aviation market with the new super-jumbo .
the a380 has an order book currently standing at a confirmed 129 planes with many more interested parties waiting in the wings . the a380 takes its maiden voyage in the spring of 2005 .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .

airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension was seen as one of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant would have been threatened with huge losses . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus hamburg in crisis over church land row the hamburg aviation plant responsible for preparing and delivering the new airbus a380 super-jumbo could lose the privilege if a local church council succeeds in blocking the extension of the plant 's runway .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension was seen as one of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant would have been threatened with huge losses . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus hamburg in crisis over church land row the hamburg aviation plant responsible for preparing and delivering the new airbus a380 super-jumbo could lose the privilege if a local church council succeeds in blocking the extension of the plant 's runway .

anyone visiting the city today will literally stumble over traces of ancient history at nearly every corner . trier is the oldest city in germany .
roman emperor augustus established " augusta treverorum " in the year 16 bc .
these days , the citiy 's 2,000-year-old history attracts masses of tourists . until the fifth century , trier was the capital of the west-roman empire .
as a result , the remaining buildings are monumental : the amphitheater , which accommodated 30,000 people , the extensive thermal springs , the north gate of the roman city wall - today 's porta nigra - and the enormous hall of the basilica , which became a royal residence after the conquest by the franconians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trier was not damaged during world war two the ancient trier was a large , pulsating city and a center of trade with road and river connections to all regions of europe . from metropolis to province after the departure of the romans , the city became one of the most important ecclesiastical and secular centers .
the archbishops of trier were also princes : they elected the emperor and played an important role in political decisions during imperial assemblies . traces of their power and influence can be found in the elaborate places of worship and the city 's renaissance , baroque and rococo palaces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main market place forms trier 's city center after the french revolutionary wars , trier became the district city of the rhine province , far away from the prussian center of government in berlin . the 19th century industrial boom , which ensured an upswing almost everywhere , failed to arrive in trier - the necessary conditions were missing . its lack of industrial infrastructure proved to be an advantage for trier in the 20th century as it did not become a target for allied destruction during the two world wars .
the historical buildings that remain draw thousands of tourists each years . trier 's famous son bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx was born in trier in 1818 many visitors also stop by the karl marx house on brückenstrasse .

this increased environmental conscience has been reinforced by a number of new laws .
anyone deciding to build a new house or to redevelop an existing one , for example , is now bound by the energy saving directive that insists on sufficient thermal insulation being used .
this , naturally , reduces the amount of thermal energy that is lost , reducing energy usage , and saving the householder on energy bills .
fixed price for green electricity germany has also introduced an energy usage law , which was drawn up to increase the amount of solar , wind , water and biogas energy pumped into the electricity market .

" it will mean an unavoidable reduction in the space available at the dump sites , which is to be expected in the early stages -lrb- of the new directive 's -rrb- introduction .
yes , we will begin to increase the number of landfill sites available , and when the needs for the disposal of toxic waste increases , the industry will surely react . "
the government hopes that the new directives that industry is currently bringing on stream , will lead to less poisonous waste being generated .
but it does depend on the necessary legislation and the industry 's readiness to organize itself on how best to deal with the disposal of harmful substances .
discussions on how the decontamination of poisonous substances can be brought under control with the help of tax measures have been going on for years .

explore cologne and beyond düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past a picturesque pedal down the rhine essen : a changing industrial landscape cities -pipe- 25.11.2004 koblenz : good for getting over jet lag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koblenz 's deutsches eck is a highlight on any rhine boat tour recovering from a long-haul flight can take some time .
koblenz 's handful of sites nearly fill the day but still leave time for a nap before dinner for the jet-lagged traveler . the first day of a long-awaited vacation is all too often nothing but a murky collage of impressions .
but a trip to -lrb- and a nap in -rrb- koblenz , the only german city on both the moselle and rhine rivers , offers a good alternative to stumbling half-asleep though a big city . just over an hour train ride from frankfurt international airport , the city 's landmarks and the region 's tasty wines make it an ideal starting point to shift into tourist gear . upon arrival , choose between a quick ride on bus line 1 , which leaves from the train station , or a 20-minute walk through the city 's main shopping avenues and past numerous cafes offering a jolt of caffeine before you arrive at koblenz 's tourist highlight . rivers meet at german corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koblenz 's most famous landmark , and much of the town , was flooded in january 2003 without a doubt , the city 's most famous monument is deutsches eck -lrb- german corner -rrb- .
the spot where the moselle flows into the rhine owes its name to the teutonic order of knights who founded a settlement here in 1216 . though the bronze replica of kaiser wilhelm i - the original from 1897 was destroyed during the world war ii - seems to fit in perfectly with the 16 flags on the triangular piece of land that juts into the two rivers , the pedestal actually stood empty from 1953 to 1990 as a reminder of divided germany .
it was n't until 1993 that a the copy was put in place . a new city with 2,000 years history across the rhine and a short chair-lift ride 118 meters -lrb- 387 feet -rrb- up the river 's steep banks , the ehrenbreitstein fortress keeps watch from the top of the cliffs .
originally built around the year 1000 , romans , franks , the french and prussians all guarded the fortifications that are now home to a state museum and youth hostel . the view from ehrenbreitstein reveals koblenz as a new , rebuilt city .
though the city of 100,000 was originally founded in the ninth century , bombing during world war ii reduced the historic center to rubble .
the only building left standing was the pink deutscher kaiser inn , which is still open to the public . plenty to see on the rhine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks safe now , but the rhine 's lorelei was the downfall of many sailors one of the main reasons to visit koblenz is tied to the rhine 's river banks .
that 's where the city 's ships line up to offer visitors floating tours lasting from one hour to one day . while the observant traveler may already have seen the vineyards and castles that dot the river 's banks on the train ride from frankfurt , the landscape makes for interesting pictures hard to find anywhere else in germany and the boat 's gentle rocking make it good place for a quick nap .
do n't worry , though , the clicking of cameras will wake you up when you get to the famous lorelei . according to sailors ' legend , it was at this curve in the river that a beautiful woman would lounge alongside the river , combing her long blonde hair , driving the ships ' men to distraction and leading them to crash on the rocks below .
these days , however , sunburn poses more of a danger than the wide river 's rocky bottom . rejuvenated and back in town after the cruise , the city 's many churches and pedestrian squares are ideal for meandering and the half-timbered houses of the weindorf -lrb- wine village -rrb- offer an ambiance suited to sampling the region 's renowned rhine and moselle wines as well as some local gastronomic specialties before nodding off for the day . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the city of koblenz information in english about koblenz and a virtual guided tour of what the city has to offer .

but a trip to -lrb- and a nap in -rrb- koblenz , the only german city on both the moselle and rhine rivers , offers a good alternative to stumbling half-asleep though a big city . just over an hour train ride from frankfurt international airport , the city 's landmarks and the region 's tasty wines make it an ideal starting point to shift into tourist gear . upon arrival , choose between a quick ride on bus line 1 , which leaves from the train station , or a 20-minute walk through the city 's main shopping avenues and past numerous cafes offering a jolt of caffeine before you arrive at koblenz 's tourist highlight . rivers meet at german corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koblenz 's most famous landmark , and much of the town , was flooded in january 2003 without a doubt , the city 's most famous monument is deutsches eck -lrb- german corner -rrb- .
the spot where the moselle flows into the rhine owes its name to the teutonic order of knights who founded a settlement here in 1216 . though the bronze replica of kaiser wilhelm i - the original from 1897 was destroyed during the world war ii - seems to fit in perfectly with the 16 flags on the triangular piece of land that juts into the two rivers , the pedestal actually stood empty from 1953 to 1990 as a reminder of divided germany .

originally built around the year 1000 , romans , franks , the french and prussians all guarded the fortifications that are now home to a state museum and youth hostel . the view from ehrenbreitstein reveals koblenz as a new , rebuilt city .
though the city of 100,000 was originally founded in the ninth century , bombing during world war ii reduced the historic center to rubble .
the only building left standing was the pink deutscher kaiser inn , which is still open to the public . plenty to see on the rhine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks safe now , but the rhine 's lorelei was the downfall of many sailors one of the main reasons to visit koblenz is tied to the rhine 's river banks .
that 's where the city 's ships line up to offer visitors floating tours lasting from one hour to one day . while the observant traveler may already have seen the vineyards and castles that dot the river 's banks on the train ride from frankfurt , the landscape makes for interesting pictures hard to find anywhere else in germany and the boat 's gentle rocking make it good place for a quick nap .

but a trip to -lrb- and a nap in -rrb- koblenz , the only german city on both the moselle and rhine rivers , offers a good alternative to stumbling half-asleep though a big city . just over an hour train ride from frankfurt international airport , the city 's landmarks and the region 's tasty wines make it an ideal starting point to shift into tourist gear . upon arrival , choose between a quick ride on bus line 1 , which leaves from the train station , or a 20-minute walk through the city 's main shopping avenues and past numerous cafes offering a jolt of caffeine before you arrive at koblenz 's tourist highlight . rivers meet at german corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koblenz 's most famous landmark , and much of the town , was flooded in january 2003 without a doubt , the city 's most famous monument is deutsches eck -lrb- german corner -rrb- .
the spot where the moselle flows into the rhine owes its name to the teutonic order of knights who founded a settlement here in 1216 . though the bronze replica of kaiser wilhelm i - the original from 1897 was destroyed during the world war ii - seems to fit in perfectly with the 16 flags on the triangular piece of land that juts into the two rivers , the pedestal actually stood empty from 1953 to 1990 as a reminder of divided germany .

originally built around the year 1000 , romans , franks , the french and prussians all guarded the fortifications that are now home to a state museum and youth hostel . the view from ehrenbreitstein reveals koblenz as a new , rebuilt city .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .

croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .

stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the chinese be persuaded to part with their hard earned yuan for private health insurance ?
picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .
providing the initial entry into the market is successful , it is hoped that a role out of the service could occur across china . kateri jochum -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats propose sweeping health-care reform after drastic cost-cutting steps imposed earlier this year , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- aim to expand the revenue basis for the national health service .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .
this explains why private health insurance currently makes up a mere 6 percent of the entire market .
but now , beijing wants to develop specialized health insurance and is employing european know-how to get the system started .
messemer said he hopes to profit from the expertise his company has gained in what were underdeveloped markets in belgium and spain .
but he also said that entry into china means breaking into new territory .
a budding market " the market for health insurance here is around € 2 to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 to $ 3.9 billion -rrb- , " he said .
" the question is , how fast will the market continue to grow ?
in the past few years it has grown by 50 percent each year , just as many other markets have .
two billion euros is nothing considering the size of the potential market .
health insurance as we know it doesn ’ t actually exist .
so , from that point of view , we think that a very large market could develop .
some estimates says it will reach € 38 billion by 2010 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the chinese be persuaded to part with their hard earned yuan for private health insurance ?
picc health , as the newly founded company is called , began with € 100 million in capital stock and messemer estimates that the company will break even within the next two to four years .
predictions are difficult , and the borders between the private and public sectors are not always clear cut .
after decades of public health care , the chinese may be slow in the take-up of private health insurance .
" there is an existing public health insurance system , and in the past it provided the services - especially in the country ’ s rural regions , " he said .
" the system is changing at the moment ...
it will of course be challenging to be a part of developing health insurance for a market where the role of service provider is changing so dramatically . "
starting next year , messemer hopes to sell the first health insurance policies , initially in larger cities like beijing .

a german health insurance company is about to make its debut onto the rapidly expanding chinese health insurance market . the battle over revamping the german national health care system has divided political parties in germany for years .
in that time , health care benefits have been reduced , and fees increased .
private health insurance companies have grabbed this opportunity , offering supplementary insurance packages .
but germany isn ’ t the only country where the system is changing .
in communist-governed china , the issue of private health care has increasingly become an issue .
now , for the first time , the chinese government has allowed a foreign company access to its health insurance market .
the deutsche krankenversicherung -lrb- dkv -rrb- has acquired a 19 percent stake in the first private health insurance company in china - the most holding power any foreign investor is allowed .
majority partner is a state company , the people 's insurance company of china -lrb- picc -rrb- , one of china ’ s largest insurance companies .
a high demand dkv board member jochen messemer , who is responsible for the company ’ s international activities , said he was pleased with the speedy contract settlement .
" we think that the time has come to enter this market in china , especially with a partner like picc , which has a large network of sales agents , " he said .
" there is a high demand for private health care in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is now the land of great opportunity for many western firms .
until now , chinese citizens could only acquire private health coverage in a package - with life insurance , for example .

bremen have ten points compared to valencia 's seven and have already defeated the spaniards 2-1 . however , a 1-0 win for claudio ranieri 's valencia side will send bremen crashing out .
" the team went forward for the 90 minutes and showed how much they wanted to win , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we have our fate in our own hands and that is important " werder midfielder fabian ernst added , " it is all or nothing now . " inter fielded a so-called reserve team having already qualified for the next stage but the presence of dutch international edgar davids , argentine international javier zanetti and italian striking ace christian vieri underlined their strength-in-depth .
vieri was put clean through on goal after five minutes but lost his footing at the crucial moment to the relief of the bremen supporters . the hosts probed but did not create their first opening until the 28th minute .
croat ivan klasnic whipped an inviting cross for strike partner miroslav klose but the german international headed wide of the post . inter saw little of the ball but looked dangerous on the counter attack and argentine midfielder estaban cambiasso came close near half-time with his shot whistling past the post of bremen goalkeeper andreas reinke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's valerien ismael .
while the first period had few noteworthy incidents the first ten minutes of the second half were action packed . with 49 minutes gone inter 's argentine julio cruz pressed the self-destruct button fouling ludovic magnin as a corner from the right was delivered and referee gilles veissiere pointed to the spot .
french defender ismael -lrb- photo -rrb- , sent off in the opening 2-0 loss against inter in milan , stepped up to slot home the spot-kick . inter stage magic comeback the celebrations at the weserstadion were short-lived though as they were carved apart by a moment of magic from serbia and montenegro star stankovic six minutes later .
stankovic produced a sublime chip that rebounded off the post and nigerian substitute martins , only on the pitch for three minutes , reacted first to bullet in a header . " bremen really wanted to beat us but my team stood firm , " said inter coach roberto mancini .
" i was happy with the display and think the draw was a fair result . " klose went close for bremen late on with a header but francesco toldo produced a low save to keep the scores all square .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension was seen as one of paramount importance .
without it , the airbus plant would have been threatened with huge losses . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus hamburg in crisis over church land row the hamburg aviation plant responsible for preparing and delivering the new airbus a380 super-jumbo could lose the privilege if a local church council succeeds in blocking the extension of the plant 's runway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.11.2004 the real drama of berlin opera großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : west berlin 's answer to opera berlin 's three opera houses are no strangers to eluding closure and nursing the wounds of financial incision .
although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .
a few blocks down the road , the komische oper has built up a reputation for music theater and stages all its performances in german .
and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .
they know how much money is at their collective disposal over the next five years - € 113.6 million -lrb- $ 149.5 million -rrb- for 2004 , to be gradually reduced to € 96.8 million in 2009 - and can plan and perform accordingly .
strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .
after an embarrassing debacle which involved berlin 's minister of culture , thomas flierl , commissioning a sneaky piece of reporting into fülle 's background , the latter withdrew his candidature .

although they are currently on safe ground , they 're having to learn to sing for their supper in unison . as the only city in the world with three opera houses in its cultural repertoire , berlin is sitting on a genuine gem .
but making it dazzle to full potential is not entirely straightforward .
the reality is that bright lights and fanfare cost money , berlin is broke , and culture is desirable prey for the swooping hand of municipal cost-cutting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from john neumeier 's ballet interpretation of " midsummer night 's dream " yet somehow , and maybe against the odds , the operatic trio has managed to secure its continued existence .
thus far at least .
unlike the city 's ballet , which was compressed from three into one at the end of last year , opera in the german capital enjoys the backing of a strong lobby , and nobody really wants to see any one ensemble forced into a final bow .
but change is of the essence if the music is to keep flowing .
" right now the attitude is , ' oh goodness , we 've got three opera houses , what shall we do with them , " ' torsten wöhlert , the spokesman for the city state 's minister of culture , told dw-world .
" that has to change , and tourists coming to berlin have to start coming for the opera as well as the museums . "
competition versus co-operation at the end of last year , berlin 's ministry of culture took the somewhat controversial step of creating a foundation , stiftung oper in berlin , or berlin opera foundation , to bring all three opera houses under one financial roof .
" the alternative would have been to close one of them down or to dispense with of one of the ensembles , " wöhlert said .
and that would have been akin to selecting a lamb for the slaughter , not least because each of the three sings to its own tune and is in no way superfluous to the classical music landscape of the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the staatsoper has a long tradition of musical endeavor the staatsoper unter den linden in the eastern part of the city , has been seducing opera-lovers since the days of prussian king friedrich ii .
a few blocks down the road , the komische oper has built up a reputation for music theater and stages all its performances in german .
and last but not least , the deutsche oper is the genre representative in the former west of the city .
under the umbrella of the foundation , the three opera houses , the berlin state ballet and a centralized stage service have had to forsake large parts of their egos and learn to work together towards developing a kind of co-operative competition .
they know how much money is at their collective disposal over the next five years - € 113.6 million -lrb- $ 149.5 million -rrb- for 2004 , to be gradually reduced to € 96.8 million in 2009 - and can plan and perform accordingly .
strength in numbers it was quite a departure for three institutions but so far the virtues of the foundation have not gone unsung .
" all three opera houses are very different and they compliment one another brilliantly , " andre kraft , spokesman for the komische oper , told dw-world .
" it is a competitive situation , but it 's also very fruitful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from mozart 's " abduction from the seraglio " at the komische oper .
the foundation offers the trio the chance to coordinate performance plans , find ways of saving money together and come up with effective structures which do n't impinge on the current high levels of artistic engagement .
the missing puppeteer what the foundation has not yet been able to offer berlin 's musical majesties is a permanent general director to oversee the whole operation .
" it 's a difficult position because although the general director wo n't have the freedom to intervene artistically , he must come from the performance world , " said elsa blanke , who works for the berlin opera foundation .
a creative mind with the power to budget sounds like something of a thankless task .
and although wöhlert made it plain that a cost-cutter would be nothing if not inadequately matched to the vacant post , anyone who rises to the challenge will have to wave the baton of fiscal control in a pretty vigorous manner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schindhelm is now the sole candidate to run the foundation so just where is the foundation going to find the perfect fit ?
until a couple of weeks ago there were two candidates in the running - the director of the basel theater , michael schindhelm , and the managing director of frankfurt theaters , bernd fülle .
after an embarrassing debacle which involved berlin 's minister of culture , thomas flierl , commissioning a sneaky piece of reporting into fülle 's background , the latter withdrew his candidature .
that just leaves schindhelm , who is currently facing allegations of a past as an informer for the east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- .
before his application can move onto the next phase , his stasi files are to be scrutinized by a specially appointed committee .
if they find nothing worthy of great outcry , he will be invited to present himself and his viability to the opera foundation committee .
it 's a bureaucratic merry-go-round , but if he can hold on through all the stopping and starting without falling off , maybe he is just the man for the job . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brawling in bayreuth just days before the premiere of the feverishly awaited new staging of richard wagner 's opera " parsifal " at this year 's bayreuth festival , the leading tenor hit out at the production and its controversial director .

giscard d 'estaing argued that turkish entry to the eu would " change the nature of the european project , " adding that ankara would be the " major decision-maker in the eu " due to its large population size .
he also warned that allowing turkey to join the eu could result in a clutch of other countries clamoring for entry .
" there is already a queue forming to the east and west , " said the former french president .
" morocco would probably be tempted to follow turkey 's example .
this could result in a process of permanent enlargement , destabilizing the operations of the european system and removing its original rationale . "
the comments follow a campaign by the german opposition cdu party to offer a " privileged partnership " to turkey .
the debate is increasing in intensity as eu leaders prepare to decide whether to open accession negotiations with turkey at a crucial summit in brussels on dec .

ireland 's ambassador anne anderson formally tabled a proposal at a meeting of eu ambassadors in brussels on wednesday .
the proposal stops short of asking that all documents be translated into irish .
" we recognize that there is a problem with the linguistic services - that they are overworked , " said an irish diplomat .
instead , for a temporary period of four years , irish would have a status similar to that of maltese which means that while joint regulations adopted by the council and parliament would be translated into irish , rulings from the european court of justice would not .
this proposal , if agreed by the member states , would represent a significant positive and practical step forward for the irish language in the eu , " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern on wednesday .
according to sources , reactions from other member states were generally positive .
ireland 's application , which has to be formally approved by all 25 member states before it can go into effect , is expected to strongly influence a similar debate in spain .
there is large political pressure in spain to have regional languages such as catalan , basque and galician recognized at the eu level .
for its part , ireland is hoping to move " as fast as possible " to see irish as an official eu language .

in an interview with the hamburger abendblatt daily schmidt said that the ideal of a " multicultural society " is impossible in germany .
" as a result , it was a mistake that we began bringing people in from foreign cultures , " the social democrat said . the former chancellor -lrb- 1974-1982 -rrb- was referring to the cheap " guest workers " invited into the country from abroad - primarily from turkey - in the 1960s .
the remarks earned angry replies from politicians , some of them immigrants and the children of immigrants themselves .
" it is a slap in the face , " social democratic parliamentarian lale akgün , who came to germany in 1962 , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" this an insult to my parents ' generation , " said green party parliamentarian ekin deligöz .
" foreign workers contributed a lot to the well-being of our country , " said cardinal karl lehmann .

the index had remained more or less stable during the preceding three months .
the fall this month was much steeper than analysts had been expecting - consensus forecasts had foreseen a fall in the index of 0.5 point .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls around 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .

although no final decision had been made , the senate had re-opened talks that had allowed both sides in the dispute to move closer to an agreement , with the land owners ’ agreeing in principle to the sale of property needed for the construction work . the announcement comes just a day after the latest negotiations between airbus , the hamburg senate and the church municipality had failed .
airbus officials had remained firm on their proposed 589 meter -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- extension , which would bring the runway to a total of 3,200 meters in length , and the creation of the delivery center which would create 100 new jobs . the senate took this into consideration along with the fact that without the new facilities and extended runway , the hamburg plant could potentially lose the airbus contract and put 2,500 to 4,000 jobs in peril . expansion dates pencilled in the landowners ’ agreement to sell in principle will pave the way for the runway extension and delivery center construction to begin in 2006 with a completion date pencilled in for 2007 .
the new a380 super-jumbos will be temporarily prepared for delivery at the airbus plant in toulouse , france , until hamburg is up to spec . the proposal to lengthen the existing runway had run into serious and stubborn opposition from the local parish council of the municipality of neuenfelde , which resolutely refused to sell any of its land to accommodate the extension .
initial arbitration discussions between the parties had failed and the church leaders had made it clear that negotiations were over . the row revolved around an increase of tarmac which would encroach on fruit plantations and the outer limits of the community .
for the new a380s to arrive from their main production center in toulouse and leave from the german factory on the boundaries of the hanseatic town , this extension was seen as one of paramount importance .

explore cologne and beyond düsseldorf : stop , shop and stroll the ruhr valley : touring germany 's industrial past a picturesque pedal down the rhine essen : a changing industrial landscape cities -pipe- 25.11.2004 koblenz : good for getting over jet lag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koblenz 's deutsches eck is a highlight on any rhine boat tour recovering from a long-haul flight can take some time .
koblenz 's handful of sites nearly fill the day but still leave time for a nap before dinner for the jet-lagged traveler . the first day of a long-awaited vacation is all too often nothing but a murky collage of impressions .
but a trip to -lrb- and a nap in -rrb- koblenz , the only german city on both the moselle and rhine rivers , offers a good alternative to stumbling half-asleep though a big city . just over an hour train ride from frankfurt international airport , the city 's landmarks and the region 's tasty wines make it an ideal starting point to shift into tourist gear . upon arrival , choose between a quick ride on bus line 1 , which leaves from the train station , or a 20-minute walk through the city 's main shopping avenues and past numerous cafes offering a jolt of caffeine before you arrive at koblenz 's tourist highlight . rivers meet at german corner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koblenz 's most famous landmark , and much of the town , was flooded in january 2003 without a doubt , the city 's most famous monument is deutsches eck -lrb- german corner -rrb- .
the spot where the moselle flows into the rhine owes its name to the teutonic order of knights who founded a settlement here in 1216 . though the bronze replica of kaiser wilhelm i - the original from 1897 was destroyed during the world war ii - seems to fit in perfectly with the 16 flags on the triangular piece of land that juts into the two rivers , the pedestal actually stood empty from 1953 to 1990 as a reminder of divided germany .
it was n't until 1993 that a the copy was put in place . a new city with 2,000 years history across the rhine and a short chair-lift ride 118 meters -lrb- 387 feet -rrb- up the river 's steep banks , the ehrenbreitstein fortress keeps watch from the top of the cliffs .
originally built around the year 1000 , romans , franks , the french and prussians all guarded the fortifications that are now home to a state museum and youth hostel . the view from ehrenbreitstein reveals koblenz as a new , rebuilt city .
though the city of 100,000 was originally founded in the ninth century , bombing during world war ii reduced the historic center to rubble .
the only building left standing was the pink deutscher kaiser inn , which is still open to the public . plenty to see on the rhine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks safe now , but the rhine 's lorelei was the downfall of many sailors one of the main reasons to visit koblenz is tied to the rhine 's river banks .
that 's where the city 's ships line up to offer visitors floating tours lasting from one hour to one day . while the observant traveler may already have seen the vineyards and castles that dot the river 's banks on the train ride from frankfurt , the landscape makes for interesting pictures hard to find anywhere else in germany and the boat 's gentle rocking make it good place for a quick nap .
do n't worry , though , the clicking of cameras will wake you up when you get to the famous lorelei . according to sailors ' legend , it was at this curve in the river that a beautiful woman would lounge alongside the river , combing her long blonde hair , driving the ships ' men to distraction and leading them to crash on the rocks below .
these days , however , sunburn poses more of a danger than the wide river 's rocky bottom . rejuvenated and back in town after the cruise , the city 's many churches and pedestrian squares are ideal for meandering and the half-timbered houses of the weindorf -lrb- wine village -rrb- offer an ambiance suited to sampling the region 's renowned rhine and moselle wines as well as some local gastronomic specialties before nodding off for the day . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the city of koblenz information in english about koblenz and a virtual guided tour of what the city has to offer .

only about half of the population in england is registered with a surgery so ministers are freeing up dentists ' time by changing the way they work .
what is the problem ?
last year , there was a shortage of 1,850 dentists .
at the moment just 17m adults and 7m children in england - about half the population - are registered with a dentist .
in some places , dentist surgeries have stopped taking on new patients as their lists are full .
it is not known exactly how many people have been denied access but it is clear action is needed after images of people queuing to register with dentists have been regularly featured in the media over recent years .
how is the government tackling the problem ?
ministers are reforming the way nhs dentistry works .
from october 2005 , primary care trusts are being given responsibility for commissioning dentists to do work .
instead of being paid for each nhs treatment they carry out , dentists will be given a guaranteed income based on their historical income - estimated to be in the region of an average of £ 69,000 a year - for three years for providing services to the local community .
it will mean dentists will no longer have to carry out treatment to be paid - a situation which led some to claim dentists were over-treating their patients .
under the plans , dentists will be expected to spend more time addressing preventative measures .
this will mean they will be freed from time-consuming treatment and , theoretically , treat more patients .
on top of that , the government wants to recruit an extra 1,000 dentists by the time the new arrangements come into place .
will patients have to pay more ?
perhaps .
at the moment nhs patients currently pay 80 % of the fee up to £ 378 , although some patients , such as those on benefits , are exempt .
one of the criticisms of the current system is that patients often have no idea of how much the treatment is going to cost until it is finished .
details of the new arrangements have not been published yet but the government says it wants to introduce a simpler system .
it is widely expected to be based around a band system , meaning some patients could pay more while others pay less .
will all dentists sign up to the reform programme ?
there are 19,300 dentists working in the nhs either under the general dental service or personal dental service contract .
the new arrangements will replace both systems and while dentists are not compelled to sign up to it - they work as independent contractors - the government is confident most will .
however , the national audit office has warned dentists may reduce their nhs commitment as they are sceptical about the plans .
so will the changes make a difference ?
the government hopes so but there are some concerns .
the nao has said primary care trusts do not have the necessary expertise .

only about half of the population in england is registered with a surgery so ministers are freeing up dentists ' time by changing the way they work .
what is the problem ?
last year , there was a shortage of 1,850 dentists .
at the moment just 17m adults and 7m children in england - about half the population - are registered with a dentist .
in some places , dentist surgeries have stopped taking on new patients as their lists are full .
it is not known exactly how many people have been denied access but it is clear action is needed after images of people queuing to register with dentists have been regularly featured in the media over recent years .
how is the government tackling the problem ?
ministers are reforming the way nhs dentistry works .
from october 2005 , primary care trusts are being given responsibility for commissioning dentists to do work .
instead of being paid for each nhs treatment they carry out , dentists will be given a guaranteed income based on their historical income - estimated to be in the region of an average of £ 69,000 a year - for three years for providing services to the local community .
it will mean dentists will no longer have to carry out treatment to be paid - a situation which led some to claim dentists were over-treating their patients .
under the plans , dentists will be expected to spend more time addressing preventative measures .
this will mean they will be freed from time-consuming treatment and , theoretically , treat more patients .
on top of that , the government wants to recruit an extra 1,000 dentists by the time the new arrangements come into place .
will patients have to pay more ?
perhaps .
at the moment nhs patients currently pay 80 % of the fee up to £ 378 , although some patients , such as those on benefits , are exempt .
one of the criticisms of the current system is that patients often have no idea of how much the treatment is going to cost until it is finished .
details of the new arrangements have not been published yet but the government says it wants to introduce a simpler system .
it is widely expected to be based around a band system , meaning some patients could pay more while others pay less .
will all dentists sign up to the reform programme ?
there are 19,300 dentists working in the nhs either under the general dental service or personal dental service contract .
the new arrangements will replace both systems and while dentists are not compelled to sign up to it - they work as independent contractors - the government is confident most will .
however , the national audit office has warned dentists may reduce their nhs commitment as they are sceptical about the plans .
so will the changes make a difference ?
the government hopes so but there are some concerns .
the nao has said primary care trusts do not have the necessary expertise .
and a poll by the british dental association found just one in 10 dentists had confidence their pct could cope with their new responsibilities .
there are also suggestions that as dentists will not be compelled to treat more patients - it will be left to the pct to negotiate this - some may just stick to treating their current patients safe in the knowledge that their income is protected for three years .

the proposed changes into the way dentists are paid could mean they do even less work for the nhs , according to a damning report by the national audit office .
this morning , breakfast asks : why is dentistry in britain so difficult ?
sophie hutchinson reported live from a dental surgery in south london. watch sophie hutchinson 's report in full the surgery sophie hutchinson visited in clapham is brand new , but it only takes private patients .
we found out why from the man who 's just set it up - dr nikhil sisodia .
and , we talked to ian wylie of the british dental association watch our debate on dentists we had a huge number of e-mails - from patients and dentists .
what you told breakfast i was " sacked " by my dentist nearly 18 months ago , when i refused to take out a £ 15 a month insurance policy .
i pointed out that i was on incapacity benefit and the file was closed , i was no longer a patient !
james robertson , cheshire read more viewers ' comments on our your say page a new charging structure , due to come into force next autumn , is intended to put an end to the system of paying for each individual piece of work .
critics say that 's encouraged dentists to " drill and fill " , rather than working on preventative treatments for their patients .
but , according to the national audit office , dentists may end up scaling back their nhs work , because they 're sceptical about the new payment system .
and they 're concerned that the new system will encourage " under treatment " rather than over treatment .
at the moment , only 41 % of adults are registered with a dentist at all .
many people choose to ignore their teeth until they 're in pain - but in some areas , it 's almost impossible to find an nhs dentist .
in an attempt to combat shortages , the government has already increased training places and recruited 1,000 new dentists .
the reforms to nhs dentistry apply in england and wales only .
scotland has its own system .
finding a dentist we 've had a lot of e-mails this morning from people who are having trouble finding a dentist to take them on .
nhs gateway offers an interactive search , by postcode , so that you can find out which dentists are registering nhs patients in your area .

the rise was above market expectations , because of one-off exports of vessels , the ministry of finance said .
close study of the figures showed export activity slowed down due to a downturn in global demand for it products .
export growth has , until recently , been the main engine behind japan 's economic recovery over the past few years .
the recovery has depended to a large extent on a healthy appetite for its goods in china and other asian nations .
in october exports increased 3.2 % to 5.29 trillion yen , while imports rose 2.7 % to 4.43 trillion yen .
a ministry of finance official warned of the downturn in global demand for it products , observing " with regard to the trend of exports of its , we no longer see as a strong growth momentum as we had observed earlier this year " .
officials in tokyo have expressed confidence the country 's export-led recovery would continue , but analysts have been more cautious .
' tougher environment ' tetsuro sawano , fixed income strategist at , mitsubishi securities , said : " the surplus grew , but the rate of increase is clearly far below the high levels we had seen earlier in the year .
" growth in imports is outpacing that in exports , probably the result of higher oil and commodity prices .
" for the overall economy , it 's not just that external demand is no longer a major growth contributor .
" slowing exports mean manufacturers are in a tougher environment , and their contribution to the domestic economy is also waning . "
tighter monetary policy in china could hinder japan 's export performance as beijing battles an overheating economy .

the terrence higgins trust cymru said infection rates in the virus , which can lead to aids , had risen 45 % in the last two years , from 398 in 2001 to 575 in 2003 .
the charity said the rise outstripped the increase in sexual health services .
the welsh assembly government said a review of such services was underway .
the trust 's national director , david lynch , was due to tell an nhs conference in north wales on thursday that a new approach was needed to reverse the trend .
the trust said in its " blueprint for the future " that the increase in hiv infection rates was outstripping the growth in provision of sexual health services . "
there needs to be a commitment to acknowledging sexual health in wales to stop infection rates rocketing further " david lynch , terrence higgins trust cymru it claimed that a " comprehensive and collaborative overhaul of prevention , diagnosis , treatment and care services " was essential to bring infection rates down .
the report , which will be presented at the nhs confederation conference in llandudno , proposes bringing together the work of local health boards , nhs trusts and the welsh assembly , local authorities and community organisations .
the charity wants to create locally and nationally co-ordinated programmes to cut sexually-transmitted infections -lrb- stis -rrb- and hiv , walk-in sti and hiv testing services within communities , and a care network involving gps , hospitals and charities .
it also wants to encourage people to take more responsibility for their sexual health by building awareness and education .
risk groups mr lynch said : " we are seeing massive waiting lists and waiting times to go to a clinic , sometimes two , three , four , five weeks .
" people are n't getting diagnosed at an early stage and are n't getting help at an early stage .

" it has been even less of a priority because of low figures historically but it 's time to change . "
dr olwen williams , a genito-urinary consultant at wrexham maelor hospital , said : " we have seen a rise across all risk groups and people are presenting later in their disease .
" some are coming in with infections who have got an aids diagnosis .
these are people who have n't identified themselves as being at risk .
" they 're people who have never really thought about it and get a surprise when they find out that the pneumonia they 've got is related to hiv - a group we were seeing 20 years ago , " said dr williams .
an assembly government spokesperson said : " there is a review of hiv and sexual health services currently underway .
" recommendations include standards to be set for services and measures to ensure speedy access to hiv and sexually transmitted infection testing services . "
the spokesperson said health minister jane hutt would make a statement before the end of this assembly session , with recommendations going out for consultation early in the new year .

the terrence higgins trust cymru said infection rates in the virus , which can lead to aids , had risen 45 % in the last two years , from 398 in 2001 to 575 in 2003 .
the charity said the rise outstripped the increase in sexual health services .
the welsh assembly government said a review of such services was underway .
the trust 's national director , david lynch , was due to tell an nhs conference in north wales on thursday that a new approach was needed to reverse the trend .
the trust said in its " blueprint for the future " that the increase in hiv infection rates was outstripping the growth in provision of sexual health services .
there needs to be a commitment to acknowledging sexual health in wales to stop infection rates rocketing further david lynch , terrence higgins trust cymru it claimed that a " comprehensive and collaborative overhaul of prevention , diagnosis , treatment and care services " was essential to bring infection rates down .
the report , which will be presented at the nhs confederation conference in llandudno , proposes bringing together the work of local health boards , nhs trusts and the welsh assembly , local authorities and community organisations .
the charity wants to create locally and nationally co-ordinated programmes to cut sexually-transmitted infections -lrb- stis -rrb- and hiv , walk-in sti and hiv testing services within communities , and a care network involving gps , hospitals and charities .
it also wants to encourage people to take more responsibility for their sexual health by building awareness and education .
risk groups mr lynch said : " we are seeing massive waiting lists and waiting times to go to a clinic , sometimes two , three , four , five weeks .
" people are n't getting diagnosed at an early stage and are n't getting help at an early stage .

" it has been even less of a priority because of low figures historically but it 's time to change . "
dr olwen williams , a genito-urinary consultant at wrexham maelor hospital , said : " we have seen a rise across all risk groups and people are presenting later in their disease .
" some are coming in with infections who have got an aids diagnosis .
these are people who have n't identified themselves as being at risk .
" they 're people who have never really thought about it and get a surprise when they find out that the pneumonia they 've got is related to hiv - a group we were seeing 20 years ago , " said dr williams .
an assembly government spokesperson said : " there is a review of hiv and sexual health services currently underway .
" recommendations include standards to be set for services and measures to ensure speedy access to hiv and sexually transmitted infection testing services . "
the spokesperson said health minister jane hutt would make a statement before the end of this assembly session , with recommendations going out for consultation early in the new year .

its troops make up the bulk of the 850 soldiers - who also include signallers , engineers and medical staff - moving to areas outside the iraqi capital baghdad to allow us troops to prepare for anticipated assaults on insurgents .
sadly , on the second day of the regiment 's planned 30-day mission in the region three of its soldiers were killed in a suicide bomb attack whilst manning a checkpoint near falluja .
the regiment is one of the most famous in the british army .
its formation came out of unrest , following the first jacobite rebellion in 1715 .
six companies were formed from 1725 to stop fighting among the clans .
the regiment 's name comes from its role to " watch " the highlands , and the very dark tartan of its uniform .
it is also known as the royal highland regiment .
black watch soldiers have seen action around the world it has fought in numerous conflicts and won distinction in both world wars .
black watch units fought in the napoleonic wars , while in the victorian era they saw combat in the crimea , the west and south of africa and the north west frontier of india .
in world war i they experienced the trenches of the western front , and saw action in france when the germans invaded in may 1940 in world war ii .
black watch units were rescued in the dunkirk evacuations weeks later , and fought in crete , the north african deserts and italy .
they also returned to france after the d-day landings of june 1944 .
the regiment has also carried out peacekeeping duties , in cyprus in 1966 , in northern ireland from the 1970s and in kosovo .
one killed it is one of scotland 's six regiments and its website describes it as " the premier scottish infantry regiment in the british army and one of the most famous fighting forces in the world " .
the black watch first fought in iraq in april 2003 as part of the 7th armoured brigade , which led the desert rats ' attack on basra , the country 's second city .
it began its second mission there in june , involved in aid distribution and the early stages of reconstruction .
the black watch is one of the world 's oldest regiments although it is acting as the reserve battalion in iraq , one soldier has died and another was seriously injured during this second tour of duty .
it was meant to be a six-month mission , but it is not yet known how much longer the troops will stay in the country .
when it does return to the uk , it may face an uncertain future .
the axe is hanging over it once again in the latest round of cuts announced by defence secretary geoff hoon in july .
plans would see one infantry battalion in scotland axed and the remaining five merged into one or two " super-regiments " .
a series of raids on suspected insurgent villages in central iraq in late november was described by one commander as possibly the regiment 's last major operation .
the ministry of defence said consultation was continuing and a decision was not expected before the end of the year .
but supporters of the save the scottish regiments campaign have demonstrated outside the scottish parliament against proposed cuts .

laos ' capital , vientiane , has been beautified in preparation , with women ordered to wear traditional skirts , bars shut down , and traffic restricted .
the us government warned last month that it had information of possible attacks on the asean forum .
laos state-run radio said this week that " bad elements " might plot trouble .
" it is the duty of all laos people to help this meeting go successfully , " vientiane deputy governor boonchan singhawong was quoted as saying by the associated press .
" they have to abide by these -lsb- clean-up -rsb- measures to make the city look good and beautiful , " he said .
asean member countries brunei burma cambodia indonesia laos malaysia philippines singapore thailand vietnam in addition to tightening security , lao authorities hope the meeting will give them a chance to showcase the country 's tourism potential .
the agenda of the meeting - which gathers together foreign ministers from saturday , and leaders from monday - includes a free trade accord between south east asia and china , and an anti-terrorism pact between asean -lrb- association of south east asian nations -rrb- and japan .
momentum is also reportedly building for participants to break with asean 's tradition of non-interference in other 's internal affairs , and press burma to introduce democracy .
burma has recently appointed a new prime minister , who is thought to be even more hardline than his predecessor .
but a senior burmese foreign ministry official , thaung tun , told ap he did not think asean would involve itself in the subject .
" i do n't think the asean would want to discuss internal affairs .
everybody has internal affairs , but you know in every country there are transformations , including burma , " he said .
possibly to stem criticism at the meeting , burma released several political prisoners at the weekend , including former student leader min ko naing .
security is tight for the forum , with manned checkpoints blocking people from entering the capital from the rural and mountainous provinces .
tourists have been told to stay away , after officials said the capital did not have enough hotel rooms .
laos is the victim of sporadic bomb attacks , which the authorities usually blame on " bad elements " .
this is often a reference to the ethnic hmong people , who fought alongside the us during the vietnam war , and claim to have suffered discrimination from the lao authorities ever since .
asean , which groups 10 asian countries , is meeting in the lao capital from 25 to 30 november .

proceedings against sir mark thatcher over allegations he helped finance a coup plot in equatorial guinea have been postponed until 8 april .
the son of former prime minister margaret thatcher had been expected to enter a plea in a south african court , but prosecutors wanted more time .
on wednesday , the high court there ruled he must also face questions from equatorial guinea investigators .
sir mark , 51 , says he was feeling like " a corpse " while proceedings go on .
the businessman - who appeared in court for the two-minute hearing - had his bail conditions extended , meaning he is confined to the cape town area for at least the next five months charges denied sir mark , the son of former prime minister margaret thatcher , has denied being involved in a plan to topple the government of equatorial guinea but is barred from leaving south africa while investigations continue .
sir mark denies the charges .
he was arrested in august at his home in south africa and released after a bail payment of £ 167,000 -lrb- $ 314,000 -rrb- was made .
the businessman had sought to avoid questioning by investigators from equatorial guinea , saying the questions would infringe on his right to silence and would impact on his trial in south africa as well as equatorial guinea should he later be extradited .
on wednesday , judge deon van zyl rejected this argument , saying south african justice minister brigitte mabandla was within her rights to seek sir mark 's responses to the equatorial guinea questions .
extradition plan " she was perfectly entitled to accept the existing scenario as an issue of foreign policy and co-operative relations between south africa and equatorial guinea , " judge van zyl said , adding that sir mark 's rights would not be compromised .
" at no stage have such rights been violated or even threatened , " he said .
thank god my father is not alive to see this sir mark thatcher sir mark 's legal team are still deciding whether to appeal against the ruling .
equatorial guinea , africa 's third biggest oil producer , says it intends to extradite him to face similar charges as 14 other suspected foreign mercenaries currently on trial there .
in an interview with vanity fair magazine , sir mark said he felt like " a corpse " and that he was glad his father was not alive to see his arrest .
sir mark told the magazine : " i will never be able to do business again .
who will deal with me ? "
he said there were 18,500 references to the case on the day he was arrested in august this year .
" thank god my father is not alive to see this , " he said in the january edition of the magazine , on sale from 3 december .
he was " furious " that he was confined to south africa , and that his telephone calls and emails are monitored by the authorities there .

suffolk-based premier foods said it anticipated customer " short-term demand " could be significant .
but the firm said it was confident it could meet holiday demand as production was due to resume at bury st edmunds .
" people wo n't have to go out and desperately buy branston for christmas , " a spokeswoman said .
she said a run on the brand could result in current stocks - enough to cover about two weeks of sales - being sold much quicker than normal .
the company said it expected to restart some production within days and would move gradually to full production of all its products during december and january .
it was also in talks with other manufacturers about covering production of certain products until the plant in suffolk was fully up and running .
the factory also makes hayward 's pickles , loyd grossman sauces and the waistline range .
the fire on 27 october has been blamed on halogen lights which ignited the plastic packaging on bottles .
premier said it had insurance in place to cover material damage and the loss of profits , subject to an excess of £ 1m .

radio spectrum plays a vital role in broadcast media and telecommunications , as well as being essential to emergency services and air traffic control .
regulator ofcom is now planning to loosen control of the spectrum , allowing it to be traded on the open market for the first time in 100 years .
it hopes this approach will lead to greater efficiency and more innovative uses of radio frequencies .
trading spaces " we are turning 100 years of regulation on its head , " said an ofcom spokesman .
" in the past we have had a command and control approach in which we hold the keys and dole them out to people we think deserve it most , " he explained .
" the new approach is that we are not going to say who should use it or tell them how to use it , " he said .
the new approach will allow companies to trade licences to use different parts of the spectrum among themselves as well as developing new services for existing spectrum they own .
it could lead to greater broadband wireless internet access in remote areas of the uk and faster speed wireless links in towns and cities .
but the system will not be a free-for-all .
ofcom will initially look at changes on a case by case basis and will require a type of planning permission of the airwaves to make sure issues such as frequency interference are not a problem .
currently about a third of the radio spectrum is owned by the military .
of the rest , ofcom plans to open up three-quarters of it by 2010 .
some of the spectrum , about 20 % , will remain under close ofcom control because the sectors it supports are so important .
ofcom is also planning to increase slightly the amount of the radio spectrum that is completely unlicensed .
3g difficulties in the past government control of spectrum has been criticised as inefficient .
the auction of spectrum for third generation mobile services saw operators paying billions to get their hands on licenses - an investment that they are now struggling to make profitable .
ofcom says it is more than aware of the problems 3g has created for mobile operators .
" we are very mindful of their situation and that they have invested a huge amount of money in 3g , " said an ofcom spokesman .
" we are talking to them on a regular basis and future proposals will take into account a number of issues affecting a variety of stakeholders , " he added .
ofcom is due to publish a consultation document on the issues surrounding 3g and wireless broadband in december .
