france 's highest court rejected the request for a retrial by the country ’ s most famous nazi collaborator on friday : ninety-three year old maurice papon will not get a chance to fight his conviction for war crimes . the unexpectedly quick ruling by france 's highest court came after just a few hours .
the court de cassation , which examined whether proper legal procedure was followed ahead of papon ‘ s conviction in 1998 for complicity in crimes against humanity and organizing the deportation of jews to nazi death camps , ruled that the country 's most senior official from the pro-nazi vichy regime did not deserve a retrial .
the court was not asked to judge papon 's guilt or innocence , but whether there were legal grounds for awarding the collaborator a retrial as requested .
it said there was no reason to oblige papon and rejected his final attempt at appeal .
lawyers for papon , who was not present during the court 's deliberation , said they will ask the court 's review panel to overturn friday 's decision .
papon , who rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii to become chief of the paris police and later federal budget minister , has been trying to clear his name ever since a court in the southwestern city of bordeaux found him guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity in 1998 .
papon , whose involvement in organizing the deportation came to light in the early 1980s after documents were discovered , claims he did not know of the fate of the jews he deported and that he had only been following orders given to him by the vichy government , which sided with the nazis for most of world war ii .
he argued that he could n't be held partially responsible for the ghastly crimes committed in the nazi death camps , because he was removed by several " links in the chain . "
quest for a retrial after serving only three years of the 10-year sentence , papon was released for reasons of poor health .
he then left france for switzerland and requested a retrial of his case saying he could not be held accountable for crimes against humanity because he was indirectly involved .
the appeals court promptly rejected papon 's request because he was not in france at the time .
however , the european court of human rights has since ruled that the french law requiring appellants to turn themselves over to police custody on the eve of their hearing violates eu law on fair trials .
this opened the way to friday 's review .
the court 's review of the appeal touched on a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the papon case as an example of the extent of nazi sympathy in france during the war .
members of the association of sons and daughters of deported jews of france protested in front of the justice palace to demonstrate their anger with a legal system that could give someone like papon a second chance to fight his conviction .
during world war ii some 76,000 jews , including 12,000 children , were deported from france , many to the death camps in auschwitz .
only 2,500 of them survived . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

the alleged mastermind behind the march 11 train bombings in madrid had connections to germany , investigators said after " mohammed the egyptian " was arrested in italy earlier this week . rabei osman ahmed , known as " mohammed the egyptian , " was known to german intelligence services before he allegedly staged the madrid bombings which killed 191 people .
the 32-year old suspect , who is being held in italy on charges of international terrorism , lived in germany for two years , federal prosecutors said on saturday .
ahmed " was in germany from 1999 until august 2001 , " said frauke scheuten , a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutors .
but , she told reporters , " there is no indication that he planned attacks or was involved in attacks from germany . "
the prosecutors office did not elaborate on details of how and exactly when ahmed arrived in the country , but the weekly news magazine focus said in its edition for monday that the egypt-born suspect entered germany illegally in april 1999 and stayed until authorities lost trace of him in august 2001 .
der spiegel magazine , also in this week 's edition , said ahmed had been arrested two months after entering germany without identification papers on a train bound for france .
he told investigators he was palestinian and requested political asylum .
focus said his application was denied and ahmed was kept in detention in saarbrücken , on the border to france , pending deportation , but officials were unable to establish his nationality .
both magazines said the man was released into a home for asylum seekers in the western town of lebach in september 2000 .
there he set up a prayer room and attracted attention for preaching hatred against jews and israel .
the reports said german police tried to track ahmed down after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks in the united states , but he had already left lebach a month earlier .
on sept .
19 , the asylum alerted state authorities that ahmed had n't been seen since aug .

from that point on , all trace of him was lost .
spanish authorities had eye on ahmed in early 2003 , intelligence services in the state of saarland , of which saarbrücken is the capital , told federal prosecutors they had been informed by spain that ahmed was under investigation on suspicion of supporting a terrorist organization , said focus .
the german federal prosecutor 's office , which handles terrorism cases , ordered criminal police in the saarland region to keep ahmed under watch and to monitor telephone calls in his apartment in lebach .
scheuten confirmed that federal prosecutors had been informed , but refused to give details .
" there were no clues that would have prompted us to open an investigation , " she said , stressing that investigators had no indications then of any attacks being planned .
european-wide investigation the march 11 railway bombings in madrid were blamed on islamic militants with possible links to al qaida .
spain wants to extradite ahmed , and has said the formal request should arrive in rome on monday .
the magistrate in charge of the case said ahmed was a member of the egyptian islamic jihad , a terrorist organization linked to osama bin laden 's al qaida .
fourteen people have so far been arrested and held in custody in connection with the bombings .
seven other suspects blew themselves up april 3 as police closed in on a supposed safe house in the madrid suburb of leganes .
authorities are still looking for or demanding the extradition of eight other suspects , including ahmed .
german prosecutors opened up their own investigation of ahmed this week on the basis of information provided by the italian authorities .
scheuten , who confirmed that fact , said " there are still no indications that the madrid attacks were planned from germany .

on june 12 anne frank would have turned 75 . if her father had not published her diary after world war ii , anne frank would have simply been one among six million jews killed by the nazis .
but the publication of the now famous diary of anne frank lifted the young girl from the anonymous mass of victims and turned her into the face of the holocaust . first published in 1947 , the book has sold more than 25 million copies and has been translated into more than 50 languages .
in 1959 her story was turned into a three-time oscar winning film . anne 's account of the war years is now the subject of a japanese animation film as well as several plays and her diary is required reading in schools around the world .
the hiding place of the frank family , the present-day anne frank huis in amsterdam , is also the most-visited holocaust museum worldwide .
last year the museum registered a new visitor record with over 900,000 people . to coincide with anne 's 75th birthday on june 12 , the anne frank center in germany has released hitherto unpublished photographs from the frank family album shot by anne 's father otto frank . bildunterschrift : anne frank -lrb- left -rrb- stands with her sister margot on the beach in the netherlands in july 1938 . putting a face on the death of millions anne frank 's diary offers readers a glimpse into the mind and emotions of a young girl , shortly before she was packed off to a concentration camp . between 1942 and 1944 , anne confided her personal thoughts and problems to the orange-and-grey checked book , which she received as a gift on her 13th birthday .
the diary is a document of the desperate attempts at survival by a jewish family during nazi persecution . " it 's an individual fate that gave this horrible number of murdered people a face .
that has made anne frank a symbol , " says thomas heppener from the anne frank museum in amsterdam . in 1933 after hitler came to power , the franks fled to amsterdam where otto frank set up a company , which sold pectin used to make jelly and jams .

what is known is that the ss , the elite nazi paramilitary corps stormed the hide-out and brought the franks to a labor camp in the netherlands .
some time later they were transported in cattle cars to auschwitz and later to bergen-belsen , germany . in march 1945 , just weeks before liberation , anne and her sister died of typhoid .
from the eight people who hid in the frank annex in amsterdam , only anne 's father survived the holocaust . controversy over diary 's authenticity though otto frank 's publication of anne 's diary in 1947 sparked much interest , it was n't long before skeptics raised their doubts over the authenticity of the document .
it took a few years before an authentic version was published . " before then passages that were anti-german had been cut out , " said nicolas berg from the leipzig-based simon dunow institute for german-jewish history .
according to berg , the passages were considered too provocative for post-war german readers . finally in 1981 , the dutch state issued an authentication certificate that laid all doubts to rest . comprehending the holocaust more than 50 years later , anne frank 's diary has n't lost its significance .
heppener said the diary " is also a document of a young girl 's adolescent problems . "
anne , who describes her discomfort over her maturing body and uncertainty about her first love , gives voice to emotions shared around the world .
" especially young women can identify strongly with her story because it throws up questions that are relevant even for teenagers today . " heppener believes that the identification with anne frank helps young people gain an introduction to the holocaust .

it took a few years before an authentic version was published . " before then passages that were anti-german had been cut out , " said nicolas berg from the leipzig-based simon dunow institute for german-jewish history .
according to berg , the passages were considered too provocative for post-war german readers . finally in 1981 , the dutch state issued an authentication certificate that laid all doubts to rest . comprehending the holocaust more than 50 years later , anne frank 's diary has n't lost its significance .
heppener said the diary " is also a document of a young girl 's adolescent problems . "
anne , who describes her discomfort over her maturing body and uncertainty about her first love , gives voice to emotions shared around the world .
" especially young women can identify strongly with her story because it throws up questions that are relevant even for teenagers today . " heppener believes that the identification with anne frank helps young people gain an introduction to the holocaust .

a settlement would remove one of the remaining hurdles barring tripoli from joining the eu 's trade partnership with mediterranean countries and set another step on the path towards ending the pariah status of the oil-rich country .
two american soldiers and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 other people wounded in the explosion at the disco , a popular nightspot for u.s. soldiers .
german lawyers and members of libyan leader muammar gaddafi 's charitable foundation have been negotiating a deal covering the over 160 non-american victims of the attack and the relatives of the turkish woman .
the lawyer negotiating for the victims said the talks were conducted in an " open and constructive atmosphere , " and that the two sides had moved closer .
although negotiators have yet to settle on a final sum , the compensation figure could reach about $ 40 million .
a german court ruled in 2001 the libyan secret service was behind the bombing and convicted four people , including a former libyan diplomat . dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .
the talks will continue in june .

she died at age 15 in a concentration camp , but her diary survived to tell the story that has shaped the world 's image of the holocaust .
on june 12 anne frank would have turned 75 . if her father had not published her diary after world war ii , anne frank would have simply been one among six million jews killed by the nazis .
but the publication of the now famous diary of anne frank lifted the young girl from the anonymous mass of victims and turned her into the face of the holocaust . first published in 1947 , the book has sold more than 25 million copies and has been translated into more than 50 languages .
in 1959 her story was turned into a three-time oscar winning film . anne 's account of the war years is now the subject of a japanese animation film as well as several plays and her diary is required reading in schools around the world .
the hiding place of the frank family , the present-day anne frank huis in amsterdam , is also the most-visited holocaust museum worldwide .
last year the museum registered a new visitor record with over 900,000 people . to coincide with anne 's 75th birthday on june 12 , the anne frank center in germany has released hitherto unpublished photographs from the frank family album shot by anne 's father otto frank . bildunterschrift : anne frank -lrb- left -rrb- stands with her sister margot on the beach in the netherlands in july 1938 . putting a face on the death of millions anne frank 's diary offers readers a glimpse into the mind and emotions of a young girl , shortly before she was packed off to a concentration camp . between 1942 and 1944 , anne confided her personal thoughts and problems to the orange-and-grey checked book , which she received as a gift on her 13th birthday .
the diary is a document of the desperate attempts at survival by a jewish family during nazi persecution . " it 's an individual fate that gave this horrible number of murdered people a face .
that has made anne frank a symbol , " says thomas heppener from the anne frank museum in amsterdam . in 1933 after hitler came to power , the franks fled to amsterdam where otto frank set up a company , which sold pectin used to make jelly and jams .
the family led a normal life until the tranquility ended abruptly in 1940 when germany occupied the netherlands and began implementing anti-jewish measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the family hid themselves in a couple of empty back rooms in otto frank 's office building .
while work continued as usual in the front room and storehouses , the franks lived quietly in the back together with another family .
a staircase connected the two buildings , the opening to which was camouflaged with a hinged bookcase which served as a door .
the families depended on several of ottofrank 's loyal employees to bring them food and keep their secret . anne and kitty it was during this time that the diary became anne 's best friend .
she named it kitty .
anne penned her thoughts and wishes in the diary and described the tensions and quarrels that erupted from a covert life in cramped quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an undated file photo of anne frank .
she also detailed nights filled with fear as bombs rained down on amsterdam or when strangers came to the office during the day and the franks had to stay absolutely still for hours in their hide-out . in august 1944 however the franks were betrayed .
it still remains unclear by whom .
what is known is that the ss , the elite nazi paramilitary corps stormed the hide-out and brought the franks to a labor camp in the netherlands .
some time later they were transported in cattle cars to auschwitz and later to bergen-belsen , germany . in march 1945 , just weeks before liberation , anne and her sister died of typhoid .
from the eight people who hid in the frank annex in amsterdam , only anne 's father survived the holocaust . controversy over diary 's authenticity though otto frank 's publication of anne 's diary in 1947 sparked much interest , it was n't long before skeptics raised their doubts over the authenticity of the document .
it took a few years before an authentic version was published . " before then passages that were anti-german had been cut out , " said nicolas berg from the leipzig-based simon dunow institute for german-jewish history .
according to berg , the passages were considered too provocative for post-war german readers . finally in 1981 , the dutch state issued an authentication certificate that laid all doubts to rest . comprehending the holocaust more than 50 years later , anne frank 's diary has n't lost its significance .
heppener said the diary " is also a document of a young girl 's adolescent problems . "
anne , who describes her discomfort over her maturing body and uncertainty about her first love , gives voice to emotions shared around the world .
" especially young women can identify strongly with her story because it throws up questions that are relevant even for teenagers today . " heppener believes that the identification with anne frank helps young people gain an introduction to the holocaust .

france 's highest court rejected the request for a retrial by the country ’ s most famous nazi collaborator on friday : ninety-three year old maurice papon will not get a chance to fight his conviction for war crimes . the unexpectedly quick ruling by france 's highest court came after just a few hours .
the court de cassation , which examined whether proper legal procedure was followed ahead of papon ‘ s conviction in 1998 for complicity in crimes against humanity and organizing the deportation of jews to nazi death camps , ruled that the country 's most senior official from the pro-nazi vichy regime did not deserve a retrial .
the court was not asked to judge papon 's guilt or innocence , but whether there were legal grounds for awarding the collaborator a retrial as requested .
it said there was no reason to oblige papon and rejected his final attempt at appeal .
lawyers for papon , who was not present during the court 's deliberation , said they will ask the court 's review panel to overturn friday 's decision .
papon , who rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii to become chief of the paris police and later federal budget minister , has been trying to clear his name ever since a court in the southwestern city of bordeaux found him guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity in 1998 .
papon , whose involvement in organizing the deportation came to light in the early 1980s after documents were discovered , claims he did not know of the fate of the jews he deported and that he had only been following orders given to him by the vichy government , which sided with the nazis for most of world war ii .
he argued that he could n't be held partially responsible for the ghastly crimes committed in the nazi death camps , because he was removed by several " links in the chain . "
quest for a retrial after serving only three years of the 10-year sentence , papon was released for reasons of poor health .
he then left france for switzerland and requested a retrial of his case saying he could not be held accountable for crimes against humanity because he was indirectly involved .
the appeals court promptly rejected papon 's request because he was not in france at the time .
however , the european court of human rights has since ruled that the french law requiring appellants to turn themselves over to police custody on the eve of their hearing violates eu law on fair trials .
this opened the way to friday 's review .
the court 's review of the appeal touched on a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the papon case as an example of the extent of nazi sympathy in france during the war .
members of the association of sons and daughters of deported jews of france protested in front of the justice palace to demonstrate their anger with a legal system that could give someone like papon a second chance to fight his conviction .
during world war ii some 76,000 jews , including 12,000 children , were deported from france , many to the death camps in auschwitz .
only 2,500 of them survived . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

their husbands may make a living from playing a game but for the wives of international soccer stars , life is more serious than that .
there are boutiques to visit , column inches to fill and their own careers to pursue . there is a popular saying that claims that behind every successful man stands a strong woman .
in the world of soccer , where the adulation of millions of fans and the temptations that come with untold riches can lead even the most resolute man astray , the women behind the stars have to be even stronger than those in less intense environments .
it helps when the woman in question has as high a profile as the man she supposedly stands behind .
and when it comes to high profile , one can not get any more high profile than the wife of the man who is undoubtedly the most famous soccer player of his generation .
victoria beckham was already famous in her own right when she snagged the attentions of husband-to-be david , the then fast rising star of the manchester united team .
as one fifth of british pop group the spice girls , posh had a number of hit records before young master beckham slipped a rock the size of gibraltar on her finger and popped the question in 1998 .
apparently showing much-hidden depths , vicky saw the potential and within five years , she 'd ditched the pop career in all but name and had gone full time as mrs. beckham .
it has proved to be a brilliant career move for everyone involved .
posh is more than meets the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victoria stands by her man .
victoria has also proved she 's more than the strangely pouting woman dangling from the arm of the world 's most famous footballer .
recent allegations of infidelity on his part resulted in a good slap from posh followed by a promise to stand by her man , showing mrs. becks to be a fair and forgiving wife who values her family life .
there 's a woman who knows what she wants and knows how to get it .
another euro 2004 star who can be satisfied that his missus is well occupied while he 's playing away from home will be sweden 's goalkeeper magnus hedman .
the scandinavian goalie is one half of his country 's " blonde and beautiful " celebrity partnership , sharing the marital bed with former playboy playmate , model and pop star magdalena graf , who is undoubtedly more famous than the celtic keeper in their native land .
while the blonde magnus will be facing the firepower of europe 's best strikers , beautiful magda , one of sweden 's most recognizable and desired stars , will be pursuing her latest venture - hitting the boutiques .
mags loves her bags mother-of-two mags , regularly voted one of the world 's sexiest footballer 's wives , is renowned for her ability to spend with abandon and allegedly once blew over € 3000 -lrb- $ 3680 -rrb- of hubby magnus ' casino winnings on two handbags .
hedman will be hoping to keep sweden in the tournament for as long as possible , given the amount of win bonuses which will be needed back home .
even if their careers fail to eclipse those of their husbands and partners , many soccer wives and girlfriends overshadow their men in terms of glamour and beauty , often begging the question : " what on earth does she see in him ? "
the supermodel and the goalie take supermodel linda evangelista for example .
a woman who famously said she would n't get out of bed for anything less than $ 10,000 a day , the leggy canadian spurned a number of hollywood suitors and plumped for the french international goalkeeper fabien barthez , a diminutive man of slight build , below average height and bald as a cue ball who looks more like a james bond villain than a professional footballer .
prone to bulging eyes and erratic behavior , one wonders what linda saw in him when she said " yes " at the altar .
the couple had a wild time while barthez was starring for as monaco , enjoying the sophisticated lifestyle of the principality , but began experiencing problems once he moved to less glamorous manchester to pull on the shirt of united . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer team told no sex before games lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.06.2004 french court rejects retrial of nazi collaborator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maurice papon has been fighting to clear his name since convicted in 1998 .
france 's highest court rejected the request for a retrial by the country ’ s most famous nazi collaborator on friday : ninety-three year old maurice papon will not get a chance to fight his conviction for war crimes . the unexpectedly quick ruling by france 's highest court came after just a few hours .
the court de cassation , which examined whether proper legal procedure was followed ahead of papon ‘ s conviction in 1998 for complicity in crimes against humanity and organizing the deportation of jews to nazi death camps , ruled that the country 's most senior official from the pro-nazi vichy regime did not deserve a retrial .
the court was not asked to judge papon 's guilt or innocence , but whether there were legal grounds for awarding the collaborator a retrial as requested .
it said there was no reason to oblige papon and rejected his final attempt at appeal .
lawyers for papon , who was not present during the court 's deliberation , said they will ask the court 's review panel to overturn friday 's decision .
papon , who rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii to become chief of the paris police and later federal budget minister , has been trying to clear his name ever since a court in the southwestern city of bordeaux found him guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity in 1998 .
papon , whose involvement in organizing the deportation came to light in the early 1980s after documents were discovered , claims he did not know of the fate of the jews he deported and that he had only been following orders given to him by the vichy government , which sided with the nazis for most of world war ii .
he argued that he could n't be held partially responsible for the ghastly crimes committed in the nazi death camps , because he was removed by several " links in the chain . "
quest for a retrial after serving only three years of the 10-year sentence , papon was released for reasons of poor health .
he then left france for switzerland and requested a retrial of his case saying he could not be held accountable for crimes against humanity because he was indirectly involved .
the appeals court promptly rejected papon 's request because he was not in france at the time .
however , the european court of human rights has since ruled that the french law requiring appellants to turn themselves over to police custody on the eve of their hearing violates eu law on fair trials .
this opened the way to friday 's review .
the court 's review of the appeal touched on a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the papon case as an example of the extent of nazi sympathy in france during the war .
members of the association of sons and daughters of deported jews of france protested in front of the justice palace to demonstrate their anger with a legal system that could give someone like papon a second chance to fight his conviction .
during world war ii some 76,000 jews , including 12,000 children , were deported from france , many to the death camps in auschwitz .
only 2,500 of them survived . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

their husbands may make a living from playing a game but for the wives of international soccer stars , life is more serious than that .
there are boutiques to visit , column inches to fill and their own careers to pursue . there is a popular saying that claims that behind every successful man stands a strong woman .
in the world of soccer , where the adulation of millions of fans and the temptations that come with untold riches can lead even the most resolute man astray , the women behind the stars have to be even stronger than those in less intense environments .
it helps when the woman in question has as high a profile as the man she supposedly stands behind .
and when it comes to high profile , one can not get any more high profile than the wife of the man who is undoubtedly the most famous soccer player of his generation .
victoria beckham was already famous in her own right when she snagged the attentions of husband-to-be david , the then fast rising star of the manchester united team .
as one fifth of british pop group the spice girls , posh had a number of hit records before young master beckham slipped a rock the size of gibraltar on her finger and popped the question in 1998 .

recent allegations of infidelity on his part resulted in a good slap from posh followed by a promise to stand by her man , showing mrs. becks to be a fair and forgiving wife who values her family life .
there 's a woman who knows what she wants and knows how to get it .
another euro 2004 star who can be satisfied that his missus is well occupied while he 's playing away from home will be sweden 's goalkeeper magnus hedman .
the scandinavian goalie is one half of his country 's " blonde and beautiful " celebrity partnership , sharing the marital bed with former playboy playmate , model and pop star magdalena graf , who is undoubtedly more famous than the celtic keeper in their native land .

she died at age 15 in a concentration camp , but her diary survived to tell the story that has shaped the world 's image of the holocaust .
on june 12 anne frank would have turned 75 . if her father had not published her diary after world war ii , anne frank would have simply been one among six million jews killed by the nazis .
but the publication of the now famous diary of anne frank lifted the young girl from the anonymous mass of victims and turned her into the face of the holocaust . first published in 1947 , the book has sold more than 25 million copies and has been translated into more than 50 languages .
in 1959 her story was turned into a three-time oscar winning film . anne 's account of the war years is now the subject of a japanese animation film as well as several plays and her diary is required reading in schools around the world .
the hiding place of the frank family , the present-day anne frank huis in amsterdam , is also the most-visited holocaust museum worldwide .
last year the museum registered a new visitor record with over 900,000 people . to coincide with anne 's 75th birthday on june 12 , the anne frank center in germany has released hitherto unpublished photographs from the frank family album shot by anne 's father otto frank . bildunterschrift : anne frank -lrb- left -rrb- stands with her sister margot on the beach in the netherlands in july 1938 . putting a face on the death of millions anne frank 's diary offers readers a glimpse into the mind and emotions of a young girl , shortly before she was packed off to a concentration camp . between 1942 and 1944 , anne confided her personal thoughts and problems to the orange-and-grey checked book , which she received as a gift on her 13th birthday .
the diary is a document of the desperate attempts at survival by a jewish family during nazi persecution . " it 's an individual fate that gave this horrible number of murdered people a face .
that has made anne frank a symbol , " says thomas heppener from the anne frank museum in amsterdam . in 1933 after hitler came to power , the franks fled to amsterdam where otto frank set up a company , which sold pectin used to make jelly and jams .
the family led a normal life until the tranquility ended abruptly in 1940 when germany occupied the netherlands and began implementing anti-jewish measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the family hid themselves in a couple of empty back rooms in otto frank 's office building .
while work continued as usual in the front room and storehouses , the franks lived quietly in the back together with another family .
a staircase connected the two buildings , the opening to which was camouflaged with a hinged bookcase which served as a door .
the families depended on several of ottofrank 's loyal employees to bring them food and keep their secret . anne and kitty it was during this time that the diary became anne 's best friend .
she named it kitty .
anne penned her thoughts and wishes in the diary and described the tensions and quarrels that erupted from a covert life in cramped quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an undated file photo of anne frank .
she also detailed nights filled with fear as bombs rained down on amsterdam or when strangers came to the office during the day and the franks had to stay absolutely still for hours in their hide-out . in august 1944 however the franks were betrayed .
it still remains unclear by whom .
what is known is that the ss , the elite nazi paramilitary corps stormed the hide-out and brought the franks to a labor camp in the netherlands .
some time later they were transported in cattle cars to auschwitz and later to bergen-belsen , germany . in march 1945 , just weeks before liberation , anne and her sister died of typhoid .
from the eight people who hid in the frank annex in amsterdam , only anne 's father survived the holocaust . controversy over diary 's authenticity though otto frank 's publication of anne 's diary in 1947 sparked much interest , it was n't long before skeptics raised their doubts over the authenticity of the document .
it took a few years before an authentic version was published . " before then passages that were anti-german had been cut out , " said nicolas berg from the leipzig-based simon dunow institute for german-jewish history .
according to berg , the passages were considered too provocative for post-war german readers . finally in 1981 , the dutch state issued an authentication certificate that laid all doubts to rest . comprehending the holocaust more than 50 years later , anne frank 's diary has n't lost its significance .
heppener said the diary " is also a document of a young girl 's adolescent problems . "
anne , who describes her discomfort over her maturing body and uncertainty about her first love , gives voice to emotions shared around the world .
" especially young women can identify strongly with her story because it throws up questions that are relevant even for teenagers today . " heppener believes that the identification with anne frank helps young people gain an introduction to the holocaust .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.06.2004 german link to madrid bombing suspect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the madrid bombings was one of europe 's worst terror attacks .
the alleged mastermind behind the march 11 train bombings in madrid had connections to germany , investigators said after " mohammed the egyptian " was arrested in italy earlier this week . rabei osman ahmed , known as " mohammed the egyptian , " was known to german intelligence services before he allegedly staged the madrid bombings which killed 191 people .
the 32-year old suspect , who is being held in italy on charges of international terrorism , lived in germany for two years , federal prosecutors said on saturday .
ahmed " was in germany from 1999 until august 2001 , " said frauke scheuten , a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutors .
but , she told reporters , " there is no indication that he planned attacks or was involved in attacks from germany . "
the prosecutors office did not elaborate on details of how and exactly when ahmed arrived in the country , but the weekly news magazine focus said in its edition for monday that the egypt-born suspect entered germany illegally in april 1999 and stayed until authorities lost trace of him in august 2001 .
der spiegel magazine , also in this week 's edition , said ahmed had been arrested two months after entering germany without identification papers on a train bound for france .
he told investigators he was palestinian and requested political asylum .
focus said his application was denied and ahmed was kept in detention in saarbrücken , on the border to france , pending deportation , but officials were unable to establish his nationality .
both magazines said the man was released into a home for asylum seekers in the western town of lebach in september 2000 .
there he set up a prayer room and attracted attention for preaching hatred against jews and israel .
the reports said german police tried to track ahmed down after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks in the united states , but he had already left lebach a month earlier .
on sept .
19 , the asylum alerted state authorities that ahmed had n't been seen since aug .
29 .
from that point on , all trace of him was lost .
spanish authorities had eye on ahmed in early 2003 , intelligence services in the state of saarland , of which saarbrücken is the capital , told federal prosecutors they had been informed by spain that ahmed was under investigation on suspicion of supporting a terrorist organization , said focus .
the german federal prosecutor 's office , which handles terrorism cases , ordered criminal police in the saarland region to keep ahmed under watch and to monitor telephone calls in his apartment in lebach .
scheuten confirmed that federal prosecutors had been informed , but refused to give details .
" there were no clues that would have prompted us to open an investigation , " she said , stressing that investigators had no indications then of any attacks being planned .
european-wide investigation the march 11 railway bombings in madrid were blamed on islamic militants with possible links to al qaida .
spain wants to extradite ahmed , and has said the formal request should arrive in rome on monday .
the magistrate in charge of the case said ahmed was a member of the egyptian islamic jihad , a terrorist organization linked to osama bin laden 's al qaida .
fourteen people have so far been arrested and held in custody in connection with the bombings .
seven other suspects blew themselves up april 3 as police closed in on a supposed safe house in the madrid suburb of leganes .
authorities are still looking for or demanding the extradition of eight other suspects , including ahmed .
german prosecutors opened up their own investigation of ahmed this week on the basis of information provided by the italian authorities .
scheuten , who confirmed that fact , said " there are still no indications that the madrid attacks were planned from germany .
she also added that at the moment " no connection with the sept .
11 attacks is discernible . "
germany became a focus of terror investigations after the sept .

now no longer together despite the frenchman being back on home soil in marseille , barthez extended his lucky streak post-linda by allegedly dated another model-slash-actress , the french starlet ophelie winter .
ms. winter , the daughter of a famous dutch singer , has a string of french tv credits to her name and has appeared in a number of movies .
she has also displayed her father 's talent for music by turning her career path towards the charts with the release of two solo albums .
despite the romantic rumors , reports on the current status of the alleged fling are sketchy .
however , regardless of whether these two are still in l 'amour , barthez will be in good company at euro 2004 .
fab is n't the only one who can count their lucky stars when it comes to bagging a gorgeous partner while looking like a plumber .
portugal 's luis figo also enjoys a " beauty and the beast " relationship with his swedish wife helene .
luis figo 's swedish saint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mr. posh takes boutique advice from helene figo 's husband .
obviously a woman with a high tolerance to sweat , helene figo is the scandinavian rock on which the perspiration of toiling portugal playmaker luis drips onto when he gets home .
the famously moist real madrid midfielder should give thanks every day for his steadfast wife who endured death threats and abuse after her husband committed the heinous crime of leaving fc barcelona for the galacticos .
helene , who models for the elite agency under her maiden name svedin , has shown more than enough backbone for both of them , standing firm in the pressure cooker atmosphere of spanish football while raising two children and continuing her own career .
casanova kahn left empty-handed one high-profile player who will be pining for love during this tournament will be german captain oliver kahn .
the bayern munich goalkeeper currently finds his plate empty after having his cake and eating it over recent months .
oli infamously deserted his wife simone while she was eight months pregnant for the ample charms of brew house temptress 21-year-old verena kerth in march 2003 .
the saga that followed oli 's flight from one blonde and the shacking up with another filled the pages of the popular german press for months as he dallied over his decision ; one moment appearing to be wracked with remorse and wanting simone back , the next boozing it up with verena at discos across bavaria .
party chicken moves onto pastures new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after over a year of romance , kahn has distanced himself from his " party chicken . "
it looked like love .
verena , the girl the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper called " the pierced party chicken , " soon made concessions to her new man , ditching her barely-there mini skirts and strappy tops for more somber attire at his behest .
but despite her efforts , oli called it a day in may this year , stating that there was no room for relationships in his career .
seemingly unaffected , expect verena to dig out those revealing outfits again as she begins her television career with mtv on the back of her high profile fling with kahn .
who 's the winner there ?
meanwhile , jilted wife simone has maintained her dignity by filing for divorce , spurning calls for reconciliation and sporting t-shirts with slogans such as " like a thief in the night , i 'm gonna get what 's mine . "

how will germans live in 2020 ?
more self-sufficiently as they learn to wean themselves off the generous social welfare system , according to researchers looking into the future . first the good news : germans , especially the younger generation , are increasingly fending for themselves and realizing the need to perform and excel instead of depending on dwindling state hand-outs and perks . they will account for around 40 percent of the population by 2010 and almost 50 by 2020 . on the flip side , germans will become increasingly plagued by worries of an insecure future in the face of rising unemployment and shrinking social benefits . that was the general conclusion of a study titled " germany 2020 .
how we 'll live tomorrow " presented in berlin this week by well-known german future trends researcher horst w. opaschowski and his colleagues at the b.a.t. leisure research institute in hamburg . " the days of plenty , of ease and luxurious living are over , " said opaschowski . no more state hand-outs the results are not likely to come as a surprise for the majority of germans . for some years now , the country 's generous welfare system , the envy of many western countries , is slowly beginning to lose its luster .
with an ageing population , declining birth rate , sluggish economy and rising unemployment , the once robust social system is crumbling . recent reforms initiated by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats and the junior coalition partner the greens - largely unpopular measures designed to reduce non-wage related costs and streamline the country 's benefits system - have meant a slash in unemployment benefits , additional health care costs and a reduction in pensions . continuing high unemployment but the latest study is still expected to provide some important pointers on how disengagement from a state-backed social security system is likely to affect germans in the coming years . opaschowski is certain germans will fret the most about unemployment in the next 10 to 20 years .
the country currently has an jobless rate of about 10.3 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is uncertain for a majority of germans .
the study , which is based on scientific research as well as a survey of 2,000 germans above the age of 14 , shows that among those questioned , 63 percent are concerned about affording health care , 59 percent worry about criminality and 57 about pensions . the future trend researchers give poor marks to germany 's political parties , who they say have n't managed to present the citizens with a concrete plan for the future .
all the policy programs until now have been just mere patchwork , according to the experts . " the future does n't have to be the big vision for the next 30 years .
rather the citizens actually want a step-by-step plan : we 're here in 2004 and this is happening , but in 2006 this is how it will be , " opaschowski said .
" but this kind of planning is n't happening in politics .
we hear everyday of what 's working , but we want to hear where it 's going . " self-help and individual performance despite the gloomy news , opaschowski is quick to point out that there 's light at the end of the tunnel and stresses that germans are realizing they ca n't wait for the state to spoon-feed them anymore . " they -lrb- the germans -rrb- have the impression that those at the top decision-making levels are n't managing alone .
they 're realizing they must take matters into their own hands and that the future will in no way be better than the present , " opaschowski said . according to the researchers the sobering realization is spurring germans to focus more on better performance and qualifications as well as fundamentally changing their perception of the state as the highest authority . " networks and citizens ' initiatives are gaining new significance .
the people want to achieve more things on their own and lead a more active life , " according to the study .
" help yourself before the state does , " is opaschowski 's verdict . " beacon of hope " the researchers are clear that the trend to help oneself is particularly conspicuous among younger germans .
according to the study , a new generation that increasingly defines itself through performance is on the rise .
even germany 's deputy research minister wolf-michael catenhausen says , " the younger generation is the beacon of hope in the 21st century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.06.2004 french court rejects retrial of nazi collaborator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maurice papon has been fighting to clear his name since convicted in 1998 .
france 's highest court rejected the request for a retrial by the country ’ s most famous nazi collaborator on friday : ninety-three year old maurice papon will not get a chance to fight his conviction for war crimes . the unexpectedly quick ruling by france 's highest court came after just a few hours .
the court de cassation , which examined whether proper legal procedure was followed ahead of papon ‘ s conviction in 1998 for complicity in crimes against humanity and organizing the deportation of jews to nazi death camps , ruled that the country 's most senior official from the pro-nazi vichy regime did not deserve a retrial .
the court was not asked to judge papon 's guilt or innocence , but whether there were legal grounds for awarding the collaborator a retrial as requested .
it said there was no reason to oblige papon and rejected his final attempt at appeal .
lawyers for papon , who was not present during the court 's deliberation , said they will ask the court 's review panel to overturn friday 's decision .
papon , who rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii to become chief of the paris police and later federal budget minister , has been trying to clear his name ever since a court in the southwestern city of bordeaux found him guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity in 1998 .
papon , whose involvement in organizing the deportation came to light in the early 1980s after documents were discovered , claims he did not know of the fate of the jews he deported and that he had only been following orders given to him by the vichy government , which sided with the nazis for most of world war ii .
he argued that he could n't be held partially responsible for the ghastly crimes committed in the nazi death camps , because he was removed by several " links in the chain . "
quest for a retrial after serving only three years of the 10-year sentence , papon was released for reasons of poor health .
he then left france for switzerland and requested a retrial of his case saying he could not be held accountable for crimes against humanity because he was indirectly involved .
the appeals court promptly rejected papon 's request because he was not in france at the time .
however , the european court of human rights has since ruled that the french law requiring appellants to turn themselves over to police custody on the eve of their hearing violates eu law on fair trials .
this opened the way to friday 's review .
the court 's review of the appeal touched on a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the papon case as an example of the extent of nazi sympathy in france during the war .
members of the association of sons and daughters of deported jews of france protested in front of the justice palace to demonstrate their anger with a legal system that could give someone like papon a second chance to fight his conviction .
during world war ii some 76,000 jews , including 12,000 children , were deported from france , many to the death camps in auschwitz .
only 2,500 of them survived . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

she died at age 15 in a concentration camp , but her diary survived to tell the story that has shaped the world 's image of the holocaust .
on june 12 anne frank would have turned 75 . if her father had not published her diary after world war ii , anne frank would have simply been one among six million jews killed by the nazis .
but the publication of the now famous diary of anne frank lifted the young girl from the anonymous mass of victims and turned her into the face of the holocaust . first published in 1947 , the book has sold more than 25 million copies and has been translated into more than 50 languages .
in 1959 her story was turned into a three-time oscar winning film . anne 's account of the war years is now the subject of a japanese animation film as well as several plays and her diary is required reading in schools around the world .
the hiding place of the frank family , the present-day anne frank huis in amsterdam , is also the most-visited holocaust museum worldwide .
last year the museum registered a new visitor record with over 900,000 people . to coincide with anne 's 75th birthday on june 12 , the anne frank center in germany has released hitherto unpublished photographs from the frank family album shot by anne 's father otto frank . bildunterschrift : anne frank -lrb- left -rrb- stands with her sister margot on the beach in the netherlands in july 1938 . putting a face on the death of millions anne frank 's diary offers readers a glimpse into the mind and emotions of a young girl , shortly before she was packed off to a concentration camp . between 1942 and 1944 , anne confided her personal thoughts and problems to the orange-and-grey checked book , which she received as a gift on her 13th birthday .
the diary is a document of the desperate attempts at survival by a jewish family during nazi persecution . " it 's an individual fate that gave this horrible number of murdered people a face .
that has made anne frank a symbol , " says thomas heppener from the anne frank museum in amsterdam . in 1933 after hitler came to power , the franks fled to amsterdam where otto frank set up a company , which sold pectin used to make jelly and jams .
the family led a normal life until the tranquility ended abruptly in 1940 when germany occupied the netherlands and began implementing anti-jewish measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the family hid themselves in a couple of empty back rooms in otto frank 's office building .
while work continued as usual in the front room and storehouses , the franks lived quietly in the back together with another family .
a staircase connected the two buildings , the opening to which was camouflaged with a hinged bookcase which served as a door .
the families depended on several of ottofrank 's loyal employees to bring them food and keep their secret . anne and kitty it was during this time that the diary became anne 's best friend .
she named it kitty .
anne penned her thoughts and wishes in the diary and described the tensions and quarrels that erupted from a covert life in cramped quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an undated file photo of anne frank .
she also detailed nights filled with fear as bombs rained down on amsterdam or when strangers came to the office during the day and the franks had to stay absolutely still for hours in their hide-out . in august 1944 however the franks were betrayed .
it still remains unclear by whom .
what is known is that the ss , the elite nazi paramilitary corps stormed the hide-out and brought the franks to a labor camp in the netherlands .
some time later they were transported in cattle cars to auschwitz and later to bergen-belsen , germany . in march 1945 , just weeks before liberation , anne and her sister died of typhoid .
from the eight people who hid in the frank annex in amsterdam , only anne 's father survived the holocaust . controversy over diary 's authenticity though otto frank 's publication of anne 's diary in 1947 sparked much interest , it was n't long before skeptics raised their doubts over the authenticity of the document .
it took a few years before an authentic version was published . " before then passages that were anti-german had been cut out , " said nicolas berg from the leipzig-based simon dunow institute for german-jewish history .
according to berg , the passages were considered too provocative for post-war german readers . finally in 1981 , the dutch state issued an authentication certificate that laid all doubts to rest . comprehending the holocaust more than 50 years later , anne frank 's diary has n't lost its significance .
heppener said the diary " is also a document of a young girl 's adolescent problems . "
anne , who describes her discomfort over her maturing body and uncertainty about her first love , gives voice to emotions shared around the world .
" especially young women can identify strongly with her story because it throws up questions that are relevant even for teenagers today . " heppener believes that the identification with anne frank helps young people gain an introduction to the holocaust .
a young girl who dies in the face of the nazi death machine allows many to grasp the ghastly reality of the holocaust , he says . silke ballweg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

now no longer together despite the frenchman being back on home soil in marseille , barthez extended his lucky streak post-linda by allegedly dated another model-slash-actress , the french starlet ophelie winter .
ms. winter , the daughter of a famous dutch singer , has a string of french tv credits to her name and has appeared in a number of movies .
she has also displayed her father 's talent for music by turning her career path towards the charts with the release of two solo albums .
despite the romantic rumors , reports on the current status of the alleged fling are sketchy .
however , regardless of whether these two are still in l 'amour , barthez will be in good company at euro 2004 .

obviously a woman with a high tolerance to sweat , helene figo is the scandinavian rock on which the perspiration of toiling portugal playmaker luis drips onto when he gets home .
the famously moist real madrid midfielder should give thanks every day for his steadfast wife who endured death threats and abuse after her husband committed the heinous crime of leaving fc barcelona for the galacticos .
helene , who models for the elite agency under her maiden name svedin , has shown more than enough backbone for both of them , standing firm in the pressure cooker atmosphere of spanish football while raising two children and continuing her own career .

oli infamously deserted his wife simone while she was eight months pregnant for the ample charms of brew house temptress 21-year-old verena kerth in march 2003 .
the saga that followed oli 's flight from one blonde and the shacking up with another filled the pages of the popular german press for months as he dallied over his decision ; one moment appearing to be wracked with remorse and wanting simone back , the next boozing it up with verena at discos across bavaria .
party chicken moves onto pastures new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after over a year of romance , kahn has distanced himself from his " party chicken . "
it looked like love .
verena , the girl the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper called " the pierced party chicken , " soon made concessions to her new man , ditching her barely-there mini skirts and strappy tops for more somber attire at his behest .
but despite her efforts , oli called it a day in may this year , stating that there was no room for relationships in his career .
seemingly unaffected , expect verena to dig out those revealing outfits again as she begins her television career with mtv on the back of her high profile fling with kahn .
who 's the winner there ?
meanwhile , jilted wife simone has maintained her dignity by filing for divorce , spurning calls for reconciliation and sporting t-shirts with slogans such as " like a thief in the night , i 'm gonna get what 's mine . "

" i regard sex a few hours before a game as a problem , " he told the german sports news agency sid . alcohol and cigarettes could also be problematic , he said , but there are no official controls over players ' behavior and it 's up to them to do what 's right - in this case , he said , the right choice would be water , and lots of it . temperatures in portugal are much higher than in germany and players need to keep their bodies hydrated and cool by imbibing plenty of the clear stuff . " drink , drink , drink " is his advice - simple , but not as enjoyable as the erotic alternative . russian strategy while the germans are preaching abstinence , the russians think a little eroticism could propel their players to victory in portugal .

" i regard sex a few hours before a game as a problem , " he told the german sports news agency sid . alcohol and cigarettes could also be problematic , he said , but there are no official controls over players ' behavior and it 's up to them to do what 's right - in this case , he said , the right choice would be water , and lots of it . temperatures in portugal are much higher than in germany and players need to keep their bodies hydrated and cool by imbibing plenty of the clear stuff . " drink , drink , drink " is his advice - simple , but not as enjoyable as the erotic alternative . russian strategy while the germans are preaching abstinence , the russians think a little eroticism could propel their players to victory in portugal .

how will germans live in 2020 ?
more self-sufficiently as they learn to wean themselves off the generous social welfare system , according to researchers looking into the future . first the good news : germans , especially the younger generation , are increasingly fending for themselves and realizing the need to perform and excel instead of depending on dwindling state hand-outs and perks . they will account for around 40 percent of the population by 2010 and almost 50 by 2020 . on the flip side , germans will become increasingly plagued by worries of an insecure future in the face of rising unemployment and shrinking social benefits . that was the general conclusion of a study titled " germany 2020 .
how we 'll live tomorrow " presented in berlin this week by well-known german future trends researcher horst w. opaschowski and his colleagues at the b.a.t. leisure research institute in hamburg . " the days of plenty , of ease and luxurious living are over , " said opaschowski . no more state hand-outs the results are not likely to come as a surprise for the majority of germans . for some years now , the country 's generous welfare system , the envy of many western countries , is slowly beginning to lose its luster .
with an ageing population , declining birth rate , sluggish economy and rising unemployment , the once robust social system is crumbling . recent reforms initiated by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats and the junior coalition partner the greens - largely unpopular measures designed to reduce non-wage related costs and streamline the country 's benefits system - have meant a slash in unemployment benefits , additional health care costs and a reduction in pensions . continuing high unemployment but the latest study is still expected to provide some important pointers on how disengagement from a state-backed social security system is likely to affect germans in the coming years . opaschowski is certain germans will fret the most about unemployment in the next 10 to 20 years .
the country currently has an jobless rate of about 10.3 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is uncertain for a majority of germans .
the study , which is based on scientific research as well as a survey of 2,000 germans above the age of 14 , shows that among those questioned , 63 percent are concerned about affording health care , 59 percent worry about criminality and 57 about pensions . the future trend researchers give poor marks to germany 's political parties , who they say have n't managed to present the citizens with a concrete plan for the future .
all the policy programs until now have been just mere patchwork , according to the experts . " the future does n't have to be the big vision for the next 30 years .
rather the citizens actually want a step-by-step plan : we 're here in 2004 and this is happening , but in 2006 this is how it will be , " opaschowski said .
" but this kind of planning is n't happening in politics .
we hear everyday of what 's working , but we want to hear where it 's going . " self-help and individual performance despite the gloomy news , opaschowski is quick to point out that there 's light at the end of the tunnel and stresses that germans are realizing they ca n't wait for the state to spoon-feed them anymore . " they -lrb- the germans -rrb- have the impression that those at the top decision-making levels are n't managing alone .
they 're realizing they must take matters into their own hands and that the future will in no way be better than the present , " opaschowski said . according to the researchers the sobering realization is spurring germans to focus more on better performance and qualifications as well as fundamentally changing their perception of the state as the highest authority . " networks and citizens ' initiatives are gaining new significance .
the people want to achieve more things on their own and lead a more active life , " according to the study .
" help yourself before the state does , " is opaschowski 's verdict . " beacon of hope " the researchers are clear that the trend to help oneself is particularly conspicuous among younger germans .
according to the study , a new generation that increasingly defines itself through performance is on the rise .

with an ageing population , declining birth rate , sluggish economy and rising unemployment , the once robust social system is crumbling . recent reforms initiated by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats and the junior coalition partner the greens - largely unpopular measures designed to reduce non-wage related costs and streamline the country 's benefits system - have meant a slash in unemployment benefits , additional health care costs and a reduction in pensions . continuing high unemployment but the latest study is still expected to provide some important pointers on how disengagement from a state-backed social security system is likely to affect germans in the coming years . opaschowski is certain germans will fret the most about unemployment in the next 10 to 20 years .
the country currently has an jobless rate of about 10.3 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is uncertain for a majority of germans .
the study , which is based on scientific research as well as a survey of 2,000 germans above the age of 14 , shows that among those questioned , 63 percent are concerned about affording health care , 59 percent worry about criminality and 57 about pensions . the future trend researchers give poor marks to germany 's political parties , who they say have n't managed to present the citizens with a concrete plan for the future .
all the policy programs until now have been just mere patchwork , according to the experts . " the future does n't have to be the big vision for the next 30 years .
rather the citizens actually want a step-by-step plan : we 're here in 2004 and this is happening , but in 2006 this is how it will be , " opaschowski said .
" but this kind of planning is n't happening in politics .
we hear everyday of what 's working , but we want to hear where it 's going . " self-help and individual performance despite the gloomy news , opaschowski is quick to point out that there 's light at the end of the tunnel and stresses that germans are realizing they ca n't wait for the state to spoon-feed them anymore . " they -lrb- the germans -rrb- have the impression that those at the top decision-making levels are n't managing alone .
they 're realizing they must take matters into their own hands and that the future will in no way be better than the present , " opaschowski said . according to the researchers the sobering realization is spurring germans to focus more on better performance and qualifications as well as fundamentally changing their perception of the state as the highest authority . " networks and citizens ' initiatives are gaining new significance .
the people want to achieve more things on their own and lead a more active life , " according to the study .
" help yourself before the state does , " is opaschowski 's verdict . " beacon of hope " the researchers are clear that the trend to help oneself is particularly conspicuous among younger germans .

how will germans live in 2020 ?
more self-sufficiently as they learn to wean themselves off the generous social welfare system , according to researchers looking into the future . first the good news : germans , especially the younger generation , are increasingly fending for themselves and realizing the need to perform and excel instead of depending on dwindling state hand-outs and perks . they will account for around 40 percent of the population by 2010 and almost 50 by 2020 . on the flip side , germans will become increasingly plagued by worries of an insecure future in the face of rising unemployment and shrinking social benefits . that was the general conclusion of a study titled " germany 2020 .

portugal kicks-off against greece in the opening game of euro 2004 on saturday with the hopes of a nation resting on the host team 's ability to deliver nothing less than a win to raise the spirits . the european championships gets underway on saturday with the hosts portugal taking on group a opponents greece in the opening match at porto 's estádio do dragão .
for the home side , nothing less than victory will do in front of their own supporters who ache for a portugal team capable of putting years of under-achievement to rest .
the domestic success of porto , the country 's top league side , in both of the top european club competitions over the past two seasons has heightened expectations to fever pitch in the soccer-mad nation .
many fans are now convinced that the national side can replicate porto 's form and finally win a major international tournament .
portuguese coach luiz felipe scolari will be feeling the pressure even more so now as his players look for that all important first win against the greeks , who few expect to make an impact on the competition .
scolari 's players are well aware of the expectations of their home nation .
" pressure is usual in football , " said portuguese defender beto in an interview with cnn .
" we are confident and united to begin the championships with a win , responding to the expectations of our country . "
portugal wary of first opponents but beto and his teammates will be wary of the greeks who held portugal to a 1-1 draw in a friendly last year and also finished ahead of spain in their qualification group .
" they are a strong team , with a solid defense and a dangerous counterattacking game .
we know what we have to do to win , but for sure , we will face difficulties , " the defender added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scolari coached the brazilians to success at the 2002 world cup .
the coach will understand the concept of pressure better than most .
as brazil chief in the 2002 world cup , scolari had a legacy of great brazilian sides breathing down his neck as his samba stars looked to reclaim their title from france .
he succeeded in that attempt and will be looking to get the best out of the remnants from portugal 's " golden generation " as well as the new stars and emulate that feat at euro 2004 .
with a full-strength squad , portugal is in good shape as the tournament begins .
the opposition , however , are also firing on all cylinders as the tournament begins .
greek coach otto rehhagel has welcomed back striker demis nikolaidis and defender traianos dellas from injury in the greeks " nothing to lose " assault on the european championships .
" the pressure is on them , " said rehhagel of his team 's opponents on saturday .
" all the players have to do is place their hands on their heart and give the best for their country . "
most important game for greece in 20 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto rehhagel relishes the challenge of taking on the hosts in the first game .
the german coach believes that greece faces its biggest match in two decades against the hosts and is under no illusions .
" on saturday we have our most important game in the last 20 years , " rehhagel told german sports agency sid .
" for a greek team to be in the european championships after such a long time and to face hosts portugal is fantastic . " rehhagel will send his men out against the likes of luis figo , rui costa and brazilian-born deco , the instigator of porto 's recent successes , and admits that the task is a mighty one .
" i am nervous before such an event , " confessed rehhagel .
" we are not just up against portugal but against 60,000 fans . " this will be a unique experience for some of the players . " opening match may fail to sell-out however , news from the portuguese football federation may aid the greeks in their challenge .
a statement on friday expressed concerns that the crowd for the opening game may be well under capacity .

the failure to sell-out the 52,000-seater estádio do dragão raises questions on the enthusiasm the portuguese people have for the tournament .
a recent poll revealed that half of the population believes the event is not worth the € 800 million -lrb- $ 948 million -rrb- that has been spent on revamping 10 stadiums in eight cities , especially since portugal has economic woes . portugal 's economy has struggled since 1999 when it was awarded the event during a boom period .

how will germans live in 2020 ?
more self-sufficiently as they learn to wean themselves off the generous social welfare system , according to researchers looking into the future . first the good news : germans , especially the younger generation , are increasingly fending for themselves and realizing the need to perform and excel instead of depending on dwindling state hand-outs and perks . they will account for around 40 percent of the population by 2010 and almost 50 by 2020 . on the flip side , germans will become increasingly plagued by worries of an insecure future in the face of rising unemployment and shrinking social benefits . that was the general conclusion of a study titled " germany 2020 .
how we 'll live tomorrow " presented in berlin this week by well-known german future trends researcher horst w. opaschowski and his colleagues at the b.a.t. leisure research institute in hamburg . " the days of plenty , of ease and luxurious living are over , " said opaschowski . no more state hand-outs the results are not likely to come as a surprise for the majority of germans . for some years now , the country 's generous welfare system , the envy of many western countries , is slowly beginning to lose its luster .
with an ageing population , declining birth rate , sluggish economy and rising unemployment , the once robust social system is crumbling . recent reforms initiated by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats and the junior coalition partner the greens - largely unpopular measures designed to reduce non-wage related costs and streamline the country 's benefits system - have meant a slash in unemployment benefits , additional health care costs and a reduction in pensions . continuing high unemployment but the latest study is still expected to provide some important pointers on how disengagement from a state-backed social security system is likely to affect germans in the coming years . opaschowski is certain germans will fret the most about unemployment in the next 10 to 20 years .
the country currently has an jobless rate of about 10.3 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is uncertain for a majority of germans .
the study , which is based on scientific research as well as a survey of 2,000 germans above the age of 14 , shows that among those questioned , 63 percent are concerned about affording health care , 59 percent worry about criminality and 57 about pensions . the future trend researchers give poor marks to germany 's political parties , who they say have n't managed to present the citizens with a concrete plan for the future .
all the policy programs until now have been just mere patchwork , according to the experts . " the future does n't have to be the big vision for the next 30 years .
rather the citizens actually want a step-by-step plan : we 're here in 2004 and this is happening , but in 2006 this is how it will be , " opaschowski said .
" but this kind of planning is n't happening in politics .
we hear everyday of what 's working , but we want to hear where it 's going . " self-help and individual performance despite the gloomy news , opaschowski is quick to point out that there 's light at the end of the tunnel and stresses that germans are realizing they ca n't wait for the state to spoon-feed them anymore . " they -lrb- the germans -rrb- have the impression that those at the top decision-making levels are n't managing alone .
they 're realizing they must take matters into their own hands and that the future will in no way be better than the present , " opaschowski said . according to the researchers the sobering realization is spurring germans to focus more on better performance and qualifications as well as fundamentally changing their perception of the state as the highest authority . " networks and citizens ' initiatives are gaining new significance .
the people want to achieve more things on their own and lead a more active life , " according to the study .
" help yourself before the state does , " is opaschowski 's verdict . " beacon of hope " the researchers are clear that the trend to help oneself is particularly conspicuous among younger germans .
according to the study , a new generation that increasingly defines itself through performance is on the rise .
even germany 's deputy research minister wolf-michael catenhausen says , " the younger generation is the beacon of hope in the 21st century .

euro 2004 finally gets underway in portugal amid a sea of color and noise .
the host nation open the competition with the first match against the greeks in porto . when the whistle blows to start the soccer match between the hosts portugal and greece in the estádio do dragão in porto , it will signal the beginning of 23 days of excitement , tension , ecstasy and heartbreak as the 2004 european championships finally get underway .
the soccer showpiece opens with a ceremony which has so far been kept under wraps .
taking place 15 minutes before the kick-off of the opening game , the event will welcome the players and supporters from the 16 participating nations .
ana dias , who is responsible for organising the opening and closing ceremonies , gave a clue as to what could be expected , on the uefa website by saying : " after portugal discovered the world , it is time for the world to discover portugal at euro 2004 . "
that could indicate a nautical or exploration theme harking back to the golden days of discovery when portuguese sea farers like vasco da gama and ferdinand magellan led the european world in sea exploration during the fifteenth century .
whatever the main theme , dias has promised a display of color and music which will climax with the crowd joining the 700 performers in creating an ocean of people .
that will lead the way to the sixteen nations contesting for the right to hold the henri delauney trophy aloft on july 4 at the estádio da luz in lisbon and become the 2004 european champions .
it is a far cry from the four team tournament that heralded the introduction of the championships onto the international stage back in 1960 .
since that first championship in france , the number of participating nations has swelled the tournament to its current size , which was first introduced with the successful shared event in the netherlands and belgium in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans paint their faces in the colors of the greek and portuguese teams .
an ever changing concept the european championship finals have seen many changes in their 44 year history .
not only has the number of teams fighting it out been increased since its inception but its structure has also developed and the tournament has seen the introduction of new innovations in the game .
in 1968 the championships changed from its original knock-out formula , where a team would have just one game against an opponent to see who advanced to the next round , to the qualification groups that are still in place today , where four teams play each other once with the top two teams going through .
the tournament in england in 1996 saw the introduction of the " golden goal " rule , the first time the decider had been used in a major international tournament .
before when two teams were drawn after 90 minutes , they would have the whole extra-time period to win the game .
this time if the matches were deadlocked by the end of regulation time , the games would be decided by the first team to score the " golden goal " in that extra half an hour .
a fanfare for every game there will also be a new feature this year , although not one associated with the playing of the game itself .
for the first time in a uefa european championship , all of the matches , not just the opening one , will be preceded by a short welcome ceremony in the centre of the pitch , lasting three minutes .
this year 's tournament will see some of the greatest names in the history of the finals going head to head for the title of european champion .
the russians , who won the first ever championship and dominated the subsequent early tournaments of the sixties , return to the fray while the germans look to improve on their impressive record by stretching their lead as the team with the most championship wins to four .
a competition of tradition and innovation france , the current holders and first team to win the championships as world champions , will be looking to hang onto the trophy that carries the name of the countryman who envisaged and developed the concept of the finals after losing their world cup title in japan / korea two years ago .
if they do so , it will be les bleus third triumph at the finals after wins in 1984 and 2000 .
the inclusion of latvia this year will also have special significance .
although euro 2004 will be the baltic country 's third championship , it will be the first undertaken with official european union membership , secured during the recent accession at the beginning of may .
as a fully paid up member of the bloc , latvia will truly be a european contender , if only in name .
despite spirited performances in the 1996 and 2000 finals , it is unlikely that the latvians will progress to the latter stages of the competition .
those teams aside , there will be 13 other nations fielding a host of high-profile stars who will pound the portuguese turf in their country 's cause , bringing the continent 's major players together for a festival of football in the mediterranean sun .
global stars bring their skills to europe fans in the stadiums and at home will get the chance to see the likes of zinedine zidane and david beckham battle for midfield supremacy when france take on england ; watch open-mouthed as holland 's ruud van nistlerooy tests the goalkeeping skills of germany 's oliver kahn , and experience the riotous atmosphere between the neighbours when portugal 's christiano ronaldo bears down on spanish defender carles puyol .
these and many other enthralling contests await the viewing public .
with each passing year , the european championships increase in size , prestige and profile .

she died at age 15 in a concentration camp , but her diary survived to tell the story that has shaped the world 's image of the holocaust .
on june 12 anne frank would have turned 75 . if her father had not published her diary after world war ii , anne frank would have simply been one among six million jews killed by the nazis .
but the publication of the now famous diary of anne frank lifted the young girl from the anonymous mass of victims and turned her into the face of the holocaust . first published in 1947 , the book has sold more than 25 million copies and has been translated into more than 50 languages .
in 1959 her story was turned into a three-time oscar winning film . anne 's account of the war years is now the subject of a japanese animation film as well as several plays and her diary is required reading in schools around the world .
the hiding place of the frank family , the present-day anne frank huis in amsterdam , is also the most-visited holocaust museum worldwide .
last year the museum registered a new visitor record with over 900,000 people . to coincide with anne 's 75th birthday on june 12 , the anne frank center in germany has released hitherto unpublished photographs from the frank family album shot by anne 's father otto frank . bildunterschrift : anne frank -lrb- left -rrb- stands with her sister margot on the beach in the netherlands in july 1938 . putting a face on the death of millions anne frank 's diary offers readers a glimpse into the mind and emotions of a young girl , shortly before she was packed off to a concentration camp . between 1942 and 1944 , anne confided her personal thoughts and problems to the orange-and-grey checked book , which she received as a gift on her 13th birthday .
the diary is a document of the desperate attempts at survival by a jewish family during nazi persecution . " it 's an individual fate that gave this horrible number of murdered people a face .
that has made anne frank a symbol , " says thomas heppener from the anne frank museum in amsterdam . in 1933 after hitler came to power , the franks fled to amsterdam where otto frank set up a company , which sold pectin used to make jelly and jams .
the family led a normal life until the tranquility ended abruptly in 1940 when germany occupied the netherlands and began implementing anti-jewish measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the family hid themselves in a couple of empty back rooms in otto frank 's office building .
while work continued as usual in the front room and storehouses , the franks lived quietly in the back together with another family .
a staircase connected the two buildings , the opening to which was camouflaged with a hinged bookcase which served as a door .
the families depended on several of ottofrank 's loyal employees to bring them food and keep their secret . anne and kitty it was during this time that the diary became anne 's best friend .
she named it kitty .
anne penned her thoughts and wishes in the diary and described the tensions and quarrels that erupted from a covert life in cramped quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an undated file photo of anne frank .
she also detailed nights filled with fear as bombs rained down on amsterdam or when strangers came to the office during the day and the franks had to stay absolutely still for hours in their hide-out . in august 1944 however the franks were betrayed .
it still remains unclear by whom .
what is known is that the ss , the elite nazi paramilitary corps stormed the hide-out and brought the franks to a labor camp in the netherlands .
some time later they were transported in cattle cars to auschwitz and later to bergen-belsen , germany . in march 1945 , just weeks before liberation , anne and her sister died of typhoid .
from the eight people who hid in the frank annex in amsterdam , only anne 's father survived the holocaust . controversy over diary 's authenticity though otto frank 's publication of anne 's diary in 1947 sparked much interest , it was n't long before skeptics raised their doubts over the authenticity of the document .
it took a few years before an authentic version was published . " before then passages that were anti-german had been cut out , " said nicolas berg from the leipzig-based simon dunow institute for german-jewish history .
according to berg , the passages were considered too provocative for post-war german readers . finally in 1981 , the dutch state issued an authentication certificate that laid all doubts to rest . comprehending the holocaust more than 50 years later , anne frank 's diary has n't lost its significance .
heppener said the diary " is also a document of a young girl 's adolescent problems . "
anne , who describes her discomfort over her maturing body and uncertainty about her first love , gives voice to emotions shared around the world .
" especially young women can identify strongly with her story because it throws up questions that are relevant even for teenagers today . " heppener believes that the identification with anne frank helps young people gain an introduction to the holocaust .

france 's highest court rejected the request for a retrial by the country ’ s most famous nazi collaborator on friday : ninety-three year old maurice papon will not get a chance to fight his conviction for war crimes . the unexpectedly quick ruling by france 's highest court came after just a few hours .
the court de cassation , which examined whether proper legal procedure was followed ahead of papon ‘ s conviction in 1998 for complicity in crimes against humanity and organizing the deportation of jews to nazi death camps , ruled that the country 's most senior official from the pro-nazi vichy regime did not deserve a retrial .
the court was not asked to judge papon 's guilt or innocence , but whether there were legal grounds for awarding the collaborator a retrial as requested .
it said there was no reason to oblige papon and rejected his final attempt at appeal .
lawyers for papon , who was not present during the court 's deliberation , said they will ask the court 's review panel to overturn friday 's decision .
papon , who rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii to become chief of the paris police and later federal budget minister , has been trying to clear his name ever since a court in the southwestern city of bordeaux found him guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity in 1998 .
papon , whose involvement in organizing the deportation came to light in the early 1980s after documents were discovered , claims he did not know of the fate of the jews he deported and that he had only been following orders given to him by the vichy government , which sided with the nazis for most of world war ii .
he argued that he could n't be held partially responsible for the ghastly crimes committed in the nazi death camps , because he was removed by several " links in the chain . "
quest for a retrial after serving only three years of the 10-year sentence , papon was released for reasons of poor health .
he then left france for switzerland and requested a retrial of his case saying he could not be held accountable for crimes against humanity because he was indirectly involved .
the appeals court promptly rejected papon 's request because he was not in france at the time .
however , the european court of human rights has since ruled that the french law requiring appellants to turn themselves over to police custody on the eve of their hearing violates eu law on fair trials .
this opened the way to friday 's review .
the court 's review of the appeal touched on a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the papon case as an example of the extent of nazi sympathy in france during the war .
members of the association of sons and daughters of deported jews of france protested in front of the justice palace to demonstrate their anger with a legal system that could give someone like papon a second chance to fight his conviction .
during world war ii some 76,000 jews , including 12,000 children , were deported from france , many to the death camps in auschwitz .
only 2,500 of them survived . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

portugal kicks-off against greece in the opening game of euro 2004 on saturday with the hopes of a nation resting on the host team 's ability to deliver nothing less than a win to raise the spirits . the european championships gets underway on saturday with the hosts portugal taking on group a opponents greece in the opening match at porto 's estádio do dragão .
for the home side , nothing less than victory will do in front of their own supporters who ache for a portugal team capable of putting years of under-achievement to rest .
the domestic success of porto , the country 's top league side , in both of the top european club competitions over the past two seasons has heightened expectations to fever pitch in the soccer-mad nation .
many fans are now convinced that the national side can replicate porto 's form and finally win a major international tournament .
portuguese coach luiz felipe scolari will be feeling the pressure even more so now as his players look for that all important first win against the greeks , who few expect to make an impact on the competition .
scolari 's players are well aware of the expectations of their home nation .
" pressure is usual in football , " said portuguese defender beto in an interview with cnn .
" we are confident and united to begin the championships with a win , responding to the expectations of our country . "
portugal wary of first opponents but beto and his teammates will be wary of the greeks who held portugal to a 1-1 draw in a friendly last year and also finished ahead of spain in their qualification group .
" they are a strong team , with a solid defense and a dangerous counterattacking game .
we know what we have to do to win , but for sure , we will face difficulties , " the defender added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scolari coached the brazilians to success at the 2002 world cup .
the coach will understand the concept of pressure better than most .
as brazil chief in the 2002 world cup , scolari had a legacy of great brazilian sides breathing down his neck as his samba stars looked to reclaim their title from france .
he succeeded in that attempt and will be looking to get the best out of the remnants from portugal 's " golden generation " as well as the new stars and emulate that feat at euro 2004 .
with a full-strength squad , portugal is in good shape as the tournament begins .
the opposition , however , are also firing on all cylinders as the tournament begins .
greek coach otto rehhagel has welcomed back striker demis nikolaidis and defender traianos dellas from injury in the greeks " nothing to lose " assault on the european championships .
" the pressure is on them , " said rehhagel of his team 's opponents on saturday .
" all the players have to do is place their hands on their heart and give the best for their country . "
most important game for greece in 20 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto rehhagel relishes the challenge of taking on the hosts in the first game .
the german coach believes that greece faces its biggest match in two decades against the hosts and is under no illusions .
" on saturday we have our most important game in the last 20 years , " rehhagel told german sports agency sid .
" for a greek team to be in the european championships after such a long time and to face hosts portugal is fantastic . " rehhagel will send his men out against the likes of luis figo , rui costa and brazilian-born deco , the instigator of porto 's recent successes , and admits that the task is a mighty one .
" i am nervous before such an event , " confessed rehhagel .
" we are not just up against portugal but against 60,000 fans . " this will be a unique experience for some of the players . " opening match may fail to sell-out however , news from the portuguese football federation may aid the greeks in their challenge .

how will germans live in 2020 ?
more self-sufficiently as they learn to wean themselves off the generous social welfare system , according to researchers looking into the future . first the good news : germans , especially the younger generation , are increasingly fending for themselves and realizing the need to perform and excel instead of depending on dwindling state hand-outs and perks . they will account for around 40 percent of the population by 2010 and almost 50 by 2020 . on the flip side , germans will become increasingly plagued by worries of an insecure future in the face of rising unemployment and shrinking social benefits . that was the general conclusion of a study titled " germany 2020 .
how we 'll live tomorrow " presented in berlin this week by well-known german future trends researcher horst w. opaschowski and his colleagues at the b.a.t. leisure research institute in hamburg . " the days of plenty , of ease and luxurious living are over , " said opaschowski . no more state hand-outs the results are not likely to come as a surprise for the majority of germans . for some years now , the country 's generous welfare system , the envy of many western countries , is slowly beginning to lose its luster .
with an ageing population , declining birth rate , sluggish economy and rising unemployment , the once robust social system is crumbling . recent reforms initiated by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats and the junior coalition partner the greens - largely unpopular measures designed to reduce non-wage related costs and streamline the country 's benefits system - have meant a slash in unemployment benefits , additional health care costs and a reduction in pensions . continuing high unemployment but the latest study is still expected to provide some important pointers on how disengagement from a state-backed social security system is likely to affect germans in the coming years . opaschowski is certain germans will fret the most about unemployment in the next 10 to 20 years .
the country currently has an jobless rate of about 10.3 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is uncertain for a majority of germans .
the study , which is based on scientific research as well as a survey of 2,000 germans above the age of 14 , shows that among those questioned , 63 percent are concerned about affording health care , 59 percent worry about criminality and 57 about pensions . the future trend researchers give poor marks to germany 's political parties , who they say have n't managed to present the citizens with a concrete plan for the future .
all the policy programs until now have been just mere patchwork , according to the experts . " the future does n't have to be the big vision for the next 30 years .
rather the citizens actually want a step-by-step plan : we 're here in 2004 and this is happening , but in 2006 this is how it will be , " opaschowski said .
" but this kind of planning is n't happening in politics .
we hear everyday of what 's working , but we want to hear where it 's going . " self-help and individual performance despite the gloomy news , opaschowski is quick to point out that there 's light at the end of the tunnel and stresses that germans are realizing they ca n't wait for the state to spoon-feed them anymore . " they -lrb- the germans -rrb- have the impression that those at the top decision-making levels are n't managing alone .
they 're realizing they must take matters into their own hands and that the future will in no way be better than the present , " opaschowski said . according to the researchers the sobering realization is spurring germans to focus more on better performance and qualifications as well as fundamentally changing their perception of the state as the highest authority . " networks and citizens ' initiatives are gaining new significance .
the people want to achieve more things on their own and lead a more active life , " according to the study .
" help yourself before the state does , " is opaschowski 's verdict . " beacon of hope " the researchers are clear that the trend to help oneself is particularly conspicuous among younger germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.06.2004 anne frank : the face of the holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she could have been a grandmother today .
she died at age 15 in a concentration camp , but her diary survived to tell the story that has shaped the world 's image of the holocaust .
on june 12 anne frank would have turned 75 . if her father had not published her diary after world war ii , anne frank would have simply been one among six million jews killed by the nazis .
but the publication of the now famous diary of anne frank lifted the young girl from the anonymous mass of victims and turned her into the face of the holocaust . first published in 1947 , the book has sold more than 25 million copies and has been translated into more than 50 languages .
in 1959 her story was turned into a three-time oscar winning film . anne 's account of the war years is now the subject of a japanese animation film as well as several plays and her diary is required reading in schools around the world .
the hiding place of the frank family , the present-day anne frank huis in amsterdam , is also the most-visited holocaust museum worldwide .
last year the museum registered a new visitor record with over 900,000 people . to coincide with anne 's 75th birthday on june 12 , the anne frank center in germany has released hitherto unpublished photographs from the frank family album shot by anne 's father otto frank . bildunterschrift : anne frank -lrb- left -rrb- stands with her sister margot on the beach in the netherlands in july 1938 . putting a face on the death of millions anne frank 's diary offers readers a glimpse into the mind and emotions of a young girl , shortly before she was packed off to a concentration camp . between 1942 and 1944 , anne confided her personal thoughts and problems to the orange-and-grey checked book , which she received as a gift on her 13th birthday .
the diary is a document of the desperate attempts at survival by a jewish family during nazi persecution . " it 's an individual fate that gave this horrible number of murdered people a face .
that has made anne frank a symbol , " says thomas heppener from the anne frank museum in amsterdam . in 1933 after hitler came to power , the franks fled to amsterdam where otto frank set up a company , which sold pectin used to make jelly and jams .

she died at age 15 in a concentration camp , but her diary survived to tell the story that has shaped the world 's image of the holocaust .
on june 12 anne frank would have turned 75 . if her father had not published her diary after world war ii , anne frank would have simply been one among six million jews killed by the nazis .
but the publication of the now famous diary of anne frank lifted the young girl from the anonymous mass of victims and turned her into the face of the holocaust . first published in 1947 , the book has sold more than 25 million copies and has been translated into more than 50 languages .
in 1959 her story was turned into a three-time oscar winning film . anne 's account of the war years is now the subject of a japanese animation film as well as several plays and her diary is required reading in schools around the world .
the hiding place of the frank family , the present-day anne frank huis in amsterdam , is also the most-visited holocaust museum worldwide .
last year the museum registered a new visitor record with over 900,000 people . to coincide with anne 's 75th birthday on june 12 , the anne frank center in germany has released hitherto unpublished photographs from the frank family album shot by anne 's father otto frank . bildunterschrift : anne frank -lrb- left -rrb- stands with her sister margot on the beach in the netherlands in july 1938 . putting a face on the death of millions anne frank 's diary offers readers a glimpse into the mind and emotions of a young girl , shortly before she was packed off to a concentration camp . between 1942 and 1944 , anne confided her personal thoughts and problems to the orange-and-grey checked book , which she received as a gift on her 13th birthday .
the diary is a document of the desperate attempts at survival by a jewish family during nazi persecution . " it 's an individual fate that gave this horrible number of murdered people a face .
that has made anne frank a symbol , " says thomas heppener from the anne frank museum in amsterdam . in 1933 after hitler came to power , the franks fled to amsterdam where otto frank set up a company , which sold pectin used to make jelly and jams .
the family led a normal life until the tranquility ended abruptly in 1940 when germany occupied the netherlands and began implementing anti-jewish measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the family hid themselves in a couple of empty back rooms in otto frank 's office building .
while work continued as usual in the front room and storehouses , the franks lived quietly in the back together with another family .
a staircase connected the two buildings , the opening to which was camouflaged with a hinged bookcase which served as a door .
the families depended on several of ottofrank 's loyal employees to bring them food and keep their secret . anne and kitty it was during this time that the diary became anne 's best friend .
she named it kitty .
anne penned her thoughts and wishes in the diary and described the tensions and quarrels that erupted from a covert life in cramped quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an undated file photo of anne frank .
she also detailed nights filled with fear as bombs rained down on amsterdam or when strangers came to the office during the day and the franks had to stay absolutely still for hours in their hide-out . in august 1944 however the franks were betrayed .
it still remains unclear by whom .
what is known is that the ss , the elite nazi paramilitary corps stormed the hide-out and brought the franks to a labor camp in the netherlands .
some time later they were transported in cattle cars to auschwitz and later to bergen-belsen , germany . in march 1945 , just weeks before liberation , anne and her sister died of typhoid .
from the eight people who hid in the frank annex in amsterdam , only anne 's father survived the holocaust . controversy over diary 's authenticity though otto frank 's publication of anne 's diary in 1947 sparked much interest , it was n't long before skeptics raised their doubts over the authenticity of the document .
it took a few years before an authentic version was published . " before then passages that were anti-german had been cut out , " said nicolas berg from the leipzig-based simon dunow institute for german-jewish history .
according to berg , the passages were considered too provocative for post-war german readers . finally in 1981 , the dutch state issued an authentication certificate that laid all doubts to rest . comprehending the holocaust more than 50 years later , anne frank 's diary has n't lost its significance .
heppener said the diary " is also a document of a young girl 's adolescent problems . "
anne , who describes her discomfort over her maturing body and uncertainty about her first love , gives voice to emotions shared around the world .
" especially young women can identify strongly with her story because it throws up questions that are relevant even for teenagers today . " heppener believes that the identification with anne frank helps young people gain an introduction to the holocaust .
a young girl who dies in the face of the nazi death machine allows many to grasp the ghastly reality of the holocaust , he says . silke ballweg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

more self-sufficiently as they learn to wean themselves off the generous social welfare system , according to researchers looking into the future . first the good news : germans , especially the younger generation , are increasingly fending for themselves and realizing the need to perform and excel instead of depending on dwindling state hand-outs and perks . they will account for around 40 percent of the population by 2010 and almost 50 by 2020 . on the flip side , germans will become increasingly plagued by worries of an insecure future in the face of rising unemployment and shrinking social benefits . that was the general conclusion of a study titled " germany 2020 .
how we 'll live tomorrow " presented in berlin this week by well-known german future trends researcher horst w. opaschowski and his colleagues at the b.a.t. leisure research institute in hamburg . " the days of plenty , of ease and luxurious living are over , " said opaschowski . no more state hand-outs the results are not likely to come as a surprise for the majority of germans . for some years now , the country 's generous welfare system , the envy of many western countries , is slowly beginning to lose its luster .
with an ageing population , declining birth rate , sluggish economy and rising unemployment , the once robust social system is crumbling . recent reforms initiated by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats and the junior coalition partner the greens - largely unpopular measures designed to reduce non-wage related costs and streamline the country 's benefits system - have meant a slash in unemployment benefits , additional health care costs and a reduction in pensions . continuing high unemployment but the latest study is still expected to provide some important pointers on how disengagement from a state-backed social security system is likely to affect germans in the coming years . opaschowski is certain germans will fret the most about unemployment in the next 10 to 20 years .
the country currently has an jobless rate of about 10.3 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is uncertain for a majority of germans .
the study , which is based on scientific research as well as a survey of 2,000 germans above the age of 14 , shows that among those questioned , 63 percent are concerned about affording health care , 59 percent worry about criminality and 57 about pensions . the future trend researchers give poor marks to germany 's political parties , who they say have n't managed to present the citizens with a concrete plan for the future .
all the policy programs until now have been just mere patchwork , according to the experts . " the future does n't have to be the big vision for the next 30 years .
rather the citizens actually want a step-by-step plan : we 're here in 2004 and this is happening , but in 2006 this is how it will be , " opaschowski said .
" but this kind of planning is n't happening in politics .
we hear everyday of what 's working , but we want to hear where it 's going . " self-help and individual performance despite the gloomy news , opaschowski is quick to point out that there 's light at the end of the tunnel and stresses that germans are realizing they ca n't wait for the state to spoon-feed them anymore . " they -lrb- the germans -rrb- have the impression that those at the top decision-making levels are n't managing alone .
they 're realizing they must take matters into their own hands and that the future will in no way be better than the present , " opaschowski said . according to the researchers the sobering realization is spurring germans to focus more on better performance and qualifications as well as fundamentally changing their perception of the state as the highest authority . " networks and citizens ' initiatives are gaining new significance .
the people want to achieve more things on their own and lead a more active life , " according to the study .
" help yourself before the state does , " is opaschowski 's verdict . " beacon of hope " the researchers are clear that the trend to help oneself is particularly conspicuous among younger germans .

more self-sufficiently as they learn to wean themselves off the generous social welfare system , according to researchers looking into the future . first the good news : germans , especially the younger generation , are increasingly fending for themselves and realizing the need to perform and excel instead of depending on dwindling state hand-outs and perks . they will account for around 40 percent of the population by 2010 and almost 50 by 2020 . on the flip side , germans will become increasingly plagued by worries of an insecure future in the face of rising unemployment and shrinking social benefits . that was the general conclusion of a study titled " germany 2020 .
how we 'll live tomorrow " presented in berlin this week by well-known german future trends researcher horst w. opaschowski and his colleagues at the b.a.t. leisure research institute in hamburg . " the days of plenty , of ease and luxurious living are over , " said opaschowski . no more state hand-outs the results are not likely to come as a surprise for the majority of germans . for some years now , the country 's generous welfare system , the envy of many western countries , is slowly beginning to lose its luster .
with an ageing population , declining birth rate , sluggish economy and rising unemployment , the once robust social system is crumbling . recent reforms initiated by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats and the junior coalition partner the greens - largely unpopular measures designed to reduce non-wage related costs and streamline the country 's benefits system - have meant a slash in unemployment benefits , additional health care costs and a reduction in pensions . continuing high unemployment but the latest study is still expected to provide some important pointers on how disengagement from a state-backed social security system is likely to affect germans in the coming years . opaschowski is certain germans will fret the most about unemployment in the next 10 to 20 years .
the country currently has an jobless rate of about 10.3 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is uncertain for a majority of germans .
the study , which is based on scientific research as well as a survey of 2,000 germans above the age of 14 , shows that among those questioned , 63 percent are concerned about affording health care , 59 percent worry about criminality and 57 about pensions . the future trend researchers give poor marks to germany 's political parties , who they say have n't managed to present the citizens with a concrete plan for the future .
all the policy programs until now have been just mere patchwork , according to the experts . " the future does n't have to be the big vision for the next 30 years .
rather the citizens actually want a step-by-step plan : we 're here in 2004 and this is happening , but in 2006 this is how it will be , " opaschowski said .
" but this kind of planning is n't happening in politics .

" they -lrb- the germans -rrb- have the impression that those at the top decision-making levels are n't managing alone .
they 're realizing they must take matters into their own hands and that the future will in no way be better than the present , " opaschowski said . according to the researchers the sobering realization is spurring germans to focus more on better performance and qualifications as well as fundamentally changing their perception of the state as the highest authority .

the people want to achieve more things on their own and lead a more active life , " according to the study .
" help yourself before the state does , " is opaschowski 's verdict . " beacon of hope " the researchers are clear that the trend to help oneself is particularly conspicuous among younger germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.06.2004 french court rejects retrial of nazi collaborator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maurice papon has been fighting to clear his name since convicted in 1998 .
france 's highest court rejected the request for a retrial by the country ’ s most famous nazi collaborator on friday : ninety-three year old maurice papon will not get a chance to fight his conviction for war crimes . the unexpectedly quick ruling by france 's highest court came after just a few hours .
the court de cassation , which examined whether proper legal procedure was followed ahead of papon ‘ s conviction in 1998 for complicity in crimes against humanity and organizing the deportation of jews to nazi death camps , ruled that the country 's most senior official from the pro-nazi vichy regime did not deserve a retrial .
the court was not asked to judge papon 's guilt or innocence , but whether there were legal grounds for awarding the collaborator a retrial as requested .
it said there was no reason to oblige papon and rejected his final attempt at appeal .
lawyers for papon , who was not present during the court 's deliberation , said they will ask the court 's review panel to overturn friday 's decision .
papon , who rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii to become chief of the paris police and later federal budget minister , has been trying to clear his name ever since a court in the southwestern city of bordeaux found him guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity in 1998 .
papon , whose involvement in organizing the deportation came to light in the early 1980s after documents were discovered , claims he did not know of the fate of the jews he deported and that he had only been following orders given to him by the vichy government , which sided with the nazis for most of world war ii .
he argued that he could n't be held partially responsible for the ghastly crimes committed in the nazi death camps , because he was removed by several " links in the chain . "
quest for a retrial after serving only three years of the 10-year sentence , papon was released for reasons of poor health .
he then left france for switzerland and requested a retrial of his case saying he could not be held accountable for crimes against humanity because he was indirectly involved .
the appeals court promptly rejected papon 's request because he was not in france at the time .
however , the european court of human rights has since ruled that the french law requiring appellants to turn themselves over to police custody on the eve of their hearing violates eu law on fair trials .
this opened the way to friday 's review .
the court 's review of the appeal touched on a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the papon case as an example of the extent of nazi sympathy in france during the war .
members of the association of sons and daughters of deported jews of france protested in front of the justice palace to demonstrate their anger with a legal system that could give someone like papon a second chance to fight his conviction .
during world war ii some 76,000 jews , including 12,000 children , were deported from france , many to the death camps in auschwitz .
only 2,500 of them survived . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

she died at age 15 in a concentration camp , but her diary survived to tell the story that has shaped the world 's image of the holocaust .
on june 12 anne frank would have turned 75 . if her father had not published her diary after world war ii , anne frank would have simply been one among six million jews killed by the nazis .
but the publication of the now famous diary of anne frank lifted the young girl from the anonymous mass of victims and turned her into the face of the holocaust . first published in 1947 , the book has sold more than 25 million copies and has been translated into more than 50 languages .
in 1959 her story was turned into a three-time oscar winning film . anne 's account of the war years is now the subject of a japanese animation film as well as several plays and her diary is required reading in schools around the world .
the hiding place of the frank family , the present-day anne frank huis in amsterdam , is also the most-visited holocaust museum worldwide .
last year the museum registered a new visitor record with over 900,000 people . to coincide with anne 's 75th birthday on june 12 , the anne frank center in germany has released hitherto unpublished photographs from the frank family album shot by anne 's father otto frank . bildunterschrift : anne frank -lrb- left -rrb- stands with her sister margot on the beach in the netherlands in july 1938 . putting a face on the death of millions anne frank 's diary offers readers a glimpse into the mind and emotions of a young girl , shortly before she was packed off to a concentration camp . between 1942 and 1944 , anne confided her personal thoughts and problems to the orange-and-grey checked book , which she received as a gift on her 13th birthday .
the diary is a document of the desperate attempts at survival by a jewish family during nazi persecution . " it 's an individual fate that gave this horrible number of murdered people a face .
that has made anne frank a symbol , " says thomas heppener from the anne frank museum in amsterdam . in 1933 after hitler came to power , the franks fled to amsterdam where otto frank set up a company , which sold pectin used to make jelly and jams .
the family led a normal life until the tranquility ended abruptly in 1940 when germany occupied the netherlands and began implementing anti-jewish measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the family hid themselves in a couple of empty back rooms in otto frank 's office building .
while work continued as usual in the front room and storehouses , the franks lived quietly in the back together with another family .
a staircase connected the two buildings , the opening to which was camouflaged with a hinged bookcase which served as a door .
the families depended on several of ottofrank 's loyal employees to bring them food and keep their secret . anne and kitty it was during this time that the diary became anne 's best friend .
she named it kitty .
anne penned her thoughts and wishes in the diary and described the tensions and quarrels that erupted from a covert life in cramped quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an undated file photo of anne frank .
she also detailed nights filled with fear as bombs rained down on amsterdam or when strangers came to the office during the day and the franks had to stay absolutely still for hours in their hide-out . in august 1944 however the franks were betrayed .
it still remains unclear by whom .
what is known is that the ss , the elite nazi paramilitary corps stormed the hide-out and brought the franks to a labor camp in the netherlands .
some time later they were transported in cattle cars to auschwitz and later to bergen-belsen , germany . in march 1945 , just weeks before liberation , anne and her sister died of typhoid .
from the eight people who hid in the frank annex in amsterdam , only anne 's father survived the holocaust . controversy over diary 's authenticity though otto frank 's publication of anne 's diary in 1947 sparked much interest , it was n't long before skeptics raised their doubts over the authenticity of the document .
it took a few years before an authentic version was published . " before then passages that were anti-german had been cut out , " said nicolas berg from the leipzig-based simon dunow institute for german-jewish history .
according to berg , the passages were considered too provocative for post-war german readers . finally in 1981 , the dutch state issued an authentication certificate that laid all doubts to rest . comprehending the holocaust more than 50 years later , anne frank 's diary has n't lost its significance .
heppener said the diary " is also a document of a young girl 's adolescent problems . "
anne , who describes her discomfort over her maturing body and uncertainty about her first love , gives voice to emotions shared around the world .
" especially young women can identify strongly with her story because it throws up questions that are relevant even for teenagers today . " heppener believes that the identification with anne frank helps young people gain an introduction to the holocaust .
a young girl who dies in the face of the nazi death machine allows many to grasp the ghastly reality of the holocaust , he says . silke ballweg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

the families depended on several of ottofrank 's loyal employees to bring them food and keep their secret . anne and kitty it was during this time that the diary became anne 's best friend .
she named it kitty .
anne penned her thoughts and wishes in the diary and described the tensions and quarrels that erupted from a covert life in cramped quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an undated file photo of anne frank .
she also detailed nights filled with fear as bombs rained down on amsterdam or when strangers came to the office during the day and the franks had to stay absolutely still for hours in their hide-out . in august 1944 however the franks were betrayed .
it still remains unclear by whom .
what is known is that the ss , the elite nazi paramilitary corps stormed the hide-out and brought the franks to a labor camp in the netherlands .
some time later they were transported in cattle cars to auschwitz and later to bergen-belsen , germany . in march 1945 , just weeks before liberation , anne and her sister died of typhoid .
from the eight people who hid in the frank annex in amsterdam , only anne 's father survived the holocaust . controversy over diary 's authenticity though otto frank 's publication of anne 's diary in 1947 sparked much interest , it was n't long before skeptics raised their doubts over the authenticity of the document .
it took a few years before an authentic version was published . " before then passages that were anti-german had been cut out , " said nicolas berg from the leipzig-based simon dunow institute for german-jewish history .
according to berg , the passages were considered too provocative for post-war german readers . finally in 1981 , the dutch state issued an authentication certificate that laid all doubts to rest . comprehending the holocaust more than 50 years later , anne frank 's diary has n't lost its significance .
heppener said the diary " is also a document of a young girl 's adolescent problems . "
anne , who describes her discomfort over her maturing body and uncertainty about her first love , gives voice to emotions shared around the world .
" especially young women can identify strongly with her story because it throws up questions that are relevant even for teenagers today . " heppener believes that the identification with anne frank helps young people gain an introduction to the holocaust .
a young girl who dies in the face of the nazi death machine allows many to grasp the ghastly reality of the holocaust , he says . silke ballweg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.06.2004 french court rejects retrial of nazi collaborator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maurice papon has been fighting to clear his name since convicted in 1998 .
france 's highest court rejected the request for a retrial by the country ’ s most famous nazi collaborator on friday : ninety-three year old maurice papon will not get a chance to fight his conviction for war crimes . the unexpectedly quick ruling by france 's highest court came after just a few hours .
the court de cassation , which examined whether proper legal procedure was followed ahead of papon ‘ s conviction in 1998 for complicity in crimes against humanity and organizing the deportation of jews to nazi death camps , ruled that the country 's most senior official from the pro-nazi vichy regime did not deserve a retrial .
the court was not asked to judge papon 's guilt or innocence , but whether there were legal grounds for awarding the collaborator a retrial as requested .
it said there was no reason to oblige papon and rejected his final attempt at appeal .
lawyers for papon , who was not present during the court 's deliberation , said they will ask the court 's review panel to overturn friday 's decision .
papon , who rose through the ranks of french politics following world war ii to become chief of the paris police and later federal budget minister , has been trying to clear his name ever since a court in the southwestern city of bordeaux found him guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity in 1998 .
papon , whose involvement in organizing the deportation came to light in the early 1980s after documents were discovered , claims he did not know of the fate of the jews he deported and that he had only been following orders given to him by the vichy government , which sided with the nazis for most of world war ii .
he argued that he could n't be held partially responsible for the ghastly crimes committed in the nazi death camps , because he was removed by several " links in the chain . "
quest for a retrial after serving only three years of the 10-year sentence , papon was released for reasons of poor health .
he then left france for switzerland and requested a retrial of his case saying he could not be held accountable for crimes against humanity because he was indirectly involved .
the appeals court promptly rejected papon 's request because he was not in france at the time .
however , the european court of human rights has since ruled that the french law requiring appellants to turn themselves over to police custody on the eve of their hearing violates eu law on fair trials .
this opened the way to friday 's review .
the court 's review of the appeal touched on a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the papon case as an example of the extent of nazi sympathy in france during the war .
members of the association of sons and daughters of deported jews of france protested in front of the justice palace to demonstrate their anger with a legal system that could give someone like papon a second chance to fight his conviction .
during world war ii some 76,000 jews , including 12,000 children , were deported from france , many to the death camps in auschwitz .
only 2,500 of them survived . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

papon , whose involvement in organizing the deportation came to light in the early 1980s after documents were discovered , claims he did not know of the fate of the jews he deported and that he had only been following orders given to him by the vichy government , which sided with the nazis for most of world war ii .
he argued that he could n't be held partially responsible for the ghastly crimes committed in the nazi death camps , because he was removed by several " links in the chain . "
quest for a retrial after serving only three years of the 10-year sentence , papon was released for reasons of poor health .
he then left france for switzerland and requested a retrial of his case saying he could not be held accountable for crimes against humanity because he was indirectly involved .
the appeals court promptly rejected papon 's request because he was not in france at the time .
however , the european court of human rights has since ruled that the french law requiring appellants to turn themselves over to police custody on the eve of their hearing violates eu law on fair trials .
this opened the way to friday 's review .
the court 's review of the appeal touched on a sensitive nerve in france , where the media has periodically pounced on the papon case as an example of the extent of nazi sympathy in france during the war .
members of the association of sons and daughters of deported jews of france protested in front of the justice palace to demonstrate their anger with a legal system that could give someone like papon a second chance to fight his conviction .

the alleged mastermind behind the march 11 train bombings in madrid had connections to germany , investigators said after " mohammed the egyptian " was arrested in italy earlier this week . rabei osman ahmed , known as " mohammed the egyptian , " was known to german intelligence services before he allegedly staged the madrid bombings which killed 191 people .
the 32-year old suspect , who is being held in italy on charges of international terrorism , lived in germany for two years , federal prosecutors said on saturday .
ahmed " was in germany from 1999 until august 2001 , " said frauke scheuten , a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutors .
but , she told reporters , " there is no indication that he planned attacks or was involved in attacks from germany . "
the prosecutors office did not elaborate on details of how and exactly when ahmed arrived in the country , but the weekly news magazine focus said in its edition for monday that the egypt-born suspect entered germany illegally in april 1999 and stayed until authorities lost trace of him in august 2001 .
der spiegel magazine , also in this week 's edition , said ahmed had been arrested two months after entering germany without identification papers on a train bound for france .
he told investigators he was palestinian and requested political asylum .
focus said his application was denied and ahmed was kept in detention in saarbrücken , on the border to france , pending deportation , but officials were unable to establish his nationality .
both magazines said the man was released into a home for asylum seekers in the western town of lebach in september 2000 .
there he set up a prayer room and attracted attention for preaching hatred against jews and israel .
the reports said german police tried to track ahmed down after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks in the united states , but he had already left lebach a month earlier .
on sept .
19 , the asylum alerted state authorities that ahmed had n't been seen since aug .
29 .
from that point on , all trace of him was lost .
spanish authorities had eye on ahmed in early 2003 , intelligence services in the state of saarland , of which saarbrücken is the capital , told federal prosecutors they had been informed by spain that ahmed was under investigation on suspicion of supporting a terrorist organization , said focus .
the german federal prosecutor 's office , which handles terrorism cases , ordered criminal police in the saarland region to keep ahmed under watch and to monitor telephone calls in his apartment in lebach .
scheuten confirmed that federal prosecutors had been informed , but refused to give details .
" there were no clues that would have prompted us to open an investigation , " she said , stressing that investigators had no indications then of any attacks being planned .
european-wide investigation the march 11 railway bombings in madrid were blamed on islamic militants with possible links to al qaida .
spain wants to extradite ahmed , and has said the formal request should arrive in rome on monday .
the magistrate in charge of the case said ahmed was a member of the egyptian islamic jihad , a terrorist organization linked to osama bin laden 's al qaida .
fourteen people have so far been arrested and held in custody in connection with the bombings .
seven other suspects blew themselves up april 3 as police closed in on a supposed safe house in the madrid suburb of leganes .
authorities are still looking for or demanding the extradition of eight other suspects , including ahmed .
german prosecutors opened up their own investigation of ahmed this week on the basis of information provided by the italian authorities .
scheuten , who confirmed that fact , said " there are still no indications that the madrid attacks were planned from germany .
she also added that at the moment " no connection with the sept .
11 attacks is discernible . "
germany became a focus of terror investigations after the sept .

the alleged mastermind behind the march 11 train bombings in madrid had connections to germany , investigators said after " mohammed the egyptian " was arrested in italy earlier this week . rabei osman ahmed , known as " mohammed the egyptian , " was known to german intelligence services before he allegedly staged the madrid bombings which killed 191 people .
the 32-year old suspect , who is being held in italy on charges of international terrorism , lived in germany for two years , federal prosecutors said on saturday .
ahmed " was in germany from 1999 until august 2001 , " said frauke scheuten , a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutors .
but , she told reporters , " there is no indication that he planned attacks or was involved in attacks from germany . "
the prosecutors office did not elaborate on details of how and exactly when ahmed arrived in the country , but the weekly news magazine focus said in its edition for monday that the egypt-born suspect entered germany illegally in april 1999 and stayed until authorities lost trace of him in august 2001 .
der spiegel magazine , also in this week 's edition , said ahmed had been arrested two months after entering germany without identification papers on a train bound for france .
he told investigators he was palestinian and requested political asylum .
focus said his application was denied and ahmed was kept in detention in saarbrücken , on the border to france , pending deportation , but officials were unable to establish his nationality .
both magazines said the man was released into a home for asylum seekers in the western town of lebach in september 2000 .
there he set up a prayer room and attracted attention for preaching hatred against jews and israel .
the reports said german police tried to track ahmed down after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks in the united states , but he had already left lebach a month earlier .
on sept .
19 , the asylum alerted state authorities that ahmed had n't been seen since aug .
29 .
from that point on , all trace of him was lost .
spanish authorities had eye on ahmed in early 2003 , intelligence services in the state of saarland , of which saarbrücken is the capital , told federal prosecutors they had been informed by spain that ahmed was under investigation on suspicion of supporting a terrorist organization , said focus .
the german federal prosecutor 's office , which handles terrorism cases , ordered criminal police in the saarland region to keep ahmed under watch and to monitor telephone calls in his apartment in lebach .
scheuten confirmed that federal prosecutors had been informed , but refused to give details .
" there were no clues that would have prompted us to open an investigation , " she said , stressing that investigators had no indications then of any attacks being planned .
european-wide investigation the march 11 railway bombings in madrid were blamed on islamic militants with possible links to al qaida .
spain wants to extradite ahmed , and has said the formal request should arrive in rome on monday .
the magistrate in charge of the case said ahmed was a member of the egyptian islamic jihad , a terrorist organization linked to osama bin laden 's al qaida .
fourteen people have so far been arrested and held in custody in connection with the bombings .

their husbands may make a living from playing a game but for the wives of international soccer stars , life is more serious than that .
there are boutiques to visit , column inches to fill and their own careers to pursue . there is a popular saying that claims that behind every successful man stands a strong woman .
in the world of soccer , where the adulation of millions of fans and the temptations that come with untold riches can lead even the most resolute man astray , the women behind the stars have to be even stronger than those in less intense environments .
it helps when the woman in question has as high a profile as the man she supposedly stands behind .
and when it comes to high profile , one can not get any more high profile than the wife of the man who is undoubtedly the most famous soccer player of his generation .
victoria beckham was already famous in her own right when she snagged the attentions of husband-to-be david , the then fast rising star of the manchester united team .
as one fifth of british pop group the spice girls , posh had a number of hit records before young master beckham slipped a rock the size of gibraltar on her finger and popped the question in 1998 .
apparently showing much-hidden depths , vicky saw the potential and within five years , she 'd ditched the pop career in all but name and had gone full time as mrs. beckham .
it has proved to be a brilliant career move for everyone involved .
posh is more than meets the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victoria stands by her man .
victoria has also proved she 's more than the strangely pouting woman dangling from the arm of the world 's most famous footballer .
recent allegations of infidelity on his part resulted in a good slap from posh followed by a promise to stand by her man , showing mrs. becks to be a fair and forgiving wife who values her family life .
there 's a woman who knows what she wants and knows how to get it .
another euro 2004 star who can be satisfied that his missus is well occupied while he 's playing away from home will be sweden 's goalkeeper magnus hedman .
the scandinavian goalie is one half of his country 's " blonde and beautiful " celebrity partnership , sharing the marital bed with former playboy playmate , model and pop star magdalena graf , who is undoubtedly more famous than the celtic keeper in their native land .
while the blonde magnus will be facing the firepower of europe 's best strikers , beautiful magda , one of sweden 's most recognizable and desired stars , will be pursuing her latest venture - hitting the boutiques .
mags loves her bags mother-of-two mags , regularly voted one of the world 's sexiest footballer 's wives , is renowned for her ability to spend with abandon and allegedly once blew over € 3000 -lrb- $ 3680 -rrb- of hubby magnus ' casino winnings on two handbags .
hedman will be hoping to keep sweden in the tournament for as long as possible , given the amount of win bonuses which will be needed back home .
even if their careers fail to eclipse those of their husbands and partners , many soccer wives and girlfriends overshadow their men in terms of glamour and beauty , often begging the question : " what on earth does she see in him ? "
the supermodel and the goalie take supermodel linda evangelista for example .
a woman who famously said she would n't get out of bed for anything less than $ 10,000 a day , the leggy canadian spurned a number of hollywood suitors and plumped for the french international goalkeeper fabien barthez , a diminutive man of slight build , below average height and bald as a cue ball who looks more like a james bond villain than a professional footballer .
prone to bulging eyes and erratic behavior , one wonders what linda saw in him when she said " yes " at the altar .
the couple had a wild time while barthez was starring for as monaco , enjoying the sophisticated lifestyle of the principality , but began experiencing problems once he moved to less glamorous manchester to pull on the shirt of united . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer team told no sex before games lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 12.06.2004 europe 's carnival of soccer gets underway großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a carnival spirit has swept through portugal on the opening day of euro 2004 .
euro 2004 finally gets underway in portugal amid a sea of color and noise .
the host nation open the competition with the first match against the greeks in porto . when the whistle blows to start the soccer match between the hosts portugal and greece in the estádio do dragão in porto , it will signal the beginning of 23 days of excitement , tension , ecstasy and heartbreak as the 2004 european championships finally get underway .
the soccer showpiece opens with a ceremony which has so far been kept under wraps .
taking place 15 minutes before the kick-off of the opening game , the event will welcome the players and supporters from the 16 participating nations .
ana dias , who is responsible for organising the opening and closing ceremonies , gave a clue as to what could be expected , on the uefa website by saying : " after portugal discovered the world , it is time for the world to discover portugal at euro 2004 . "
that could indicate a nautical or exploration theme harking back to the golden days of discovery when portuguese sea farers like vasco da gama and ferdinand magellan led the european world in sea exploration during the fifteenth century .
whatever the main theme , dias has promised a display of color and music which will climax with the crowd joining the 700 performers in creating an ocean of people .
that will lead the way to the sixteen nations contesting for the right to hold the henri delauney trophy aloft on july 4 at the estádio da luz in lisbon and become the 2004 european champions .
it is a far cry from the four team tournament that heralded the introduction of the championships onto the international stage back in 1960 .
since that first championship in france , the number of participating nations has swelled the tournament to its current size , which was first introduced with the successful shared event in the netherlands and belgium in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans paint their faces in the colors of the greek and portuguese teams .
an ever changing concept the european championship finals have seen many changes in their 44 year history .
not only has the number of teams fighting it out been increased since its inception but its structure has also developed and the tournament has seen the introduction of new innovations in the game .
in 1968 the championships changed from its original knock-out formula , where a team would have just one game against an opponent to see who advanced to the next round , to the qualification groups that are still in place today , where four teams play each other once with the top two teams going through .
the tournament in england in 1996 saw the introduction of the " golden goal " rule , the first time the decider had been used in a major international tournament .
before when two teams were drawn after 90 minutes , they would have the whole extra-time period to win the game .
this time if the matches were deadlocked by the end of regulation time , the games would be decided by the first team to score the " golden goal " in that extra half an hour .
a fanfare for every game there will also be a new feature this year , although not one associated with the playing of the game itself .
for the first time in a uefa european championship , all of the matches , not just the opening one , will be preceded by a short welcome ceremony in the centre of the pitch , lasting three minutes .
this year 's tournament will see some of the greatest names in the history of the finals going head to head for the title of european champion .
the russians , who won the first ever championship and dominated the subsequent early tournaments of the sixties , return to the fray while the germans look to improve on their impressive record by stretching their lead as the team with the most championship wins to four .
a competition of tradition and innovation france , the current holders and first team to win the championships as world champions , will be looking to hang onto the trophy that carries the name of the countryman who envisaged and developed the concept of the finals after losing their world cup title in japan / korea two years ago .
if they do so , it will be les bleus third triumph at the finals after wins in 1984 and 2000 .

euro 2004 finally gets underway in portugal amid a sea of color and noise .
the host nation open the competition with the first match against the greeks in porto . when the whistle blows to start the soccer match between the hosts portugal and greece in the estádio do dragão in porto , it will signal the beginning of 23 days of excitement , tension , ecstasy and heartbreak as the 2004 european championships finally get underway .
the soccer showpiece opens with a ceremony which has so far been kept under wraps .
taking place 15 minutes before the kick-off of the opening game , the event will welcome the players and supporters from the 16 participating nations .
ana dias , who is responsible for organising the opening and closing ceremonies , gave a clue as to what could be expected , on the uefa website by saying : " after portugal discovered the world , it is time for the world to discover portugal at euro 2004 . "
that could indicate a nautical or exploration theme harking back to the golden days of discovery when portuguese sea farers like vasco da gama and ferdinand magellan led the european world in sea exploration during the fifteenth century .
whatever the main theme , dias has promised a display of color and music which will climax with the crowd joining the 700 performers in creating an ocean of people .
that will lead the way to the sixteen nations contesting for the right to hold the henri delauney trophy aloft on july 4 at the estádio da luz in lisbon and become the 2004 european champions .
it is a far cry from the four team tournament that heralded the introduction of the championships onto the international stage back in 1960 .

not only has the number of teams fighting it out been increased since its inception but its structure has also developed and the tournament has seen the introduction of new innovations in the game .
in 1968 the championships changed from its original knock-out formula , where a team would have just one game against an opponent to see who advanced to the next round , to the qualification groups that are still in place today , where four teams play each other once with the top two teams going through .
the tournament in england in 1996 saw the introduction of the " golden goal " rule , the first time the decider had been used in a major international tournament .
before when two teams were drawn after 90 minutes , they would have the whole extra-time period to win the game .
this time if the matches were deadlocked by the end of regulation time , the games would be decided by the first team to score the " golden goal " in that extra half an hour .
a fanfare for every game there will also be a new feature this year , although not one associated with the playing of the game itself .
for the first time in a uefa european championship , all of the matches , not just the opening one , will be preceded by a short welcome ceremony in the centre of the pitch , lasting three minutes .
this year 's tournament will see some of the greatest names in the history of the finals going head to head for the title of european champion .
the russians , who won the first ever championship and dominated the subsequent early tournaments of the sixties , return to the fray while the germans look to improve on their impressive record by stretching their lead as the team with the most championship wins to four .
a competition of tradition and innovation france , the current holders and first team to win the championships as world champions , will be looking to hang onto the trophy that carries the name of the countryman who envisaged and developed the concept of the finals after losing their world cup title in japan / korea two years ago .

ana dias , who is responsible for organising the opening and closing ceremonies , gave a clue as to what could be expected , on the uefa website by saying : " after portugal discovered the world , it is time for the world to discover portugal at euro 2004 . "
that could indicate a nautical or exploration theme harking back to the golden days of discovery when portuguese sea farers like vasco da gama and ferdinand magellan led the european world in sea exploration during the fifteenth century .
whatever the main theme , dias has promised a display of color and music which will climax with the crowd joining the 700 performers in creating an ocean of people .
that will lead the way to the sixteen nations contesting for the right to hold the henri delauney trophy aloft on july 4 at the estádio da luz in lisbon and become the 2004 european champions .
it is a far cry from the four team tournament that heralded the introduction of the championships onto the international stage back in 1960 .
since that first championship in france , the number of participating nations has swelled the tournament to its current size , which was first introduced with the successful shared event in the netherlands and belgium in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans paint their faces in the colors of the greek and portuguese teams .
an ever changing concept the european championship finals have seen many changes in their 44 year history .
not only has the number of teams fighting it out been increased since its inception but its structure has also developed and the tournament has seen the introduction of new innovations in the game .
in 1968 the championships changed from its original knock-out formula , where a team would have just one game against an opponent to see who advanced to the next round , to the qualification groups that are still in place today , where four teams play each other once with the top two teams going through .
the tournament in england in 1996 saw the introduction of the " golden goal " rule , the first time the decider had been used in a major international tournament .
before when two teams were drawn after 90 minutes , they would have the whole extra-time period to win the game .
this time if the matches were deadlocked by the end of regulation time , the games would be decided by the first team to score the " golden goal " in that extra half an hour .
a fanfare for every game there will also be a new feature this year , although not one associated with the playing of the game itself .
for the first time in a uefa european championship , all of the matches , not just the opening one , will be preceded by a short welcome ceremony in the centre of the pitch , lasting three minutes .
this year 's tournament will see some of the greatest names in the history of the finals going head to head for the title of european champion .
the russians , who won the first ever championship and dominated the subsequent early tournaments of the sixties , return to the fray while the germans look to improve on their impressive record by stretching their lead as the team with the most championship wins to four .
a competition of tradition and innovation france , the current holders and first team to win the championships as world champions , will be looking to hang onto the trophy that carries the name of the countryman who envisaged and developed the concept of the finals after losing their world cup title in japan / korea two years ago .
if they do so , it will be les bleus third triumph at the finals after wins in 1984 and 2000 .
the inclusion of latvia this year will also have special significance .
although euro 2004 will be the baltic country 's third championship , it will be the first undertaken with official european union membership , secured during the recent accession at the beginning of may .
as a fully paid up member of the bloc , latvia will truly be a european contender , if only in name .
despite spirited performances in the 1996 and 2000 finals , it is unlikely that the latvians will progress to the latter stages of the competition .
those teams aside , there will be 13 other nations fielding a host of high-profile stars who will pound the portuguese turf in their country 's cause , bringing the continent 's major players together for a festival of football in the mediterranean sun .
global stars bring their skills to europe fans in the stadiums and at home will get the chance to see the likes of zinedine zidane and david beckham battle for midfield supremacy when france take on england ; watch open-mouthed as holland 's ruud van nistlerooy tests the goalkeeping skills of germany 's oliver kahn , and experience the riotous atmosphere between the neighbours when portugal 's christiano ronaldo bears down on spanish defender carles puyol .

their husbands may make a living from playing a game but for the wives of international soccer stars , life is more serious than that .
there are boutiques to visit , column inches to fill and their own careers to pursue . there is a popular saying that claims that behind every successful man stands a strong woman .
in the world of soccer , where the adulation of millions of fans and the temptations that come with untold riches can lead even the most resolute man astray , the women behind the stars have to be even stronger than those in less intense environments .
it helps when the woman in question has as high a profile as the man she supposedly stands behind .
and when it comes to high profile , one can not get any more high profile than the wife of the man who is undoubtedly the most famous soccer player of his generation .
victoria beckham was already famous in her own right when she snagged the attentions of husband-to-be david , the then fast rising star of the manchester united team .
as one fifth of british pop group the spice girls , posh had a number of hit records before young master beckham slipped a rock the size of gibraltar on her finger and popped the question in 1998 .
apparently showing much-hidden depths , vicky saw the potential and within five years , she 'd ditched the pop career in all but name and had gone full time as mrs. beckham .
it has proved to be a brilliant career move for everyone involved .
posh is more than meets the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victoria stands by her man .
victoria has also proved she 's more than the strangely pouting woman dangling from the arm of the world 's most famous footballer .
recent allegations of infidelity on his part resulted in a good slap from posh followed by a promise to stand by her man , showing mrs. becks to be a fair and forgiving wife who values her family life .
there 's a woman who knows what she wants and knows how to get it .
another euro 2004 star who can be satisfied that his missus is well occupied while he 's playing away from home will be sweden 's goalkeeper magnus hedman .
the scandinavian goalie is one half of his country 's " blonde and beautiful " celebrity partnership , sharing the marital bed with former playboy playmate , model and pop star magdalena graf , who is undoubtedly more famous than the celtic keeper in their native land .
while the blonde magnus will be facing the firepower of europe 's best strikers , beautiful magda , one of sweden 's most recognizable and desired stars , will be pursuing her latest venture - hitting the boutiques .
mags loves her bags mother-of-two mags , regularly voted one of the world 's sexiest footballer 's wives , is renowned for her ability to spend with abandon and allegedly once blew over € 3000 -lrb- $ 3680 -rrb- of hubby magnus ' casino winnings on two handbags .
hedman will be hoping to keep sweden in the tournament for as long as possible , given the amount of win bonuses which will be needed back home .
even if their careers fail to eclipse those of their husbands and partners , many soccer wives and girlfriends overshadow their men in terms of glamour and beauty , often begging the question : " what on earth does she see in him ? "
the supermodel and the goalie take supermodel linda evangelista for example .
a woman who famously said she would n't get out of bed for anything less than $ 10,000 a day , the leggy canadian spurned a number of hollywood suitors and plumped for the french international goalkeeper fabien barthez , a diminutive man of slight build , below average height and bald as a cue ball who looks more like a james bond villain than a professional footballer .
prone to bulging eyes and erratic behavior , one wonders what linda saw in him when she said " yes " at the altar .
the couple had a wild time while barthez was starring for as monaco , enjoying the sophisticated lifestyle of the principality , but began experiencing problems once he moved to less glamorous manchester to pull on the shirt of united . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer team told no sex before games lots of water is what german soccer players in portugal for euro 2004 need before their games , not hanky-panky , according to the team 's doctor .

she died at age 15 in a concentration camp , but her diary survived to tell the story that has shaped the world 's image of the holocaust .
on june 12 anne frank would have turned 75 . if her father had not published her diary after world war ii , anne frank would have simply been one among six million jews killed by the nazis .
but the publication of the now famous diary of anne frank lifted the young girl from the anonymous mass of victims and turned her into the face of the holocaust . first published in 1947 , the book has sold more than 25 million copies and has been translated into more than 50 languages .
in 1959 her story was turned into a three-time oscar winning film . anne 's account of the war years is now the subject of a japanese animation film as well as several plays and her diary is required reading in schools around the world .
the hiding place of the frank family , the present-day anne frank huis in amsterdam , is also the most-visited holocaust museum worldwide .
last year the museum registered a new visitor record with over 900,000 people . to coincide with anne 's 75th birthday on june 12 , the anne frank center in germany has released hitherto unpublished photographs from the frank family album shot by anne 's father otto frank . bildunterschrift : anne frank -lrb- left -rrb- stands with her sister margot on the beach in the netherlands in july 1938 . putting a face on the death of millions anne frank 's diary offers readers a glimpse into the mind and emotions of a young girl , shortly before she was packed off to a concentration camp . between 1942 and 1944 , anne confided her personal thoughts and problems to the orange-and-grey checked book , which she received as a gift on her 13th birthday .
the diary is a document of the desperate attempts at survival by a jewish family during nazi persecution . " it 's an individual fate that gave this horrible number of murdered people a face .
that has made anne frank a symbol , " says thomas heppener from the anne frank museum in amsterdam . in 1933 after hitler came to power , the franks fled to amsterdam where otto frank set up a company , which sold pectin used to make jelly and jams .
the family led a normal life until the tranquility ended abruptly in 1940 when germany occupied the netherlands and began implementing anti-jewish measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the family hid themselves in a couple of empty back rooms in otto frank 's office building .
while work continued as usual in the front room and storehouses , the franks lived quietly in the back together with another family .
a staircase connected the two buildings , the opening to which was camouflaged with a hinged bookcase which served as a door .
the families depended on several of ottofrank 's loyal employees to bring them food and keep their secret . anne and kitty it was during this time that the diary became anne 's best friend .
she named it kitty .
anne penned her thoughts and wishes in the diary and described the tensions and quarrels that erupted from a covert life in cramped quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an undated file photo of anne frank .
she also detailed nights filled with fear as bombs rained down on amsterdam or when strangers came to the office during the day and the franks had to stay absolutely still for hours in their hide-out . in august 1944 however the franks were betrayed .
it still remains unclear by whom .
what is known is that the ss , the elite nazi paramilitary corps stormed the hide-out and brought the franks to a labor camp in the netherlands .
some time later they were transported in cattle cars to auschwitz and later to bergen-belsen , germany . in march 1945 , just weeks before liberation , anne and her sister died of typhoid .
from the eight people who hid in the frank annex in amsterdam , only anne 's father survived the holocaust . controversy over diary 's authenticity though otto frank 's publication of anne 's diary in 1947 sparked much interest , it was n't long before skeptics raised their doubts over the authenticity of the document .
it took a few years before an authentic version was published . " before then passages that were anti-german had been cut out , " said nicolas berg from the leipzig-based simon dunow institute for german-jewish history .
according to berg , the passages were considered too provocative for post-war german readers . finally in 1981 , the dutch state issued an authentication certificate that laid all doubts to rest . comprehending the holocaust more than 50 years later , anne frank 's diary has n't lost its significance .
heppener said the diary " is also a document of a young girl 's adolescent problems . "
anne , who describes her discomfort over her maturing body and uncertainty about her first love , gives voice to emotions shared around the world .
" especially young women can identify strongly with her story because it throws up questions that are relevant even for teenagers today . " heppener believes that the identification with anne frank helps young people gain an introduction to the holocaust .
a young girl who dies in the face of the nazi death machine allows many to grasp the ghastly reality of the holocaust , he says . silke ballweg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : court revisits case of french nazi collaborator the case of a high french official convicted of nazi war crimes is active once again : a french court is reviewing the request for an appeal by maurice papon , unleashing anger in the jewish community .

" what i liked about reagan , " i heard her say to her friend , " was that he drew a line in the sand and said this is where i stand . "
the two women were waiting to file past ronald reagan 's coffin in the capitol .
in the two days that reagan lay in state in the us capitol rotunda , 200,000 people had been expected to pay their respects , most of them reagan supporters .
the millions of americans who did not do so well under his presidency largely stayed at home .
bush embraces reagan talking to those who did turn out elicited many different memories , but underlying them all was a common theme : they all said reagan was a strong leader .
they loved the way he turned the face of america away from the gloom of vietnam and watergate and pushed her towards a more hopeful horizon .
they loved his defiance of the soviet union , his willingness to stand up to labour unions .
of course , the reality was much less clear cut , but these are the distillations of his presidency which linger on today : reagan as a man with clear convictions , the ability to communicate them and an absolute confidence that things would turn out right in the end .
reagan 's self-assurance was so intense that it often made his opponents seem weak and vacillating .
if all this sounds familiar , then that 's exactly what george bush 's advisers are hoping for .
the bush campaign website briefly became a ronald reagan memorial the comparisons between the two men are striking and widely noted .
they both faced a threat of terrorism in the middle east .
they both implemented swingeing tax cuts , precipitating a vertiginous budget deficit .
they both wore religion on their sleeve and saw the world in moral terms .
the bush re-election campaign clearly believes these comparisons will help their candidate .
during the week mourning the death of ronald reagan , the front page of the bush / cheney website carried a giant picture of reagan with his top 10 speeches .
there was no picture of mr bush .
the bush campaign had no choice but to embrace the legacy - if they had stinted in any way there would have been uproar in the republican party - but it is not at all clear that it will do them much good .
unkind comparisons indeed , the bush team faces a very real danger .
the tidal wave of reagan memories - his smiling image , his greatest hits , the feel-good associations - may end up overwhelming george w bush to the point where the candidate is diminished not enhanced .
the president 's biggest problem is that he is no ronald reagan , to paraphrase lloyd bentsen 's famous put-down of dan quayle .
can you imagine a website with george bush 's top 10 speeches ?
though denounced at the time as inflammatory , ronald reagan 's " evil empire " remains an undeniably influential phrase , whilst george bush 's " axis of evil " already seems like a cheap rip-off with no coherent logic .
mr reagan won over democrats , but mr bush is loathed by the opposition there are more references to reagan 's phrase than those of mr bush on his own website .
ronald reagan was astonishingly successful at reaching out to democrats - so successful that they created a political subgroup all of their own : reagan democrats .
george bush , however , is loathed by democrats .
helped by a lot of democrats , ronald reagan won his elections with clear - even thumping - majorities ; george bush actually lost the popular vote .
and since then , in democrats ' minds , he has reneged on his promise to be a " uniter not a divider " .
however illusory or insubstantial it may have been , reagan 's folksy cheerfulness did help to restore americans ' sense of self-confidence .
but even the most avid bushies would be pushed to say the same about their candidate .
america today is fragile , jittery and anxious .
opinion polls after reagan 's death seemed to show that the reagan magic has not rubbed off on bush .
a los angeles poll conducted the week of the funeral shows the gap between bush and his opponent john kerry continuing to widen , with mr kerry leading by seven points .
out in front of the capitol , more than one republican said to me with a sigh : " i wish we had a ronald reagan today . "
when the election comes around , mr bush might be well advised not to overdo the comparisons .

the two women were waiting to file past ronald reagan 's coffin in the capitol .
in the two days that reagan lay in state in the us capitol rotunda , 200,000 people had been expected to pay their respects , most of them reagan supporters .
the millions of americans who did not do so well under his presidency largely stayed at home .
bush embraces reagan talking to those who did turn out elicited many different memories , but underlying them all was a common theme : they all said reagan was a strong leader .
they loved the way he turned the face of america away from the gloom of vietnam and watergate and pushed her towards a more hopeful horizon .
they loved his defiance of the soviet union , his willingness to stand up to labour unions .
of course , the reality was much less clear cut , but these are the distillations of his presidency which linger on today : reagan as a man with clear convictions , the ability to communicate them and an absolute confidence that things would turn out right in the end .
reagan 's self-assurance was so intense that it often made his opponents seem weak and vacillating .
if all this sounds familiar , then that 's exactly what george bush 's advisers are hoping for .
the bush campaign website briefly became a ronald reagan memorial the comparisons between the two men are striking and widely noted .
they both faced a threat of terrorism in the middle east .
they both implemented swingeing tax cuts , precipitating a vertiginous budget deficit .
they both wore religion on their sleeve and saw the world in moral terms .
the bush re-election campaign clearly believes these comparisons will help their candidate .
during the week mourning the death of ronald reagan , the front page of the bush / cheney website carried a giant picture of reagan with his top 10 speeches .
there was no picture of mr bush .
the bush campaign had no choice but to embrace the legacy - if they had stinted in any way there would have been uproar in the republican party - but it is not at all clear that it will do them much good .
unkind comparisons indeed , the bush team faces a very real danger .
the tidal wave of reagan memories - his smiling image , his greatest hits , the feel-good associations - may end up overwhelming george w bush to the point where the candidate is diminished not enhanced .
the president 's biggest problem is that he is no ronald reagan , to paraphrase lloyd bentsen 's famous put-down of dan quayle .
can you imagine a website with george bush 's top 10 speeches ?
though denounced at the time as inflammatory , ronald reagan 's " evil empire " remains an undeniably influential phrase , whilst george bush 's " axis of evil " already seems like a cheap rip-off with no coherent logic .
mr reagan won over democrats , but mr bush is loathed by the opposition there are more references to reagan 's phrase than those of mr bush on his own website .
ronald reagan was astonishingly successful at reaching out to democrats - so successful that they created a political subgroup all of their own : reagan democrats .
george bush , however , is loathed by democrats .
helped by a lot of democrats , ronald reagan won his elections with clear - even thumping - majorities ; george bush actually lost the popular vote .
and since then , in democrats ' minds , he has reneged on his promise to be a " uniter not a divider " .
however illusory or insubstantial it may have been , reagan 's folksy cheerfulness did help to restore americans ' sense of self-confidence .
but even the most avid bushies would be pushed to say the same about their candidate .
america today is fragile , jittery and anxious .
opinion polls after reagan 's death seemed to show that the reagan magic has not rubbed off on bush .
a los angeles poll conducted the week of the funeral shows the gap between bush and his opponent john kerry continuing to widen , with mr kerry leading by seven points .
out in front of the capitol , more than one republican said to me with a sigh : " i wish we had a ronald reagan today . "
when the election comes around , mr bush might be well advised not to overdo the comparisons .

by daniel lak bbc news , washington dc opinion is divided on reagan 's political legacy almost every mourner i met or heard from over the week of mourning for ronald reagan - every ordinary american , if you will - said the same thing .
they wanted to be part of history .
that was why they came to the centre of washington dc in sweltering heat to stand in long queues for a 20-second viewing of the ex-president 's casket .
it was why they lined constitution avenue at the heart of the capital to glimpse the funeral procession go by , and why they spent so much time watching television montages of reagan 's life .
it was all about being part of history .
" ronald reagan was a historical figure , " said lisa from baltimore , lining up to get into the rotunda of the capitol building , where the casket lay in state .
" this is history in the making . "
her view of what constitutes " history " is somewhat different from those who more traditionally determine such things .
what consensus there was concerns reagan 's ability to convince ordinary americans he was one of them to lisa , and to almost everyone else i spoke to on the topic over the past week , history means something significant that happens during one 's lifetime .
not a seminal event from a text book .
in that sense then , ronald reagan 's place in history is assured .
his public thinks so .
therefore it is true .
with the rose-coloured glasses that we all wear to look back upon our lives and times , the 1980s were an era of optimism and american foreign policy successes .
reagan was in power in then .
ergo , he is an historical figure .
but there is still that more traditional version of history , the compendium of the opinions and analysis of historians and commentators .
and they are not even close to agreeing on history 's view of the 40th president of the united states of america .
sceptics much of it comes down to which side of the political spectrum one calls home .
leftists contest almost every notion put forward by reagan 's supporters on the right .
ended the cold war ?
no , he was lucky to have the reluctant communist , mikhail gorbachev , as his opposite number in the soviet union .
laid the foundations for an economic boom ?
that was a natural consequence of the business cycle , say sceptics , and its effects fell largely upon those already well off .
reagan in his own words made america feel good about itself after the malaise of the carter years ?
only in retrospect , and only among those who already supported the reagan administration , again according to those on the opposite side of the argument .
there was little in the newspaper columns during the week of mourning that suggests an end to this divide .
what consensus there was concerns reagan 's ability to communicate , to convince ordinary americans that he is one of them , just a hometown boy made good .
in the end , that may turn out to be ronald reagan 's place in history .
whether they put his craggy visage on mount rushmore , or on the $ 10 bill , he will be remembered as a likeable human being who brought a light touch and humour to the affairs of state .
i asked 21-year-old lisa what she thought made mr reagan 's place in history .

that counts for a lot in america .

by daniel lak bbc news , washington dc opinion is divided on reagan 's political legacy almost every mourner i met or heard from over the week of mourning for ronald reagan - every ordinary american , if you will - said the same thing .
they wanted to be part of history .
that was why they came to the centre of washington dc in sweltering heat to stand in long queues for a 20-second viewing of the ex-president 's casket .
it was why they lined constitution avenue at the heart of the capital to glimpse the funeral procession go by , and why they spent so much time watching television montages of reagan 's life .
it was all about being part of history .
" ronald reagan was a historical figure , " said lisa from baltimore , lining up to get into the rotunda of the capitol building , where the casket lay in state .
" this is history in the making . "
her view of what constitutes " history " is somewhat different from those who more traditionally determine such things .
what consensus there was concerns reagan 's ability to convince ordinary americans he was one of them to lisa , and to almost everyone else i spoke to on the topic over the past week , history means something significant that happens during one 's lifetime .
not a seminal event from a text book .
in that sense then , ronald reagan 's place in history is assured .
his public thinks so .
therefore it is true .
with the rose-coloured glasses that we all wear to look back upon our lives and times , the 1980s were an era of optimism and american foreign policy successes .
reagan was in power in then .
ergo , he is an historical figure .
but there is still that more traditional version of history , the compendium of the opinions and analysis of historians and commentators .
and they are not even close to agreeing on history 's view of the 40th president of the united states of america .
sceptics much of it comes down to which side of the political spectrum one calls home .
leftists contest almost every notion put forward by reagan 's supporters on the right .
ended the cold war ?
no , he was lucky to have the reluctant communist , mikhail gorbachev , as his opposite number in the soviet union .
laid the foundations for an economic boom ?
