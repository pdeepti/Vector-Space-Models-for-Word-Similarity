singles in germany can forget moping around at home all by themselves .
new wallpapers and music cds have recently hit the market , designed to make them forget their loneliness . living alone can be a real drag .
then again , so can having a roommate .
they leave dishes in the sink , play earsplitting music and they always seem to want to watch the wrong tv programs .
two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .
they 're always there with a friendly smile , but minus the unpleasant side-effects of actually having to share an apartment with a real person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete priscilla imagine a friendly-looking guy or an amiable woman - someone who could be your best friend - plastered on your wall for as long as you want .
life-size and life-like , the wallpaper people are printed on large sheets of paper set against jazzy and even sexy backdrops . they pose relaxed and cool , quietly contemplating with a glass of wine in hand , joining you in an armchair as you both stare at the boob tube or noshing on pasta in an act of gastronomic solidarity .
just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .
germany ’ s federal statistical office estimates there are close to 14 million singles in germany .
indeed , the explosive growth of singles households has spawned an entire industry catering exclusively to them .
2001 saw the first-ever industrial fair " single world " aimed at the home-aloner in germany .
offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .
from the stereo to the wall but all these gadgets and appliances only add to the feeling of being home alone .
schmidt and baum aimed to do something to counteract that loneliness .
" we thought we could visualize the ' never alone again ' cd onto wallpaper , " schmidt explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete christine schmidt and baum found their models in cafes and among their own friends .
" we just went up to likeable normal singles we observed in cafes and on the subway , " schmidt recalled .
" it was important that they weren ’ t perfect or too good looking otherwise the wallpaper would have looked like a glossy billboard , " she added .
the feel-good mate the stick-it-on flat mates come at a price - € 160- € 260 for three to five sheets .
still , offers have been pouring in from as far away as south africa and the united states .

as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .
but if you look closely enough , you suddenly see life . angela kappler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wattenmeer nationalpark the wadden sea national park website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .

everyone would have their own miniature nuclear reactor in the basement .
fast breeder nuclear reactors would multiply the world 's uranium provisions . those were the nuclear strategists ' visions .
the reality - several decades later - looks pitiful .
what remains of the radiant future are radiant reactor ruins , radiant plutonium waste and radiant liquid waste from nuclear reprocessing plants such as france 's la hague or britain 's sellafield . in medicine , admittedly , nuclear technology is indispensable .
but radiation therapy has n't been able to beat cancer . echoing the atomic era the promises of the genetic engineering industry today are reminiscent of the messianic messages of the nuclear era : conserve the environment by making insecticides , pesticides and herbicides unnecessary .
on top of everything else , genetically modified crops are supposed to put an end to world hunger . every new technology offers new opportunities .
that 's no less the case with genetic engineering .
gm bacteria already produce insulin , a great aid to millions of people stricken with diabetes .
in the past , thousands of cows and pigs had to be slaughtered to extract marginal amounts of insulin from their pancreases . but every new technology involves risks , and that applies just as well to genetic engineering .
so-called antibiotic-resistant genetic markers , for example , are built into half of the gm plants approved worldwide .
they allow genetic engineers to differentiate between manipulated and natural plants . what will happen when these plants are consumed by people and animals in large quantities ?
more and more people are resistant to antibiotics .
scientists blame it on the lax use of antibiotics in the medical field and in fattening up animals for sale .
if consumption of gm crops increases , drug-resistance could grow . killing the weed killer theoretically , pesticides , insecticides and herbicides could be dispensed with , since plants could be made resistant to pests .
but experience shows that gm companies frequently employ the technology to make the plants resistant to weed killer rather than to weeds .
the result is that crops must be sprayed even more , just as monsanto 's roundup ready corn has shown .
the corn is sold as a package together with the corresponding herbicide , roundup . environmentalists fear that the greatest risk is the uncontrolled proliferation of gm crops .
the long range effects of the large-scale cultivation of gm crops remain unclear .

it 's easy to debunk , since starvation is n't caused by a worldwide lack of food .

two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”
with the government , public insurance agencies and doctors failing to establish such a list before ushering in the reforms on jan .
1 , officials have a bit of catch-up work to do .
again , schmidt promised this would also be resolved soon . ilka sax eckes , the government representative in charge of the affairs for people with disabilities in north rhine-westphalia , where leonhard lives , said the situation was a temporary “ transitional problem . ”
handicapped persons won ’ t have to pay more than € 71 per year , she claims , and special exceptions will be made to cover transportation costs for those incapable of getting to medical facilities on their own .
still , critics say that for some on social assistance , even that is too much . schmidt promises changes , cdu says ' not without us ' the questions that emerged in the report on monday night over the plight of the handicapped and chronically ill are just the latest in a series of criticisms germany ’ s health minister has faced since the start of the year . also part of the debate : what types of co-payments , if any , should be required for emergency medical attention and whether or not women should pay a co-payment when they visit their doctor for the sole purpose of getting a refill prescription for birth-control pills .
those decisions must all be made by the public health funds and doctors ' associations .

such a process could unravel the compromise reached by the cdu and governing coalition of greens and democrats , he said . the package of reforms , which was approved by the german parliament in september , is aimed at reducing germany 's non-wage labor costs , which are thought to contribute to the weak economy , and cut € 20 billion from the soaring health care costs . in the meantime , patients like leonhard continue to wait in the wings , worried about their future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .

two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”

those decisions must all be made by the public health funds and doctors ' associations .
the government merely sets the framework , schmidt said . the health minister ’ s seeming willingness to debate some aspects of the healthcare reform package and , possibly , make changes , has worried some in the opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . in the german mass circulation bild , andreas storm , a member of the cdu ’ s parliamentary faction , warned schmidt against promising any changes without discussing them with the cdu first .
such a process could unravel the compromise reached by the cdu and governing coalition of greens and democrats , he said . the package of reforms , which was approved by the german parliament in september , is aimed at reducing germany 's non-wage labor costs , which are thought to contribute to the weak economy , and cut € 20 billion from the soaring health care costs . in the meantime , patients like leonhard continue to wait in the wings , worried about their future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.01.2004 opinion : gm food wo n't solve our problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetically modified corn may not be all its cracked up to be germany 's agriculture and consumer affairs minister presented a bill monday that would clear the way for genetically modified food .
but the issue is loaded with the promise , opportunities and risks of new technologies . the solution to energy problems ; electricity in abundance for everyone ; medical wonders in the fight against cancer - the nuclear industry promised us a radiant future in the 1950s and 60s . ships , trains and cars would run as if magically driven by the atom 's elementary power .
everyone would have their own miniature nuclear reactor in the basement .
fast breeder nuclear reactors would multiply the world 's uranium provisions . those were the nuclear strategists ' visions .
the reality - several decades later - looks pitiful .
what remains of the radiant future are radiant reactor ruins , radiant plutonium waste and radiant liquid waste from nuclear reprocessing plants such as france 's la hague or britain 's sellafield . in medicine , admittedly , nuclear technology is indispensable .
but radiation therapy has n't been able to beat cancer . echoing the atomic era the promises of the genetic engineering industry today are reminiscent of the messianic messages of the nuclear era : conserve the environment by making insecticides , pesticides and herbicides unnecessary .
on top of everything else , genetically modified crops are supposed to put an end to world hunger . every new technology offers new opportunities .
that 's no less the case with genetic engineering .
gm bacteria already produce insulin , a great aid to millions of people stricken with diabetes .
in the past , thousands of cows and pigs had to be slaughtered to extract marginal amounts of insulin from their pancreases . but every new technology involves risks , and that applies just as well to genetic engineering .
so-called antibiotic-resistant genetic markers , for example , are built into half of the gm plants approved worldwide .
they allow genetic engineers to differentiate between manipulated and natural plants . what will happen when these plants are consumed by people and animals in large quantities ?
more and more people are resistant to antibiotics .
scientists blame it on the lax use of antibiotics in the medical field and in fattening up animals for sale .
if consumption of gm crops increases , drug-resistance could grow . killing the weed killer theoretically , pesticides , insecticides and herbicides could be dispensed with , since plants could be made resistant to pests .
but experience shows that gm companies frequently employ the technology to make the plants resistant to weed killer rather than to weeds .
the result is that crops must be sprayed even more , just as monsanto 's roundup ready corn has shown .
the corn is sold as a package together with the corresponding herbicide , roundup . environmentalists fear that the greatest risk is the uncontrolled proliferation of gm crops .
the long range effects of the large-scale cultivation of gm crops remain unclear .
pollen carried by bees or the wind , for example , can mingle with other natural plants .
the € 50,000 -lrb- $ 63,860 -rrb- fine for contaminating another farmer 's harvest that german agriculture minister renate künast uses as a threat in the law she presented monday to regulate gm crops certainly wo n't prevent the bees or the wind from disseminating pollen . gm crops wo n't stop famine but the greatest fiction is that genetic engineering will put an end to world hunger .
it 's easy to debunk , since starvation is n't caused by a worldwide lack of food .
instead , the problem is that so many people have too little money to afford food . famines usually develop because people lack purchasing power , that is , they do n't have money - whether due to wars , totalitarian intervention in the economic system or just because they do n't have the opportunity for reasonable development . genetic engineering wo n't change this fundamental problem .
indeed , it will make the problem even worse since seeds will become more expensive as genetic engineering firms attempt to recoup their immense development costs . it is time to realistically examine the opportunities and risks of genetic engineering .
we do n't need another technology like nuclear power that offers us a radiant future , but in the long run leaves us dealing with radiant waste . johannes beck -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to greenlight gm food labeling carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops .

singles in germany can forget moping around at home all by themselves .
new wallpapers and music cds have recently hit the market , designed to make them forget their loneliness . living alone can be a real drag .
then again , so can having a roommate .
they leave dishes in the sink , play earsplitting music and they always seem to want to watch the wrong tv programs .
two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .
they 're always there with a friendly smile , but minus the unpleasant side-effects of actually having to share an apartment with a real person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete priscilla imagine a friendly-looking guy or an amiable woman - someone who could be your best friend - plastered on your wall for as long as you want .
life-size and life-like , the wallpaper people are printed on large sheets of paper set against jazzy and even sexy backdrops . they pose relaxed and cool , quietly contemplating with a glass of wine in hand , joining you in an armchair as you both stare at the boob tube or noshing on pasta in an act of gastronomic solidarity .
just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .
germany ’ s federal statistical office estimates there are close to 14 million singles in germany .
indeed , the explosive growth of singles households has spawned an entire industry catering exclusively to them .
2001 saw the first-ever industrial fair " single world " aimed at the home-aloner in germany .
offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .
from the stereo to the wall but all these gadgets and appliances only add to the feeling of being home alone .
schmidt and baum aimed to do something to counteract that loneliness .
" we thought we could visualize the ' never alone again ' cd onto wallpaper , " schmidt explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete christine schmidt and baum found their models in cafes and among their own friends .
" we just went up to likeable normal singles we observed in cafes and on the subway , " schmidt recalled .
" it was important that they weren ’ t perfect or too good looking otherwise the wallpaper would have looked like a glossy billboard , " she added .
the feel-good mate the stick-it-on flat mates come at a price - € 160- € 260 for three to five sheets .
still , offers have been pouring in from as far away as south africa and the united states .
if you ’ ve got the money to pony up and you ’ re looking for a flat mate who ’ s " always friendly , doesn ’ t smoke , watches ‘ when harry met sally ’ for the 100th time with you , doesn ’ t leave his socks lying around , doesn ’ t argue and always remains fresh and attractive " as the single wallpaper web site proclaims , you know where to find one .
and schmidt says the trend is picking up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.01.2004 germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are handicapped social welfare recipients being short-changed by the reform ?
two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”
with the government , public insurance agencies and doctors failing to establish such a list before ushering in the reforms on jan .
1 , officials have a bit of catch-up work to do .
again , schmidt promised this would also be resolved soon . ilka sax eckes , the government representative in charge of the affairs for people with disabilities in north rhine-westphalia , where leonhard lives , said the situation was a temporary “ transitional problem . ”
handicapped persons won ’ t have to pay more than € 71 per year , she claims , and special exceptions will be made to cover transportation costs for those incapable of getting to medical facilities on their own .
still , critics say that for some on social assistance , even that is too much . schmidt promises changes , cdu says ' not without us ' the questions that emerged in the report on monday night over the plight of the handicapped and chronically ill are just the latest in a series of criticisms germany ’ s health minister has faced since the start of the year . also part of the debate : what types of co-payments , if any , should be required for emergency medical attention and whether or not women should pay a co-payment when they visit their doctor for the sole purpose of getting a refill prescription for birth-control pills .
those decisions must all be made by the public health funds and doctors ' associations .
the government merely sets the framework , schmidt said . the health minister ’ s seeming willingness to debate some aspects of the healthcare reform package and , possibly , make changes , has worried some in the opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . in the german mass circulation bild , andreas storm , a member of the cdu ’ s parliamentary faction , warned schmidt against promising any changes without discussing them with the cdu first .
such a process could unravel the compromise reached by the cdu and governing coalition of greens and democrats , he said . the package of reforms , which was approved by the german parliament in september , is aimed at reducing germany 's non-wage labor costs , which are thought to contribute to the weak economy , and cut € 20 billion from the soaring health care costs . in the meantime , patients like leonhard continue to wait in the wings , worried about their future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .

the bill is meant to establish a framework for farmers who want to grow gm crops as well as to ensure that consumers will be able to choose whether they want to buy the foods , which have generated considerable controversy and debate across europe . " we have come to an agreement , " agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the law will be passed by the cabinet in february . " the draft requires that all gm foods must be clearly labelled .
but consumers could still be left in the dark if the genetically modified elements can no longer be detected - as could be the case in animals that have been fed gm foods . counter to the social democrats ' original intentions , the law is not intended to promote biotechnology , green minister künast stressed .
genetic engineering could only be encouraged as long as " consumer protection , ethical values , the principle of provisions and the environmental aspects " were born in mind she told the newspaper . gm foods for fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , minister for consumer protection , food and agriculture " i reckon that , at the latest , genetically modified corn will appear on european supermarket shelves in the autumn , " künast said .
the european union , not the individual countries , is responsible for authorizing gm products for sale among member states .
künast said she expected the eu to approve a gm corn variety for sale for the first time in the summer . the new legislation comes in response to a european parliament law passed in july that effectively lifted a five-year moratorium on the sale of gm foods in europe as long as they are properaly labelled . wide-spread skepticism künast emphasized that she does n't see a necessity for gm food , adding that german businesses are skeptical about selling the products . so far , there is no scientific evidence that genetically modified foods are dangerous to people 's health .
but that has done little to close a gap in thinking between americans and europeans over bio-engineered crops and food . gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe . the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gm food wo n't solve our problems germany 's agriculture and consumer affairs minister presented a bill monday that would clear the way for genetically modified food .

two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”
with the government , public insurance agencies and doctors failing to establish such a list before ushering in the reforms on jan .
1 , officials have a bit of catch-up work to do .
again , schmidt promised this would also be resolved soon . ilka sax eckes , the government representative in charge of the affairs for people with disabilities in north rhine-westphalia , where leonhard lives , said the situation was a temporary “ transitional problem . ”
handicapped persons won ’ t have to pay more than € 71 per year , she claims , and special exceptions will be made to cover transportation costs for those incapable of getting to medical facilities on their own .
still , critics say that for some on social assistance , even that is too much . schmidt promises changes , cdu says ' not without us ' the questions that emerged in the report on monday night over the plight of the handicapped and chronically ill are just the latest in a series of criticisms germany ’ s health minister has faced since the start of the year . also part of the debate : what types of co-payments , if any , should be required for emergency medical attention and whether or not women should pay a co-payment when they visit their doctor for the sole purpose of getting a refill prescription for birth-control pills .

such a process could unravel the compromise reached by the cdu and governing coalition of greens and democrats , he said . the package of reforms , which was approved by the german parliament in september , is aimed at reducing germany 's non-wage labor costs , which are thought to contribute to the weak economy , and cut € 20 billion from the soaring health care costs . in the meantime , patients like leonhard continue to wait in the wings , worried about their future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .

singles in germany can forget moping around at home all by themselves .
new wallpapers and music cds have recently hit the market , designed to make them forget their loneliness . living alone can be a real drag .
then again , so can having a roommate .
they leave dishes in the sink , play earsplitting music and they always seem to want to watch the wrong tv programs .
two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .
they 're always there with a friendly smile , but minus the unpleasant side-effects of actually having to share an apartment with a real person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete priscilla imagine a friendly-looking guy or an amiable woman - someone who could be your best friend - plastered on your wall for as long as you want .
life-size and life-like , the wallpaper people are printed on large sheets of paper set against jazzy and even sexy backdrops . they pose relaxed and cool , quietly contemplating with a glass of wine in hand , joining you in an armchair as you both stare at the boob tube or noshing on pasta in an act of gastronomic solidarity .
just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .
germany ’ s federal statistical office estimates there are close to 14 million singles in germany .
indeed , the explosive growth of singles households has spawned an entire industry catering exclusively to them .
2001 saw the first-ever industrial fair " single world " aimed at the home-aloner in germany .
offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .
from the stereo to the wall but all these gadgets and appliances only add to the feeling of being home alone .
schmidt and baum aimed to do something to counteract that loneliness .
" we thought we could visualize the ' never alone again ' cd onto wallpaper , " schmidt explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete christine schmidt and baum found their models in cafes and among their own friends .
" we just went up to likeable normal singles we observed in cafes and on the subway , " schmidt recalled .
" it was important that they weren ’ t perfect or too good looking otherwise the wallpaper would have looked like a glossy billboard , " she added .
the feel-good mate the stick-it-on flat mates come at a price - € 160- € 260 for three to five sheets .
still , offers have been pouring in from as far away as south africa and the united states .
if you ’ ve got the money to pony up and you ’ re looking for a flat mate who ’ s " always friendly , doesn ’ t smoke , watches ‘ when harry met sally ’ for the 100th time with you , doesn ’ t leave his socks lying around , doesn ’ t argue and always remains fresh and attractive " as the single wallpaper web site proclaims , you know where to find one .
and schmidt says the trend is picking up .
" it 's incredible how many people have latched on to this , " she says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de single in the city ? - look online the number of single people in germany is climbing , but finding that perfect partner seems harder than ever .

the bill is meant to establish a framework for farmers who want to grow gm crops as well as to ensure that consumers will be able to choose whether they want to buy the foods , which have generated considerable controversy and debate across europe . " we have come to an agreement , " agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast told the berliner zeitung newspaper .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .

singles in germany can forget moping around at home all by themselves .
new wallpapers and music cds have recently hit the market , designed to make them forget their loneliness . living alone can be a real drag .
then again , so can having a roommate .
they leave dishes in the sink , play earsplitting music and they always seem to want to watch the wrong tv programs .
two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .
they 're always there with a friendly smile , but minus the unpleasant side-effects of actually having to share an apartment with a real person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete priscilla imagine a friendly-looking guy or an amiable woman - someone who could be your best friend - plastered on your wall for as long as you want .
life-size and life-like , the wallpaper people are printed on large sheets of paper set against jazzy and even sexy backdrops . they pose relaxed and cool , quietly contemplating with a glass of wine in hand , joining you in an armchair as you both stare at the boob tube or noshing on pasta in an act of gastronomic solidarity .
just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .
germany ’ s federal statistical office estimates there are close to 14 million singles in germany .
indeed , the explosive growth of singles households has spawned an entire industry catering exclusively to them .
2001 saw the first-ever industrial fair " single world " aimed at the home-aloner in germany .
offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .
from the stereo to the wall but all these gadgets and appliances only add to the feeling of being home alone .
schmidt and baum aimed to do something to counteract that loneliness .
" we thought we could visualize the ' never alone again ' cd onto wallpaper , " schmidt explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete christine schmidt and baum found their models in cafes and among their own friends .
" we just went up to likeable normal singles we observed in cafes and on the subway , " schmidt recalled .
" it was important that they weren ’ t perfect or too good looking otherwise the wallpaper would have looked like a glossy billboard , " she added .
the feel-good mate the stick-it-on flat mates come at a price - € 160- € 260 for three to five sheets .
still , offers have been pouring in from as far away as south africa and the united states .
if you ’ ve got the money to pony up and you ’ re looking for a flat mate who ’ s " always friendly , doesn ’ t smoke , watches ‘ when harry met sally ’ for the 100th time with you , doesn ’ t leave his socks lying around , doesn ’ t argue and always remains fresh and attractive " as the single wallpaper web site proclaims , you know where to find one .
and schmidt says the trend is picking up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.01.2004 germany to greenlight gm food labeling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn could be approved for sale in the european union this summer carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops . after months of wrangling , the federal government has reached a consensus on a genetic engineering law that will allow gm food to be grown and sold in germany .
the bill is meant to establish a framework for farmers who want to grow gm crops as well as to ensure that consumers will be able to choose whether they want to buy the foods , which have generated considerable controversy and debate across europe . " we have come to an agreement , " agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the law will be passed by the cabinet in february . " the draft requires that all gm foods must be clearly labelled .
but consumers could still be left in the dark if the genetically modified elements can no longer be detected - as could be the case in animals that have been fed gm foods . counter to the social democrats ' original intentions , the law is not intended to promote biotechnology , green minister künast stressed .
genetic engineering could only be encouraged as long as " consumer protection , ethical values , the principle of provisions and the environmental aspects " were born in mind she told the newspaper . gm foods for fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , minister for consumer protection , food and agriculture " i reckon that , at the latest , genetically modified corn will appear on european supermarket shelves in the autumn , " künast said .
the european union , not the individual countries , is responsible for authorizing gm products for sale among member states .
künast said she expected the eu to approve a gm corn variety for sale for the first time in the summer . the new legislation comes in response to a european parliament law passed in july that effectively lifted a five-year moratorium on the sale of gm foods in europe as long as they are properaly labelled . wide-spread skepticism künast emphasized that she does n't see a necessity for gm food , adding that german businesses are skeptical about selling the products . so far , there is no scientific evidence that genetically modified foods are dangerous to people 's health .
but that has done little to close a gap in thinking between americans and europeans over bio-engineered crops and food . gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe . the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gm food wo n't solve our problems germany 's agriculture and consumer affairs minister presented a bill monday that would clear the way for genetically modified food .

the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .

to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .

the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.01.2004 germany to greenlight gm food labeling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn could be approved for sale in the european union this summer carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops . after months of wrangling , the federal government has reached a consensus on a genetic engineering law that will allow gm food to be grown and sold in germany .
the bill is meant to establish a framework for farmers who want to grow gm crops as well as to ensure that consumers will be able to choose whether they want to buy the foods , which have generated considerable controversy and debate across europe . " we have come to an agreement , " agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the law will be passed by the cabinet in february . " the draft requires that all gm foods must be clearly labelled .
but consumers could still be left in the dark if the genetically modified elements can no longer be detected - as could be the case in animals that have been fed gm foods . counter to the social democrats ' original intentions , the law is not intended to promote biotechnology , green minister künast stressed .
genetic engineering could only be encouraged as long as " consumer protection , ethical values , the principle of provisions and the environmental aspects " were born in mind she told the newspaper . gm foods for fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , minister for consumer protection , food and agriculture " i reckon that , at the latest , genetically modified corn will appear on european supermarket shelves in the autumn , " künast said .
the european union , not the individual countries , is responsible for authorizing gm products for sale among member states .
künast said she expected the eu to approve a gm corn variety for sale for the first time in the summer . the new legislation comes in response to a european parliament law passed in july that effectively lifted a five-year moratorium on the sale of gm foods in europe as long as they are properaly labelled . wide-spread skepticism künast emphasized that she does n't see a necessity for gm food , adding that german businesses are skeptical about selling the products . so far , there is no scientific evidence that genetically modified foods are dangerous to people 's health .
but that has done little to close a gap in thinking between americans and europeans over bio-engineered crops and food . gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe . the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gm food wo n't solve our problems germany 's agriculture and consumer affairs minister presented a bill monday that would clear the way for genetically modified food .

the bill is meant to establish a framework for farmers who want to grow gm crops as well as to ensure that consumers will be able to choose whether they want to buy the foods , which have generated considerable controversy and debate across europe . " we have come to an agreement , " agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the law will be passed by the cabinet in february . " the draft requires that all gm foods must be clearly labelled .
but consumers could still be left in the dark if the genetically modified elements can no longer be detected - as could be the case in animals that have been fed gm foods . counter to the social democrats ' original intentions , the law is not intended to promote biotechnology , green minister künast stressed .
genetic engineering could only be encouraged as long as " consumer protection , ethical values , the principle of provisions and the environmental aspects " were born in mind she told the newspaper . gm foods for fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , minister for consumer protection , food and agriculture " i reckon that , at the latest , genetically modified corn will appear on european supermarket shelves in the autumn , " künast said .
the european union , not the individual countries , is responsible for authorizing gm products for sale among member states .
künast said she expected the eu to approve a gm corn variety for sale for the first time in the summer . the new legislation comes in response to a european parliament law passed in july that effectively lifted a five-year moratorium on the sale of gm foods in europe as long as they are properaly labelled . wide-spread skepticism künast emphasized that she does n't see a necessity for gm food , adding that german businesses are skeptical about selling the products . so far , there is no scientific evidence that genetically modified foods are dangerous to people 's health .
but that has done little to close a gap in thinking between americans and europeans over bio-engineered crops and food . gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe . the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gm food wo n't solve our problems germany 's agriculture and consumer affairs minister presented a bill monday that would clear the way for genetically modified food .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.01.2004 opinion : gm food wo n't solve our problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetically modified corn may not be all its cracked up to be germany 's agriculture and consumer affairs minister presented a bill monday that would clear the way for genetically modified food .
but the issue is loaded with the promise , opportunities and risks of new technologies . the solution to energy problems ; electricity in abundance for everyone ; medical wonders in the fight against cancer - the nuclear industry promised us a radiant future in the 1950s and 60s . ships , trains and cars would run as if magically driven by the atom 's elementary power .
everyone would have their own miniature nuclear reactor in the basement .
fast breeder nuclear reactors would multiply the world 's uranium provisions . those were the nuclear strategists ' visions .
the reality - several decades later - looks pitiful .
what remains of the radiant future are radiant reactor ruins , radiant plutonium waste and radiant liquid waste from nuclear reprocessing plants such as france 's la hague or britain 's sellafield . in medicine , admittedly , nuclear technology is indispensable .
but radiation therapy has n't been able to beat cancer . echoing the atomic era the promises of the genetic engineering industry today are reminiscent of the messianic messages of the nuclear era : conserve the environment by making insecticides , pesticides and herbicides unnecessary .
on top of everything else , genetically modified crops are supposed to put an end to world hunger . every new technology offers new opportunities .
that 's no less the case with genetic engineering .
gm bacteria already produce insulin , a great aid to millions of people stricken with diabetes .
in the past , thousands of cows and pigs had to be slaughtered to extract marginal amounts of insulin from their pancreases . but every new technology involves risks , and that applies just as well to genetic engineering .
so-called antibiotic-resistant genetic markers , for example , are built into half of the gm plants approved worldwide .
they allow genetic engineers to differentiate between manipulated and natural plants . what will happen when these plants are consumed by people and animals in large quantities ?
more and more people are resistant to antibiotics .
scientists blame it on the lax use of antibiotics in the medical field and in fattening up animals for sale .
if consumption of gm crops increases , drug-resistance could grow . killing the weed killer theoretically , pesticides , insecticides and herbicides could be dispensed with , since plants could be made resistant to pests .
but experience shows that gm companies frequently employ the technology to make the plants resistant to weed killer rather than to weeds .
the result is that crops must be sprayed even more , just as monsanto 's roundup ready corn has shown .
the corn is sold as a package together with the corresponding herbicide , roundup . environmentalists fear that the greatest risk is the uncontrolled proliferation of gm crops .
the long range effects of the large-scale cultivation of gm crops remain unclear .
pollen carried by bees or the wind , for example , can mingle with other natural plants .
the € 50,000 -lrb- $ 63,860 -rrb- fine for contaminating another farmer 's harvest that german agriculture minister renate künast uses as a threat in the law she presented monday to regulate gm crops certainly wo n't prevent the bees or the wind from disseminating pollen . gm crops wo n't stop famine but the greatest fiction is that genetic engineering will put an end to world hunger .
it 's easy to debunk , since starvation is n't caused by a worldwide lack of food .
instead , the problem is that so many people have too little money to afford food . famines usually develop because people lack purchasing power , that is , they do n't have money - whether due to wars , totalitarian intervention in the economic system or just because they do n't have the opportunity for reasonable development . genetic engineering wo n't change this fundamental problem .
indeed , it will make the problem even worse since seeds will become more expensive as genetic engineering firms attempt to recoup their immense development costs . it is time to realistically examine the opportunities and risks of genetic engineering .
we do n't need another technology like nuclear power that offers us a radiant future , but in the long run leaves us dealing with radiant waste . johannes beck -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to greenlight gm food labeling carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "
heyne is optimistic that the success of the fishing industry and the growth of tourism will make the people of upperlusatia develop a new relationship to the environment they live in .

" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "
heyne is optimistic that the success of the fishing industry and the growth of tourism will make the people of upperlusatia develop a new relationship to the environment they live in .
the prouder they feel about the beautiful landscape around them , the more they ’ ll care about preserving it . mike mühlberger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape further information on the reserve 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- . dw-radio live living in germany listen live dw on demand video on demand audio on demand audio / video podcasting © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

singles in germany can forget moping around at home all by themselves .
new wallpapers and music cds have recently hit the market , designed to make them forget their loneliness . living alone can be a real drag .
then again , so can having a roommate .
they leave dishes in the sink , play earsplitting music and they always seem to want to watch the wrong tv programs .
two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .
they 're always there with a friendly smile , but minus the unpleasant side-effects of actually having to share an apartment with a real person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete priscilla imagine a friendly-looking guy or an amiable woman - someone who could be your best friend - plastered on your wall for as long as you want .
life-size and life-like , the wallpaper people are printed on large sheets of paper set against jazzy and even sexy backdrops . they pose relaxed and cool , quietly contemplating with a glass of wine in hand , joining you in an armchair as you both stare at the boob tube or noshing on pasta in an act of gastronomic solidarity .
just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .
germany ’ s federal statistical office estimates there are close to 14 million singles in germany .
indeed , the explosive growth of singles households has spawned an entire industry catering exclusively to them .
2001 saw the first-ever industrial fair " single world " aimed at the home-aloner in germany .
offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .
from the stereo to the wall but all these gadgets and appliances only add to the feeling of being home alone .
schmidt and baum aimed to do something to counteract that loneliness .
" we thought we could visualize the ' never alone again ' cd onto wallpaper , " schmidt explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete christine schmidt and baum found their models in cafes and among their own friends .
" we just went up to likeable normal singles we observed in cafes and on the subway , " schmidt recalled .
" it was important that they weren ’ t perfect or too good looking otherwise the wallpaper would have looked like a glossy billboard , " she added .
the feel-good mate the stick-it-on flat mates come at a price - € 160- € 260 for three to five sheets .
still , offers have been pouring in from as far away as south africa and the united states .
if you ’ ve got the money to pony up and you ’ re looking for a flat mate who ’ s " always friendly , doesn ’ t smoke , watches ‘ when harry met sally ’ for the 100th time with you , doesn ’ t leave his socks lying around , doesn ’ t argue and always remains fresh and attractive " as the single wallpaper web site proclaims , you know where to find one .
and schmidt says the trend is picking up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.01.2004 germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are handicapped social welfare recipients being short-changed by the reform ?
two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”

two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .

singles in germany can forget moping around at home all by themselves .
new wallpapers and music cds have recently hit the market , designed to make them forget their loneliness . living alone can be a real drag .
then again , so can having a roommate .
they leave dishes in the sink , play earsplitting music and they always seem to want to watch the wrong tv programs .
two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .
they 're always there with a friendly smile , but minus the unpleasant side-effects of actually having to share an apartment with a real person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete priscilla imagine a friendly-looking guy or an amiable woman - someone who could be your best friend - plastered on your wall for as long as you want .
life-size and life-like , the wallpaper people are printed on large sheets of paper set against jazzy and even sexy backdrops . they pose relaxed and cool , quietly contemplating with a glass of wine in hand , joining you in an armchair as you both stare at the boob tube or noshing on pasta in an act of gastronomic solidarity .
just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .
germany ’ s federal statistical office estimates there are close to 14 million singles in germany .
indeed , the explosive growth of singles households has spawned an entire industry catering exclusively to them .
2001 saw the first-ever industrial fair " single world " aimed at the home-aloner in germany .
offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .
from the stereo to the wall but all these gadgets and appliances only add to the feeling of being home alone .
schmidt and baum aimed to do something to counteract that loneliness .
" we thought we could visualize the ' never alone again ' cd onto wallpaper , " schmidt explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete christine schmidt and baum found their models in cafes and among their own friends .
" we just went up to likeable normal singles we observed in cafes and on the subway , " schmidt recalled .
" it was important that they weren ’ t perfect or too good looking otherwise the wallpaper would have looked like a glossy billboard , " she added .
the feel-good mate the stick-it-on flat mates come at a price - € 160- € 260 for three to five sheets .
still , offers have been pouring in from as far away as south africa and the united states .
if you ’ ve got the money to pony up and you ’ re looking for a flat mate who ’ s " always friendly , doesn ’ t smoke , watches ‘ when harry met sally ’ for the 100th time with you , doesn ’ t leave his socks lying around , doesn ’ t argue and always remains fresh and attractive " as the single wallpaper web site proclaims , you know where to find one .
and schmidt says the trend is picking up .

but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”
with the government , public insurance agencies and doctors failing to establish such a list before ushering in the reforms on jan .
1 , officials have a bit of catch-up work to do .
again , schmidt promised this would also be resolved soon . ilka sax eckes , the government representative in charge of the affairs for people with disabilities in north rhine-westphalia , where leonhard lives , said the situation was a temporary “ transitional problem . ”
handicapped persons won ’ t have to pay more than € 71 per year , she claims , and special exceptions will be made to cover transportation costs for those incapable of getting to medical facilities on their own .
still , critics say that for some on social assistance , even that is too much . schmidt promises changes , cdu says ' not without us ' the questions that emerged in the report on monday night over the plight of the handicapped and chronically ill are just the latest in a series of criticisms germany ’ s health minister has faced since the start of the year . also part of the debate : what types of co-payments , if any , should be required for emergency medical attention and whether or not women should pay a co-payment when they visit their doctor for the sole purpose of getting a refill prescription for birth-control pills .
those decisions must all be made by the public health funds and doctors ' associations .
the government merely sets the framework , schmidt said . the health minister ’ s seeming willingness to debate some aspects of the healthcare reform package and , possibly , make changes , has worried some in the opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . in the german mass circulation bild , andreas storm , a member of the cdu ’ s parliamentary faction , warned schmidt against promising any changes without discussing them with the cdu first .
such a process could unravel the compromise reached by the cdu and governing coalition of greens and democrats , he said . the package of reforms , which was approved by the german parliament in september , is aimed at reducing germany 's non-wage labor costs , which are thought to contribute to the weak economy , and cut € 20 billion from the soaring health care costs . in the meantime , patients like leonhard continue to wait in the wings , worried about their future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "
heyne is optimistic that the success of the fishing industry and the growth of tourism will make the people of upperlusatia develop a new relationship to the environment they live in .
the prouder they feel about the beautiful landscape around them , the more they ’ ll care about preserving it . mike mühlberger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape further information on the reserve 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .
but if you look closely enough , you suddenly see life . angela kappler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wattenmeer nationalpark the wadden sea national park website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

a plan to set up a biosphere reserve is often met with skepticism by local communities .
dw-radio spoke with the german federal agency for nature conservation about this problem . there are many advantages to a biosphere reserve .
yet it is particularly important to consider local people and their economies , especially in developing countries , when setting up such an area . there are many potential benefits for such groups , such as the protection of basic land and water resources , additional employment , an opportunity to maintain existing traditions and lifestyles , as well as a more healthy environment . but when a biosphere reserve is first established , the local populations are not always enthusiastic , as they need to alter their way of life and are no longer able to use certain areas as they please . dw-radio ’ s john hay talked with jürgen nauber , head of the division of international affairs and co-operation with germany ’ s federal agency for nature conservation , which hosts germany 's committee for the man and the biosphere program , and asked him how local communities tend to react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio ’ s award-winning environment magazine .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.01.2004 germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are handicapped social welfare recipients being short-changed by the reform ?
two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”
with the government , public insurance agencies and doctors failing to establish such a list before ushering in the reforms on jan .
1 , officials have a bit of catch-up work to do .
again , schmidt promised this would also be resolved soon . ilka sax eckes , the government representative in charge of the affairs for people with disabilities in north rhine-westphalia , where leonhard lives , said the situation was a temporary “ transitional problem . ”
handicapped persons won ’ t have to pay more than € 71 per year , she claims , and special exceptions will be made to cover transportation costs for those incapable of getting to medical facilities on their own .
still , critics say that for some on social assistance , even that is too much . schmidt promises changes , cdu says ' not without us ' the questions that emerged in the report on monday night over the plight of the handicapped and chronically ill are just the latest in a series of criticisms germany ’ s health minister has faced since the start of the year . also part of the debate : what types of co-payments , if any , should be required for emergency medical attention and whether or not women should pay a co-payment when they visit their doctor for the sole purpose of getting a refill prescription for birth-control pills .
those decisions must all be made by the public health funds and doctors ' associations .
the government merely sets the framework , schmidt said . the health minister ’ s seeming willingness to debate some aspects of the healthcare reform package and , possibly , make changes , has worried some in the opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . in the german mass circulation bild , andreas storm , a member of the cdu ’ s parliamentary faction , warned schmidt against promising any changes without discussing them with the cdu first .
such a process could unravel the compromise reached by the cdu and governing coalition of greens and democrats , he said . the package of reforms , which was approved by the german parliament in september , is aimed at reducing germany 's non-wage labor costs , which are thought to contribute to the weak economy , and cut € 20 billion from the soaring health care costs . in the meantime , patients like leonhard continue to wait in the wings , worried about their future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

künast said she expected the eu to approve a gm corn variety for sale for the first time in the summer . the new legislation comes in response to a european parliament law passed in july that effectively lifted a five-year moratorium on the sale of gm foods in europe as long as they are properaly labelled . wide-spread skepticism künast emphasized that she does n't see a necessity for gm food , adding that german businesses are skeptical about selling the products . so far , there is no scientific evidence that genetically modified foods are dangerous to people 's health .
but that has done little to close a gap in thinking between americans and europeans over bio-engineered crops and food . gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe . the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gm food wo n't solve our problems germany 's agriculture and consumer affairs minister presented a bill monday that would clear the way for genetically modified food .

new wallpapers and music cds have recently hit the market , designed to make them forget their loneliness . living alone can be a real drag .
then again , so can having a roommate .
they leave dishes in the sink , play earsplitting music and they always seem to want to watch the wrong tv programs .
two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .
they 're always there with a friendly smile , but minus the unpleasant side-effects of actually having to share an apartment with a real person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete priscilla imagine a friendly-looking guy or an amiable woman - someone who could be your best friend - plastered on your wall for as long as you want .
life-size and life-like , the wallpaper people are printed on large sheets of paper set against jazzy and even sexy backdrops . they pose relaxed and cool , quietly contemplating with a glass of wine in hand , joining you in an armchair as you both stare at the boob tube or noshing on pasta in an act of gastronomic solidarity .
just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .
germany ’ s federal statistical office estimates there are close to 14 million singles in germany .
indeed , the explosive growth of singles households has spawned an entire industry catering exclusively to them .
2001 saw the first-ever industrial fair " single world " aimed at the home-aloner in germany .
offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .
from the stereo to the wall but all these gadgets and appliances only add to the feeling of being home alone .
schmidt and baum aimed to do something to counteract that loneliness .
" we thought we could visualize the ' never alone again ' cd onto wallpaper , " schmidt explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete christine schmidt and baum found their models in cafes and among their own friends .
" we just went up to likeable normal singles we observed in cafes and on the subway , " schmidt recalled .
" it was important that they weren ’ t perfect or too good looking otherwise the wallpaper would have looked like a glossy billboard , " she added .
the feel-good mate the stick-it-on flat mates come at a price - € 160- € 260 for three to five sheets .
still , offers have been pouring in from as far away as south africa and the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.01.2004 germany to greenlight gm food labeling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn could be approved for sale in the european union this summer carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops . after months of wrangling , the federal government has reached a consensus on a genetic engineering law that will allow gm food to be grown and sold in germany .
the bill is meant to establish a framework for farmers who want to grow gm crops as well as to ensure that consumers will be able to choose whether they want to buy the foods , which have generated considerable controversy and debate across europe . " we have come to an agreement , " agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the law will be passed by the cabinet in february . " the draft requires that all gm foods must be clearly labelled .
but consumers could still be left in the dark if the genetically modified elements can no longer be detected - as could be the case in animals that have been fed gm foods . counter to the social democrats ' original intentions , the law is not intended to promote biotechnology , green minister künast stressed .
genetic engineering could only be encouraged as long as " consumer protection , ethical values , the principle of provisions and the environmental aspects " were born in mind she told the newspaper . gm foods for fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , minister for consumer protection , food and agriculture " i reckon that , at the latest , genetically modified corn will appear on european supermarket shelves in the autumn , " künast said .
the european union , not the individual countries , is responsible for authorizing gm products for sale among member states .
künast said she expected the eu to approve a gm corn variety for sale for the first time in the summer . the new legislation comes in response to a european parliament law passed in july that effectively lifted a five-year moratorium on the sale of gm foods in europe as long as they are properaly labelled . wide-spread skepticism künast emphasized that she does n't see a necessity for gm food , adding that german businesses are skeptical about selling the products . so far , there is no scientific evidence that genetically modified foods are dangerous to people 's health .
but that has done little to close a gap in thinking between americans and europeans over bio-engineered crops and food . gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe . the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gm food wo n't solve our problems germany 's agriculture and consumer affairs minister presented a bill monday that would clear the way for genetically modified food .

the bill is meant to establish a framework for farmers who want to grow gm crops as well as to ensure that consumers will be able to choose whether they want to buy the foods , which have generated considerable controversy and debate across europe . " we have come to an agreement , " agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast told the berliner zeitung newspaper .

" we talked about the development of the american and the global economy , and the relationship between the euro and the dollar , " schröder said after the meeting in berlin .
the german leader referred to the european central bank as the chief monetary authority for the 12-member euro zone and said it alone was responsible for taking action .
in a speech after the high profile photo-op in front of the chancellery , greenspan said the current u.s. account deficit was to blame for the slump in the dollar and added that federal reserve studies show that such " imbalances are likely to be adjusted well before they become destabilizing . "
but the ecb sees the current account deficit as a potential source of trouble for the world economy .
it has repeatedly appealed to washington to boost the dollar .
despite u.s. officials ’ claims to following a strong dollar policy , european market analysts think washington is unlikely to make efforts to counteract the greenback ’ s slide against the euro as long as the disparity continues to help american exporters in an election year . -lrb- based on wire reports -rrb- more briefs 13.01.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn reconsidering building projects 13.01.2004 -pipe- foreign cars sell well in germany 13.01.2004 -pipe- german economy shows signs of life 12.01.2004 -pipe- 20,000 fewer jobs in retail 12.01.2004 -pipe- airbus manufacturer hit by soaring euro 12.01.2004 -pipe- siemens sells off shares in infineon 09.01.2004 -pipe- survey sees further german job cuts 09.01.2004 -pipe- opel may reinstate pension plan radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .

a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .

it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.01.2004 germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are handicapped social welfare recipients being short-changed by the reform ?
two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”
with the government , public insurance agencies and doctors failing to establish such a list before ushering in the reforms on jan .
1 , officials have a bit of catch-up work to do .
again , schmidt promised this would also be resolved soon . ilka sax eckes , the government representative in charge of the affairs for people with disabilities in north rhine-westphalia , where leonhard lives , said the situation was a temporary “ transitional problem . ”
handicapped persons won ’ t have to pay more than € 71 per year , she claims , and special exceptions will be made to cover transportation costs for those incapable of getting to medical facilities on their own .

two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”
with the government , public insurance agencies and doctors failing to establish such a list before ushering in the reforms on jan .
1 , officials have a bit of catch-up work to do .
again , schmidt promised this would also be resolved soon . ilka sax eckes , the government representative in charge of the affairs for people with disabilities in north rhine-westphalia , where leonhard lives , said the situation was a temporary “ transitional problem . ”
handicapped persons won ’ t have to pay more than € 71 per year , she claims , and special exceptions will be made to cover transportation costs for those incapable of getting to medical facilities on their own .

two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”
with the government , public insurance agencies and doctors failing to establish such a list before ushering in the reforms on jan .
1 , officials have a bit of catch-up work to do .
again , schmidt promised this would also be resolved soon . ilka sax eckes , the government representative in charge of the affairs for people with disabilities in north rhine-westphalia , where leonhard lives , said the situation was a temporary “ transitional problem . ”
handicapped persons won ’ t have to pay more than € 71 per year , she claims , and special exceptions will be made to cover transportation costs for those incapable of getting to medical facilities on their own .
still , critics say that for some on social assistance , even that is too much . schmidt promises changes , cdu says ' not without us ' the questions that emerged in the report on monday night over the plight of the handicapped and chronically ill are just the latest in a series of criticisms germany ’ s health minister has faced since the start of the year . also part of the debate : what types of co-payments , if any , should be required for emergency medical attention and whether or not women should pay a co-payment when they visit their doctor for the sole purpose of getting a refill prescription for birth-control pills .

two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .

just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .
germany ’ s federal statistical office estimates there are close to 14 million singles in germany .
indeed , the explosive growth of singles households has spawned an entire industry catering exclusively to them .
2001 saw the first-ever industrial fair " single world " aimed at the home-aloner in germany .
offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .
from the stereo to the wall but all these gadgets and appliances only add to the feeling of being home alone .
schmidt and baum aimed to do something to counteract that loneliness .
" we thought we could visualize the ' never alone again ' cd onto wallpaper , " schmidt explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete christine schmidt and baum found their models in cafes and among their own friends .
" we just went up to likeable normal singles we observed in cafes and on the subway , " schmidt recalled .
" it was important that they weren ’ t perfect or too good looking otherwise the wallpaper would have looked like a glossy billboard , " she added .
the feel-good mate the stick-it-on flat mates come at a price - € 160- € 260 for three to five sheets .
still , offers have been pouring in from as far away as south africa and the united states .
if you ’ ve got the money to pony up and you ’ re looking for a flat mate who ’ s " always friendly , doesn ’ t smoke , watches ‘ when harry met sally ’ for the 100th time with you , doesn ’ t leave his socks lying around , doesn ’ t argue and always remains fresh and attractive " as the single wallpaper web site proclaims , you know where to find one .
and schmidt says the trend is picking up .

singles in germany can forget moping around at home all by themselves .
new wallpapers and music cds have recently hit the market , designed to make them forget their loneliness . living alone can be a real drag .
then again , so can having a roommate .
they leave dishes in the sink , play earsplitting music and they always seem to want to watch the wrong tv programs .
two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .
they 're always there with a friendly smile , but minus the unpleasant side-effects of actually having to share an apartment with a real person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete priscilla imagine a friendly-looking guy or an amiable woman - someone who could be your best friend - plastered on your wall for as long as you want .
life-size and life-like , the wallpaper people are printed on large sheets of paper set against jazzy and even sexy backdrops . they pose relaxed and cool , quietly contemplating with a glass of wine in hand , joining you in an armchair as you both stare at the boob tube or noshing on pasta in an act of gastronomic solidarity .
just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .
germany ’ s federal statistical office estimates there are close to 14 million singles in germany .
indeed , the explosive growth of singles households has spawned an entire industry catering exclusively to them .
2001 saw the first-ever industrial fair " single world " aimed at the home-aloner in germany .
offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .
from the stereo to the wall but all these gadgets and appliances only add to the feeling of being home alone .
schmidt and baum aimed to do something to counteract that loneliness .
" we thought we could visualize the ' never alone again ' cd onto wallpaper , " schmidt explained .

instead of the current 38.5-hour week , schily said the civil servants should start working 40 hours .
he also said the state should monitor early retirements and encourage civil servants to stick with the job until the official retirement age of 65 .
in addition , the minister suggested introducing incentive-based pay for its civil employees , which would mean a loosening of the current wage tariffs , a proposal the public service trade unions reject .
schily ’ s statements could hardly have been surprising for the country ’ s 1.2 million government and state employees who have come under criticism for receiving preferential treatment at a time when the rest of the economy has had to tighten its belt . more briefs 12.01.2004 -pipe- no more ‘ made in germany ’ labels ? 12.01.2004 -pipe- raf show curators abandon request for berlin funds 12.01.2004 -pipe- agriculture ministry admits knowledge of tip-off in bse testing lapses 09.01.2004 -pipe- germany says stell cell laws not hindering research 09.01.2004 -pipe- schröder supports leipzig 's olympic bid 09.01.2004 -pipe- hate mail for german health minister 07.01.2004 -pipe- mars orbiter fails to contact landing unit 07.01.2004 -pipe- german farmer groups slam sloppy bse testing radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on top of everything else , genetically modified crops are supposed to put an end to world hunger . every new technology offers new opportunities .
that 's no less the case with genetic engineering .
gm bacteria already produce insulin , a great aid to millions of people stricken with diabetes .
in the past , thousands of cows and pigs had to be slaughtered to extract marginal amounts of insulin from their pancreases . but every new technology involves risks , and that applies just as well to genetic engineering .

they allow genetic engineers to differentiate between manipulated and natural plants . what will happen when these plants are consumed by people and animals in large quantities ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.01.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc france threatens to build reactor without u.s. a groundbreaking international research project is in jeopardy after french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin threatened that europe could complete the project without american help .
raffarin said monday that europe could go it alone and build the world ’ s first nuclear fusion power station , despite europe being engaged in the 19-year-old international cooperation .
" we have to have iter -lsb- the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -rsb- , even if we do it ourselves , " raffarin said .
raffarin ’ s comments come as france appears to be losing the battle to host the plant , with washington recently announcing its support for japan ’ s bid .
his announcement could further complicate u.s.-french relations , which soured during the run up to the war in iraq .

speaking after a meeting of central bankers from the developed g10 countries in basel , trichet said that the excessive volatility in the exchange rate is " not welcome and not appropriate , " describing the dollar 's decline as " brutal . "
the strengthening of the euro against the dollar risks hampering euro zone growth and is increasing pressure in the ecb to cut interest rates .
trichet 's remarks , which are very strong compared to his previous more cautious comments , come after the euro was trading at $ 1.29 in early morning trading on monday .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .

but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "
heyne is optimistic that the success of the fishing industry and the growth of tourism will make the people of upperlusatia develop a new relationship to the environment they live in .
the prouder they feel about the beautiful landscape around them , the more they ’ ll care about preserving it . mike mühlberger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape further information on the reserve 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "
heyne is optimistic that the success of the fishing industry and the growth of tourism will make the people of upperlusatia develop a new relationship to the environment they live in .
the prouder they feel about the beautiful landscape around them , the more they ’ ll care about preserving it . mike mühlberger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape further information on the reserve 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .

" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .

protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .

the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .

a plan to set up a biosphere reserve is often met with skepticism by local communities .
dw-radio spoke with the german federal agency for nature conservation about this problem . there are many advantages to a biosphere reserve .
yet it is particularly important to consider local people and their economies , especially in developing countries , when setting up such an area . there are many potential benefits for such groups , such as the protection of basic land and water resources , additional employment , an opportunity to maintain existing traditions and lifestyles , as well as a more healthy environment . but when a biosphere reserve is first established , the local populations are not always enthusiastic , as they need to alter their way of life and are no longer able to use certain areas as they please . dw-radio ’ s john hay talked with jürgen nauber , head of the division of international affairs and co-operation with germany ’ s federal agency for nature conservation , which hosts germany 's committee for the man and the biosphere program , and asked him how local communities tend to react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio ’ s award-winning environment magazine .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization -lrb- unesco -rrb- launched its own park concept in 1970 : the “ man and the biosphere ” -lrb- mab -rrb- program .
today , biosphere reserves exist in 97 countries . human development is an important part of the unesco biosphere concept .
the reserves are designed to protect nature and , at the same time , allow human beings to live within the park limits and use the land in a controlled and sustainable fashion .
even intensive agriculture and industry are permitted in certain areas . biosphere reserves also serve scientific interests .
data collected by scientists can offer insight into global warming and the greenhouse effect , or into the way species evolve if left untouched .
because of this purpose , they are sometimes termed “ living laboratories . ”
biosphere reserves also have an educational aspect , since they function as role models for other reserves and often provide learning facilities , such as information centers . dw-radio looks at some of the most interesting biosphere reserves in germany in a special series produced in co-operation with unesco and the german federal agency for nature conservation . dw-world.de berchtesgaden : promoting sustainable development the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

dw-radio spoke with the german federal agency for nature conservation about this problem . there are many advantages to a biosphere reserve .
yet it is particularly important to consider local people and their economies , especially in developing countries , when setting up such an area . there are many potential benefits for such groups , such as the protection of basic land and water resources , additional employment , an opportunity to maintain existing traditions and lifestyles , as well as a more healthy environment . but when a biosphere reserve is first established , the local populations are not always enthusiastic , as they need to alter their way of life and are no longer able to use certain areas as they please . dw-radio ’ s john hay talked with jürgen nauber , head of the division of international affairs and co-operation with germany ’ s federal agency for nature conservation , which hosts germany 's committee for the man and the biosphere program , and asked him how local communities tend to react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio ’ s award-winning environment magazine .

“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "
heyne is optimistic that the success of the fishing industry and the growth of tourism will make the people of upperlusatia develop a new relationship to the environment they live in .
the prouder they feel about the beautiful landscape around them , the more they ’ ll care about preserving it . mike mühlberger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape further information on the reserve 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization -lrb- unesco -rrb- launched its own park concept in 1970 : the “ man and the biosphere ” -lrb- mab -rrb- program .
today , biosphere reserves exist in 97 countries . human development is an important part of the unesco biosphere concept .
the reserves are designed to protect nature and , at the same time , allow human beings to live within the park limits and use the land in a controlled and sustainable fashion .
even intensive agriculture and industry are permitted in certain areas . biosphere reserves also serve scientific interests .
data collected by scientists can offer insight into global warming and the greenhouse effect , or into the way species evolve if left untouched .
because of this purpose , they are sometimes termed “ living laboratories . ”
biosphere reserves also have an educational aspect , since they function as role models for other reserves and often provide learning facilities , such as information centers . dw-radio looks at some of the most interesting biosphere reserves in germany in a special series produced in co-operation with unesco and the german federal agency for nature conservation . dw-world.de berchtesgaden : promoting sustainable development the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .

singles in germany can forget moping around at home all by themselves .
new wallpapers and music cds have recently hit the market , designed to make them forget their loneliness . living alone can be a real drag .
then again , so can having a roommate .
they leave dishes in the sink , play earsplitting music and they always seem to want to watch the wrong tv programs .
two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .
they 're always there with a friendly smile , but minus the unpleasant side-effects of actually having to share an apartment with a real person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete priscilla imagine a friendly-looking guy or an amiable woman - someone who could be your best friend - plastered on your wall for as long as you want .
life-size and life-like , the wallpaper people are printed on large sheets of paper set against jazzy and even sexy backdrops . they pose relaxed and cool , quietly contemplating with a glass of wine in hand , joining you in an armchair as you both stare at the boob tube or noshing on pasta in an act of gastronomic solidarity .
just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .
germany ’ s federal statistical office estimates there are close to 14 million singles in germany .
indeed , the explosive growth of singles households has spawned an entire industry catering exclusively to them .
2001 saw the first-ever industrial fair " single world " aimed at the home-aloner in germany .
offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .
from the stereo to the wall but all these gadgets and appliances only add to the feeling of being home alone .
schmidt and baum aimed to do something to counteract that loneliness .
" we thought we could visualize the ' never alone again ' cd onto wallpaper , " schmidt explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete christine schmidt and baum found their models in cafes and among their own friends .
" we just went up to likeable normal singles we observed in cafes and on the subway , " schmidt recalled .
" it was important that they weren ’ t perfect or too good looking otherwise the wallpaper would have looked like a glossy billboard , " she added .
the feel-good mate the stick-it-on flat mates come at a price - € 160- € 260 for three to five sheets .
still , offers have been pouring in from as far away as south africa and the united states .
if you ’ ve got the money to pony up and you ’ re looking for a flat mate who ’ s " always friendly , doesn ’ t smoke , watches ‘ when harry met sally ’ for the 100th time with you , doesn ’ t leave his socks lying around , doesn ’ t argue and always remains fresh and attractive " as the single wallpaper web site proclaims , you know where to find one .
and schmidt says the trend is picking up .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.01.2004 opinion : gm food wo n't solve our problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetically modified corn may not be all its cracked up to be germany 's agriculture and consumer affairs minister presented a bill monday that would clear the way for genetically modified food .
but the issue is loaded with the promise , opportunities and risks of new technologies . the solution to energy problems ; electricity in abundance for everyone ; medical wonders in the fight against cancer - the nuclear industry promised us a radiant future in the 1950s and 60s . ships , trains and cars would run as if magically driven by the atom 's elementary power .
everyone would have their own miniature nuclear reactor in the basement .
fast breeder nuclear reactors would multiply the world 's uranium provisions . those were the nuclear strategists ' visions .
the reality - several decades later - looks pitiful .
what remains of the radiant future are radiant reactor ruins , radiant plutonium waste and radiant liquid waste from nuclear reprocessing plants such as france 's la hague or britain 's sellafield . in medicine , admittedly , nuclear technology is indispensable .
but radiation therapy has n't been able to beat cancer . echoing the atomic era the promises of the genetic engineering industry today are reminiscent of the messianic messages of the nuclear era : conserve the environment by making insecticides , pesticides and herbicides unnecessary .
on top of everything else , genetically modified crops are supposed to put an end to world hunger . every new technology offers new opportunities .
that 's no less the case with genetic engineering .
gm bacteria already produce insulin , a great aid to millions of people stricken with diabetes .
in the past , thousands of cows and pigs had to be slaughtered to extract marginal amounts of insulin from their pancreases . but every new technology involves risks , and that applies just as well to genetic engineering .
so-called antibiotic-resistant genetic markers , for example , are built into half of the gm plants approved worldwide .
they allow genetic engineers to differentiate between manipulated and natural plants . what will happen when these plants are consumed by people and animals in large quantities ?
more and more people are resistant to antibiotics .
scientists blame it on the lax use of antibiotics in the medical field and in fattening up animals for sale .
if consumption of gm crops increases , drug-resistance could grow . killing the weed killer theoretically , pesticides , insecticides and herbicides could be dispensed with , since plants could be made resistant to pests .
but experience shows that gm companies frequently employ the technology to make the plants resistant to weed killer rather than to weeds .
the result is that crops must be sprayed even more , just as monsanto 's roundup ready corn has shown .
the corn is sold as a package together with the corresponding herbicide , roundup . environmentalists fear that the greatest risk is the uncontrolled proliferation of gm crops .
the long range effects of the large-scale cultivation of gm crops remain unclear .
pollen carried by bees or the wind , for example , can mingle with other natural plants .
the € 50,000 -lrb- $ 63,860 -rrb- fine for contaminating another farmer 's harvest that german agriculture minister renate künast uses as a threat in the law she presented monday to regulate gm crops certainly wo n't prevent the bees or the wind from disseminating pollen . gm crops wo n't stop famine but the greatest fiction is that genetic engineering will put an end to world hunger .
it 's easy to debunk , since starvation is n't caused by a worldwide lack of food .
instead , the problem is that so many people have too little money to afford food . famines usually develop because people lack purchasing power , that is , they do n't have money - whether due to wars , totalitarian intervention in the economic system or just because they do n't have the opportunity for reasonable development . genetic engineering wo n't change this fundamental problem .
indeed , it will make the problem even worse since seeds will become more expensive as genetic engineering firms attempt to recoup their immense development costs . it is time to realistically examine the opportunities and risks of genetic engineering .
we do n't need another technology like nuclear power that offers us a radiant future , but in the long run leaves us dealing with radiant waste . johannes beck -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to greenlight gm food labeling carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.01.2004 germany to greenlight gm food labeling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn could be approved for sale in the european union this summer carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops . after months of wrangling , the federal government has reached a consensus on a genetic engineering law that will allow gm food to be grown and sold in germany .
the bill is meant to establish a framework for farmers who want to grow gm crops as well as to ensure that consumers will be able to choose whether they want to buy the foods , which have generated considerable controversy and debate across europe . " we have come to an agreement , " agriculture and consumer affairs minister renate künast told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
" the law will be passed by the cabinet in february . " the draft requires that all gm foods must be clearly labelled .
but consumers could still be left in the dark if the genetically modified elements can no longer be detected - as could be the case in animals that have been fed gm foods . counter to the social democrats ' original intentions , the law is not intended to promote biotechnology , green minister künast stressed .
genetic engineering could only be encouraged as long as " consumer protection , ethical values , the principle of provisions and the environmental aspects " were born in mind she told the newspaper . gm foods for fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , minister for consumer protection , food and agriculture " i reckon that , at the latest , genetically modified corn will appear on european supermarket shelves in the autumn , " künast said .
the european union , not the individual countries , is responsible for authorizing gm products for sale among member states .
künast said she expected the eu to approve a gm corn variety for sale for the first time in the summer . the new legislation comes in response to a european parliament law passed in july that effectively lifted a five-year moratorium on the sale of gm foods in europe as long as they are properaly labelled . wide-spread skepticism künast emphasized that she does n't see a necessity for gm food , adding that german businesses are skeptical about selling the products . so far , there is no scientific evidence that genetically modified foods are dangerous to people 's health .
but that has done little to close a gap in thinking between americans and europeans over bio-engineered crops and food . gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe . the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gm food wo n't solve our problems germany 's agriculture and consumer affairs minister presented a bill monday that would clear the way for genetically modified food .

singles in germany can forget moping around at home all by themselves .
new wallpapers and music cds have recently hit the market , designed to make them forget their loneliness . living alone can be a real drag .
then again , so can having a roommate .
they leave dishes in the sink , play earsplitting music and they always seem to want to watch the wrong tv programs .
two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .
they 're always there with a friendly smile , but minus the unpleasant side-effects of actually having to share an apartment with a real person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete priscilla imagine a friendly-looking guy or an amiable woman - someone who could be your best friend - plastered on your wall for as long as you want .
life-size and life-like , the wallpaper people are printed on large sheets of paper set against jazzy and even sexy backdrops . they pose relaxed and cool , quietly contemplating with a glass of wine in hand , joining you in an armchair as you both stare at the boob tube or noshing on pasta in an act of gastronomic solidarity .
just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "
heyne is optimistic that the success of the fishing industry and the growth of tourism will make the people of upperlusatia develop a new relationship to the environment they live in .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "

singles in germany can forget moping around at home all by themselves .
new wallpapers and music cds have recently hit the market , designed to make them forget their loneliness . living alone can be a real drag .
then again , so can having a roommate .
they leave dishes in the sink , play earsplitting music and they always seem to want to watch the wrong tv programs .
two young german interior designers think they 've come up with the perfect solution : two-dimensional wallpaper roommates .
they 're always there with a friendly smile , but minus the unpleasant side-effects of actually having to share an apartment with a real person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete priscilla imagine a friendly-looking guy or an amiable woman - someone who could be your best friend - plastered on your wall for as long as you want .
life-size and life-like , the wallpaper people are printed on large sheets of paper set against jazzy and even sexy backdrops . they pose relaxed and cool , quietly contemplating with a glass of wine in hand , joining you in an armchair as you both stare at the boob tube or noshing on pasta in an act of gastronomic solidarity .
just unroll two or three sheets of the paper , stick them up on the wall , and presto , you have a good-natured , good-looking flat mate to come home to , said susanne schmidt , 34 , who came up with the concept .
imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .
germany ’ s federal statistical office estimates there are close to 14 million singles in germany .
indeed , the explosive growth of singles households has spawned an entire industry catering exclusively to them .
2001 saw the first-ever industrial fair " single world " aimed at the home-aloner in germany .
offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .
from the stereo to the wall but all these gadgets and appliances only add to the feeling of being home alone .
schmidt and baum aimed to do something to counteract that loneliness .
" we thought we could visualize the ' never alone again ' cd onto wallpaper , " schmidt explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single tapete christine schmidt and baum found their models in cafes and among their own friends .
" we just went up to likeable normal singles we observed in cafes and on the subway , " schmidt recalled .
" it was important that they weren ’ t perfect or too good looking otherwise the wallpaper would have looked like a glossy billboard , " she added .
the feel-good mate the stick-it-on flat mates come at a price - € 160- € 260 for three to five sheets .
still , offers have been pouring in from as far away as south africa and the united states .
if you ’ ve got the money to pony up and you ’ re looking for a flat mate who ’ s " always friendly , doesn ’ t smoke , watches ‘ when harry met sally ’ for the 100th time with you , doesn ’ t leave his socks lying around , doesn ’ t argue and always remains fresh and attractive " as the single wallpaper web site proclaims , you know where to find one .
and schmidt says the trend is picking up .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "
heyne is optimistic that the success of the fishing industry and the growth of tourism will make the people of upperlusatia develop a new relationship to the environment they live in .
the prouder they feel about the beautiful landscape around them , the more they ’ ll care about preserving it . mike mühlberger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape further information on the reserve 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization -lrb- unesco -rrb- launched its own park concept in 1970 : the “ man and the biosphere ” -lrb- mab -rrb- program .
today , biosphere reserves exist in 97 countries . human development is an important part of the unesco biosphere concept .
the reserves are designed to protect nature and , at the same time , allow human beings to live within the park limits and use the land in a controlled and sustainable fashion .
even intensive agriculture and industry are permitted in certain areas . biosphere reserves also serve scientific interests .
data collected by scientists can offer insight into global warming and the greenhouse effect , or into the way species evolve if left untouched .
because of this purpose , they are sometimes termed “ living laboratories . ”
biosphere reserves also have an educational aspect , since they function as role models for other reserves and often provide learning facilities , such as information centers . dw-radio looks at some of the most interesting biosphere reserves in germany in a special series produced in co-operation with unesco and the german federal agency for nature conservation . dw-world.de berchtesgaden : promoting sustainable development the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .
but if you look closely enough , you suddenly see life . angela kappler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wattenmeer nationalpark the wadden sea national park website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.01.2004 germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are handicapped social welfare recipients being short-changed by the reform ?
two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”
with the government , public insurance agencies and doctors failing to establish such a list before ushering in the reforms on jan .
1 , officials have a bit of catch-up work to do .
again , schmidt promised this would also be resolved soon . ilka sax eckes , the government representative in charge of the affairs for people with disabilities in north rhine-westphalia , where leonhard lives , said the situation was a temporary “ transitional problem . ”
handicapped persons won ’ t have to pay more than € 71 per year , she claims , and special exceptions will be made to cover transportation costs for those incapable of getting to medical facilities on their own .
still , critics say that for some on social assistance , even that is too much . schmidt promises changes , cdu says ' not without us ' the questions that emerged in the report on monday night over the plight of the handicapped and chronically ill are just the latest in a series of criticisms germany ’ s health minister has faced since the start of the year . also part of the debate : what types of co-payments , if any , should be required for emergency medical attention and whether or not women should pay a co-payment when they visit their doctor for the sole purpose of getting a refill prescription for birth-control pills .
those decisions must all be made by the public health funds and doctors ' associations .
the government merely sets the framework , schmidt said . the health minister ’ s seeming willingness to debate some aspects of the healthcare reform package and , possibly , make changes , has worried some in the opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . in the german mass circulation bild , andreas storm , a member of the cdu ’ s parliamentary faction , warned schmidt against promising any changes without discussing them with the cdu first .
such a process could unravel the compromise reached by the cdu and governing coalition of greens and democrats , he said . the package of reforms , which was approved by the german parliament in september , is aimed at reducing germany 's non-wage labor costs , which are thought to contribute to the weak economy , and cut € 20 billion from the soaring health care costs . in the meantime , patients like leonhard continue to wait in the wings , worried about their future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .

the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization -lrb- unesco -rrb- launched its own park concept in 1970 : the “ man and the biosphere ” -lrb- mab -rrb- program .
today , biosphere reserves exist in 97 countries . human development is an important part of the unesco biosphere concept .
the reserves are designed to protect nature and , at the same time , allow human beings to live within the park limits and use the land in a controlled and sustainable fashion .
even intensive agriculture and industry are permitted in certain areas . biosphere reserves also serve scientific interests .
data collected by scientists can offer insight into global warming and the greenhouse effect , or into the way species evolve if left untouched .
because of this purpose , they are sometimes termed “ living laboratories . ”
biosphere reserves also have an educational aspect , since they function as role models for other reserves and often provide learning facilities , such as information centers . dw-radio looks at some of the most interesting biosphere reserves in germany in a special series produced in co-operation with unesco and the german federal agency for nature conservation . dw-world.de berchtesgaden : promoting sustainable development the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world .
schorfheide-chorin : environmental protection and economic development the biosphere reserve schorfheide-chorin is located in the scarcely populated area of the former east germany known as the uckermark .
it ’ s a region blessed with natural beauty , but plagued by high unemployment .
the bavarian forest : a story of regeneration the bark beetle has destroyed vast areas of the bavarian forest biosphere reserve .
this destruction and officials ’ decision not to intervene has attracted international attention .
but the forest is slowly regenerating .
rügen : preserving traditions and nature rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , due to its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions .
interview : integrating people into the biosphere a plan to set up a biosphere reserve is often met with skepticism by local communities .
dw-radio spoke with the german federal agency for nature conservation about this problem .
upperlusatia : fishing into the future the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve .

two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”
with the government , public insurance agencies and doctors failing to establish such a list before ushering in the reforms on jan .

such a process could unravel the compromise reached by the cdu and governing coalition of greens and democrats , he said . the package of reforms , which was approved by the german parliament in september , is aimed at reducing germany 's non-wage labor costs , which are thought to contribute to the weak economy , and cut € 20 billion from the soaring health care costs . in the meantime , patients like leonhard continue to wait in the wings , worried about their future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .

two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization -lrb- unesco -rrb- launched its own park concept in 1970 : the “ man and the biosphere ” -lrb- mab -rrb- program .
today , biosphere reserves exist in 97 countries . human development is an important part of the unesco biosphere concept .
the reserves are designed to protect nature and , at the same time , allow human beings to live within the park limits and use the land in a controlled and sustainable fashion .
even intensive agriculture and industry are permitted in certain areas . biosphere reserves also serve scientific interests .
data collected by scientists can offer insight into global warming and the greenhouse effect , or into the way species evolve if left untouched .
because of this purpose , they are sometimes termed “ living laboratories . ”
biosphere reserves also have an educational aspect , since they function as role models for other reserves and often provide learning facilities , such as information centers . dw-radio looks at some of the most interesting biosphere reserves in germany in a special series produced in co-operation with unesco and the german federal agency for nature conservation . dw-world.de berchtesgaden : promoting sustainable development the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .
but if you look closely enough , you suddenly see life . angela kappler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wattenmeer nationalpark the wadden sea national park website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”

but the issue is loaded with the promise , opportunities and risks of new technologies . the solution to energy problems ; electricity in abundance for everyone ; medical wonders in the fight against cancer - the nuclear industry promised us a radiant future in the 1950s and 60s . ships , trains and cars would run as if magically driven by the atom 's elementary power .
everyone would have their own miniature nuclear reactor in the basement .
fast breeder nuclear reactors would multiply the world 's uranium provisions . those were the nuclear strategists ' visions .
the reality - several decades later - looks pitiful .
what remains of the radiant future are radiant reactor ruins , radiant plutonium waste and radiant liquid waste from nuclear reprocessing plants such as france 's la hague or britain 's sellafield . in medicine , admittedly , nuclear technology is indispensable .
but radiation therapy has n't been able to beat cancer . echoing the atomic era the promises of the genetic engineering industry today are reminiscent of the messianic messages of the nuclear era : conserve the environment by making insecticides , pesticides and herbicides unnecessary .
on top of everything else , genetically modified crops are supposed to put an end to world hunger . every new technology offers new opportunities .
that 's no less the case with genetic engineering .
gm bacteria already produce insulin , a great aid to millions of people stricken with diabetes .
in the past , thousands of cows and pigs had to be slaughtered to extract marginal amounts of insulin from their pancreases . but every new technology involves risks , and that applies just as well to genetic engineering .
so-called antibiotic-resistant genetic markers , for example , are built into half of the gm plants approved worldwide .
they allow genetic engineers to differentiate between manipulated and natural plants . what will happen when these plants are consumed by people and animals in large quantities ?
more and more people are resistant to antibiotics .
scientists blame it on the lax use of antibiotics in the medical field and in fattening up animals for sale .
if consumption of gm crops increases , drug-resistance could grow . killing the weed killer theoretically , pesticides , insecticides and herbicides could be dispensed with , since plants could be made resistant to pests .
but experience shows that gm companies frequently employ the technology to make the plants resistant to weed killer rather than to weeds .
the result is that crops must be sprayed even more , just as monsanto 's roundup ready corn has shown .
the corn is sold as a package together with the corresponding herbicide , roundup . environmentalists fear that the greatest risk is the uncontrolled proliferation of gm crops .
the long range effects of the large-scale cultivation of gm crops remain unclear .
pollen carried by bees or the wind , for example , can mingle with other natural plants .
the € 50,000 -lrb- $ 63,860 -rrb- fine for contaminating another farmer 's harvest that german agriculture minister renate künast uses as a threat in the law she presented monday to regulate gm crops certainly wo n't prevent the bees or the wind from disseminating pollen . gm crops wo n't stop famine but the greatest fiction is that genetic engineering will put an end to world hunger .
it 's easy to debunk , since starvation is n't caused by a worldwide lack of food .
instead , the problem is that so many people have too little money to afford food . famines usually develop because people lack purchasing power , that is , they do n't have money - whether due to wars , totalitarian intervention in the economic system or just because they do n't have the opportunity for reasonable development . genetic engineering wo n't change this fundamental problem .
indeed , it will make the problem even worse since seeds will become more expensive as genetic engineering firms attempt to recoup their immense development costs . it is time to realistically examine the opportunities and risks of genetic engineering .
we do n't need another technology like nuclear power that offers us a radiant future , but in the long run leaves us dealing with radiant waste . johannes beck -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to greenlight gm food labeling carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops .

two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .
faced with mounting criticism , the health minister has gone on the offensive – and promised changes . on monday evening , the german public television broadcaster ard aired a special report detailing the impact of germany ’ s sweeping healthcare reforms on the disabled and chronically ill , specifically those on social assistance who live in assisted living facilities and homes . at the heart of the report was the story of helga leonhard , a wheelchair-bound social welfare recipient who suffers from chronic pain and lives in a home in bad kreuznach , in the german state of north rhine-westphalia . under the new reforms , intended to cut costs in an already overburdened system , patients must pay a € 10 co-pay for their first visit to the doctor each quarter , transportation to and from the hospital is no longer covered , and patients must foot the bill for some of their medications . leonhard , who must be transported via ambulance to the hospital for weekly pain treatments , now faces an additional € 116 in health-related costs per month . considering that she only receives € 112 in discretionary income a month from social assistance benefits , that ’ s simply too much .
“ how am i supposed to pay , ” lamented leonhard .
her doctors fear leonhard and patients in similar situations – when faced with tough financial choices – will neglect their care . ulla schmidt on the defensive after airing the report on the evening news program “ tagesthemen , ” an ard anchor confronted german health minister ulla schmidt with leonhard 's case .
did this spell the end of the “ solidarity principle , ” which has so long underpinned the german healthcare system ? schmidt defended the reforms , claiming that – on the whole – they have been a success .
but the case of leonhard and others demonstrated that some adjustments needed to be made , which she promised would be forthcoming in the next week . “ those who are chronically ill or have paid for a medical transport , which they shouldn ’ t have , will be reimbursed , ” she promised .
schmidt stated that no one should experience undue financial distress due to the difficulties associated with the introduction of the reforms . however , in order to establish special rules for the “ chronically ill , ” a list must be established determining which illnesses will count as “ chronic . ”
with the government , public insurance agencies and doctors failing to establish such a list before ushering in the reforms on jan .
1 , officials have a bit of catch-up work to do .
again , schmidt promised this would also be resolved soon . ilka sax eckes , the government representative in charge of the affairs for people with disabilities in north rhine-westphalia , where leonhard lives , said the situation was a temporary “ transitional problem . ”
handicapped persons won ’ t have to pay more than € 71 per year , she claims , and special exceptions will be made to cover transportation costs for those incapable of getting to medical facilities on their own .
still , critics say that for some on social assistance , even that is too much . schmidt promises changes , cdu says ' not without us ' the questions that emerged in the report on monday night over the plight of the handicapped and chronically ill are just the latest in a series of criticisms germany ’ s health minister has faced since the start of the year . also part of the debate : what types of co-payments , if any , should be required for emergency medical attention and whether or not women should pay a co-payment when they visit their doctor for the sole purpose of getting a refill prescription for birth-control pills .
those decisions must all be made by the public health funds and doctors ' associations .
the government merely sets the framework , schmidt said . the health minister ’ s seeming willingness to debate some aspects of the healthcare reform package and , possibly , make changes , has worried some in the opposition christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . in the german mass circulation bild , andreas storm , a member of the cdu ’ s parliamentary faction , warned schmidt against promising any changes without discussing them with the cdu first .
such a process could unravel the compromise reached by the cdu and governing coalition of greens and democrats , he said . the package of reforms , which was approved by the german parliament in september , is aimed at reducing germany 's non-wage labor costs , which are thought to contribute to the weak economy , and cut € 20 billion from the soaring health care costs . in the meantime , patients like leonhard continue to wait in the wings , worried about their future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties finally forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system on friday after a marathon session .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets .

imaginary flat mates who slurp loudly schmidt , who studied interior design in darmstadt , first conceived the idea when she was preparing for a wall design competition in frankfurt together with her working partner , andrea baum .
she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .
in other words , it simulates the aural environment of having a roomie .
gabriela contolli , a spokeswoman for the delta music company told dw-world that although the " never alone again " cd made by a german producer in hamburg , was a few years old , it " attracts attention every time we get it out on the shelves . "
contolli added that the cd fit in with a growing trend of products aimed at singles at a time when there were so many of them .

offerings ranged from compact furniture , ready-to-swallow tablets packed with high fruit and vegetable content for the busy single , various beauty and fitness courses to funky sunglasses fitted with light-emitting diodes that promised deep relaxation from daily stress .
even today german singles have a mind-boggling array of products to choose from .
chief among them are kitchen appliances like a 45-centimeter-high mini dish washer from siemens that can be fitted onto the kitchen counter , a bread baking machine that can also bake just a single bread or a three-in-one multi-functional compact block that combines an oven , dishwasher and microwave for the space-strapped single household .

she told dw-world she was inspired by the cd " never alone again , " which made waves among germany ’ s singles scene last year .
the cd features soundbites such as the rustling of paper , the closing of a door , the whirring of a hairdryer and the slurping of coffee .

the bill is meant to establish a framework for farmers who want to grow gm crops as well as to ensure that consumers will be able to choose whether they want to buy the foods , which have generated considerable controversy and debate across europe .

european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe . the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .

the € 50,000 -lrb- $ 63,860 -rrb- fine for contaminating another farmer 's harvest that german agriculture minister renate künast uses as a threat in the law she presented monday to regulate gm crops certainly wo n't prevent the bees or the wind from disseminating pollen . gm crops wo n't stop famine but the greatest fiction is that genetic engineering will put an end to world hunger .
it 's easy to debunk , since starvation is n't caused by a worldwide lack of food .
instead , the problem is that so many people have too little money to afford food . famines usually develop because people lack purchasing power , that is , they do n't have money - whether due to wars , totalitarian intervention in the economic system or just because they do n't have the opportunity for reasonable development . genetic engineering wo n't change this fundamental problem .
indeed , it will make the problem even worse since seeds will become more expensive as genetic engineering firms attempt to recoup their immense development costs . it is time to realistically examine the opportunities and risks of genetic engineering .
we do n't need another technology like nuclear power that offers us a radiant future , but in the long run leaves us dealing with radiant waste . johannes beck -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to greenlight gm food labeling carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "
heyne is optimistic that the success of the fishing industry and the growth of tourism will make the people of upperlusatia develop a new relationship to the environment they live in .
the prouder they feel about the beautiful landscape around them , the more they ’ ll care about preserving it . mike mühlberger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape further information on the reserve 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de living planet -pipe- 13.01.2004 uniting man and nature nature parks and reserves are often regarded as lifeboats for the planet ’ s dwindling animal and plant species .
the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization -lrb- unesco -rrb- launched its own park concept in 1970 : the “ man and the biosphere ” -lrb- mab -rrb- program .
today , biosphere reserves exist in 97 countries . human development is an important part of the unesco biosphere concept .
the reserves are designed to protect nature and , at the same time , allow human beings to live within the park limits and use the land in a controlled and sustainable fashion .
even intensive agriculture and industry are permitted in certain areas . biosphere reserves also serve scientific interests .
data collected by scientists can offer insight into global warming and the greenhouse effect , or into the way species evolve if left untouched .
because of this purpose , they are sometimes termed “ living laboratories . ”
biosphere reserves also have an educational aspect , since they function as role models for other reserves and often provide learning facilities , such as information centers . dw-radio looks at some of the most interesting biosphere reserves in germany in a special series produced in co-operation with unesco and the german federal agency for nature conservation . dw-world.de berchtesgaden : promoting sustainable development the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .
but if you look closely enough , you suddenly see life . angela kappler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wattenmeer nationalpark the wadden sea national park website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .
but if you look closely enough , you suddenly see life . angela kappler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wattenmeer nationalpark the wadden sea national park website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .
but if you look closely enough , you suddenly see life . angela kappler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wattenmeer nationalpark the wadden sea national park website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

a plan to set up a biosphere reserve is often met with skepticism by local communities .
dw-radio spoke with the german federal agency for nature conservation about this problem . there are many advantages to a biosphere reserve .
yet it is particularly important to consider local people and their economies , especially in developing countries , when setting up such an area . there are many potential benefits for such groups , such as the protection of basic land and water resources , additional employment , an opportunity to maintain existing traditions and lifestyles , as well as a more healthy environment . but when a biosphere reserve is first established , the local populations are not always enthusiastic , as they need to alter their way of life and are no longer able to use certain areas as they please . dw-radio ’ s john hay talked with jürgen nauber , head of the division of international affairs and co-operation with germany ’ s federal agency for nature conservation , which hosts germany 's committee for the man and the biosphere program , and asked him how local communities tend to react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio ’ s award-winning environment magazine .

the wadden sea national park is renowned for its commitment to leaving nature to its own devices .
millions of visitors come to the coastal region each year to enjoy the peace and solitude of nature in its purest form . the wadden sea national park on germany ’ s northern coast was declared a unesco biosphere reserve site in 1990 .
as such , it restricts access to certain parts of the land to ensure protection for the plants and animals , which inhabit it .
but a trip to the wadden sea isn ’ t just about learning why we must preserve our natural heritage for future generations .
it ’ s about diving into the world of nature - and discovering its mysteries - right now .
the wadden sea is the largest unbroken stretch of tidal mudflats in the world .
it is an ecosystem with tidal creeks , mud flats , sand banks , salt marshes , islands , bays and rivers .
a " tidal flat " means a nearly flat coastal area , alternately covered and exposed by the tides .
when the tide is low , visitors can meander along the shore for hours , walking for miles out into the sea , and discovering an abundance of aquatic life forms along the way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve the land protected under the national park service is of significance to over two million migratory and coastal birds as a feeding and resting ground .
it is also an important area for a diversity of fish .
in total , 3,200 species of animals can be found in the park , including various mussels , snails , worms , as well as larger mammals , like seals and whales .
salt marshes are home to plants and animals that have especially adapted to survive in the saline environment .
there is nowhere else in the world where this size and combination of sands , dunes , salt marshes and islands exist .
a controversial issue but whether the national park should even exist is a sensitive issue in the region .
when an area of land is designated as a national park , plants are put under protection , the fishing industry is closely observed , access is restricted to tidal flats , and ships are prohibited from sailing in certain areas , so as not to endanger seals and whales .
fishermen , for one , may not be happy with the new rules and developments .
henning hansen , who has been a park ranger and field worker for the national park service for the past six years , explains that some people do not see the need to have a national park on the wadden sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wadden sea biosphere reserve " they say that they have always protected the land themselves , and don ’ t understand why someone else needs to tell them how to take care of it . "
according to hansen , the need for the land to be protected does exist , and that ’ s where the national park service comes in .
and yet the acceptance of a natural park is often a slow process .
it takes time for the wishes of the locals and the objectives of the park service to come closer together .
" nature is working perfectly . "
the best way to fully experience the wadden sea is to take a guided walking tour along the tidal flats .
along the tour , you can spot crustaceans , mussels , crabs , shrimp and barnacles .
according to andrea lütwick , a volunteer for the national park service , a tour allows you to discover life ’ s little mysteries .
" the miracles of nature in the wadden sea are not obvious here , " she says .
" many of them are underneath the soil , or hidden in some grass bundles , or flying somewhere .
so , you really need somebody to show you , otherwise it ’ s not so fascinating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking through the watt a walking tour along the coast allows you to see the habitats of tidal flats through the tour guide ’ s trained eyes .
" you get such an understanding of how nature is working perfectly , " says lütwick .
but it ’ s also a good idea to take a guided tour to avoid running into danger .
to walk on the mud flats is an adventure for many tourists : the land has a silty quality , not quite soil and not quite water , either .
at low tide , visitors can walk easily along mud flats and sink quite deeply into the mud .
but high tide can come in quickly , so it ’ s best to tour the mud flats with an experienced park ranger .
experiencing the wadden sea from the inside for those who prefer to spend at least part of their visit to the wadden sea indoors , the multimar wattforum also gets you " into " the wadden sea without disturbing it .
not your typical museum , the national park information center , located in tönning , presents life in the deep of the ocean , and offers another way to experience the wadden sea .
didactical elements , like sounds from under the sea , an underwater camera , and the sound of sea storms , allow you to closely experience nature .
you can put your hands right into selected water tanks .
according to museum director dr. gerd meurs , the idea is that presenting the exhibits in an interactive manner has a greater effect on visitors .
" the museum offers a different entry point to nature , meaning that when you yourself become an active participant in the exhibit , you become a lot closer to it , " meurs explains .
" you develop more questions , and receive more answers . "
the point of the multimar forum , as well as the wadden sea national park , is that with nature , you have to look closely to see what ’ s really there .
but if you look closely enough , you suddenly see life . angela kappler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links wattenmeer nationalpark the wadden sea national park website -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "
heyne is optimistic that the success of the fishing industry and the growth of tourism will make the people of upperlusatia develop a new relationship to the environment they live in .
the prouder they feel about the beautiful landscape around them , the more they ’ ll care about preserving it . mike mühlberger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape further information on the reserve 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization -lrb- unesco -rrb- launched its own park concept in 1970 : the “ man and the biosphere ” -lrb- mab -rrb- program .
today , biosphere reserves exist in 97 countries . human development is an important part of the unesco biosphere concept .
the reserves are designed to protect nature and , at the same time , allow human beings to live within the park limits and use the land in a controlled and sustainable fashion .
even intensive agriculture and industry are permitted in certain areas . biosphere reserves also serve scientific interests .
data collected by scientists can offer insight into global warming and the greenhouse effect , or into the way species evolve if left untouched .
because of this purpose , they are sometimes termed “ living laboratories . ”
biosphere reserves also have an educational aspect , since they function as role models for other reserves and often provide learning facilities , such as information centers . dw-radio looks at some of the most interesting biosphere reserves in germany in a special series produced in co-operation with unesco and the german federal agency for nature conservation . dw-world.de berchtesgaden : promoting sustainable development the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world .

rügen : preserving traditions and nature rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , due to its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions .
interview : integrating people into the biosphere a plan to set up a biosphere reserve is often met with skepticism by local communities .
dw-radio spoke with the german federal agency for nature conservation about this problem .
upperlusatia : fishing into the future the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .
more and more tourists are coming here .
and local communities have started to include us in their urban planning decisions . "
heyne is optimistic that the success of the fishing industry and the growth of tourism will make the people of upperlusatia develop a new relationship to the environment they live in .
the prouder they feel about the beautiful landscape around them , the more they ’ ll care about preserving it . mike mühlberger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape further information on the reserve 's activities -lrb- german only -rrb- .

the biosphere reserve upperlusatia covers the largest pond region in germany , with an 800-year tradition of fish farming .
the fishing industry here has come a long way and this success is in part because of the reserve . since its privatization following the collapse of east germany , the fishing industry in the upperlusatia region has progressed significantly .
it has cleaned up its act and has developed a much greater environmental awareness .
that today ’ s companies pride themselves in their natural fish farming methods is in part the success of the biosphere reserve upperlusatia heath and pond landscape , situated in the eastern state of saxony close to the polish border .
the fishermen in this region have discovered that the status of the reserve is a useful marketing tool .
they use it to prove that their fish , mainly carp , are a quality product .
" we have developed a way to raise carp as naturally as possible .
that means the fish can find everything they need in the ponds , we add only very little feed , " says arnulf rolli from the kreba fish company .
" so , it ’ s not like it was 20 years ago , when the fish were fattened artificially with pellets and all sorts of additives , " he adds .
" the fish today grow naturally , we just add some vitamins to make them more resistant to illnesses and parasites . "
both the fishermen and the biosphere reserve know they benefit from working together .
not only can the fishermen lay claim to a much better product , they also receive financial rewards for their contribution to the environment .
by switching to a more natural form of fish farming , they ’ re helping to create a more balanced ecosystem .
a wise investment for peter heyne , head of the biosphere reserve , such subsidies are a good investment .
since the reserve was founded in 1994 , compensating the fishermen for keeping less fish and protecting their ponds has paid off .
since they keep only a third of the number of fish they used to during the communist era , the water quality in the whole region has improved dramatically .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft " the canals and rivers here were so dirty ; there were hardly any fish left in them , " heyne says .
" we had such a high level of intensive fish farming in these ponds that there were hardly any water plants left . "
the ponds were so cramped with fish , there wasn ’ t enough oxygen in the water , he recalls .
" they had to pump oxygen into the ponds like into an aquarium .
they changed the landscape to make it suit their technology .
we ’ ve been able to revise that . "
protecting the cultural landscape the goal of the biosphere reserve is to protect this cultural landscape - a landscape that has been developed over centuries .
most of the ponds in the reserve are man-made .
many of them date back to the middle ages .
carp was already farmed here in the 13th century and sold mainly to the court of saxony .
in those days , it was a highly lucrative business , because it was impossible to buy seafood this far away from the coast .
with just 200 kilos of fish per hectare per year , the fish farmers then were able to preserve this pond landscape like a paradise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft even with today ’ s subsidies , three times that much yield is needed for the industry to survive .
the challenge for heyne and his staff has been to find a way to make the industry both economically and environmental sustainable .
" we carried out some research on how to optimize the yield , how we could achieve our goal of preserving both the landscape and the traditional industry , " heyne says .
" we found that we must structure the pond landscape in a way that we have some ponds where we allow intensive fish farming .
but we also have others , where there are less fish and where we allow no additional feed . "
the reserve also has ponds , which are not used commercially at all , which are purely a refuge for wildlife .
" this strategy has worked very well in recent years . "
creating awareness part of the biosphere ’ s mission is to try and create more awareness of the need to preserve natural landscapes .
for many years , in this part of eastern germany , people had no relationship to the environment they lived in .
during the communist period , the region ’ s chemical and coal-mining industries showed little regard for nature .
heyne remembers that one could tell the direction the wind was blowing by the color of the ponds .
the water was often covered in black soot from nearby coalmines and power plants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberlausitzer heide- und teichlandschaft those dirty industries have now gone , but so too have thousands of jobs .
heyne knows that to secure public support for the reserve and its goals , environmental protection mustn ’ t be seen to stand in the way of economic development .
" we ’ ve proven that the underlying principle of the biosphere reserve is true , " he says .
" it is possible to harmonize business and environmental interests .
the word has started to spread throughout germany that the region has become more attractive since we ’ ve been taking care of the environment .

rügen is well known in germany as a place of natural beauty , with its rugged coastlines and protected forests .
it is also home to a biosphere reserve , which is aiming to combine this nature with unique rural traditions . just off the coast of northeastern germany in the baltic sea lies the island of rügen .
it has been a popular destination for seaside holidays for more than a hundred years .
the chalk sea cliffs are the main attraction for most of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come to the island each year . but the landscape of rügen is , in fact , much more varied .
rolling green pastures sweep down to coastal grasslands and temperate broadleaf forests .
the banks along the island ’ s inland waterways are covered with reeds and grass . in 1991 , a biosphere reserve measuring some 200 square kilometers was set up in the southeast corner of the island .
here , human development exists alongside the natural wonders . promoting organic farming biosphere reserves are made up of a core , buffer and transition zone .
the core area is not subject to human activity .
the surrounding buffer zone includes activities , which do not hinder the conservation objectives of the core area , but rather help to protect it .
finally , there is the transition area extending outwards , which may contain a variety of agricultural activities , human settlements and other uses . the majority of land in the south-east rügen biosphere ’ s transition zone is used for farming .
michael weigelt , head of the biosphere authority , works with farmers and fishermen in the area to encourage them to take on organic , traditional farming methods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen according to weigelt , such organic practices help preserve the traditional landscape and culture , as well as produce healthier food .
“ debates on this issue surface again and again , and there has just been one scandal after another in the agricultural sector , ” he says . mad cow disease , swine fever and other problems arise repeatedly .
“ and in the end , we come to the same conclusion : that we can only prevent these scandals by returning to a regional perspective . ” this concept allows farmers to check animals from birth through to processing , to ascertain which animal is which , how it has grown up , what it has been fed , and how it has been treated , says weigelt .
“ in a huge global market , everything can ’ t be controlled like this . ” a unique farm experience in the town of groß zicker , for example , a farm run by frank westphal and his father fits into the biosphere concept .
they are raising a native animal species otherwise faced with extinction . westphal ’ s sheep are a special breed only found in the state of mecklenburg-western pomernia .
“ they ’ re an endangered species , which we use here to conserve the landscape , to make sure some plants don ’ t grow out of control , ” he explains . westphal has to compete with less expensive products coming from overseas .
he thus had the idea to supplement his income by creating a tourist attraction on the farm , where people can see the sheep and buy the wool and meat . even now , some of the best wool is spun and sold to tourists in shops in town .
westphal counts on making his money from these tourists , who are willing to pay a little more for a regional product . the whole emphasis is on diversity , on people wanting to experience something from the region , like his animals , which are supposed to taste delicious .
“ the sheep mature slowly , ” he explains .
“ they are not fed conditioning pellets , but grow up eating grain produced here and grass from our fields and stay healthy from our fresh sea air . ” the biosphere as a job motor a further aim in the biosphere is protecting cultural diversity .
rügen has its own traditional music , dance and local dialect .
the culture reflects in many ways the hard working , rural past of the island . but rügen has a lot of problems with high unemployment .
the biosphere authority ’ s weigelt has attempted to change this by encouraging the sale of locally made handicrafts .
since 1999 , a scheme called the “ biosphere job motor ” has given more than thirty people the chance to gain employment or to create businesses that fit into the biosphere concept . weigelt is a pioneer in this respect .
much of what is taking place in the biosphere is being attempted for the first time and he would like to see more long-term monitoring of the impact biosphere projects are having on the environment “ according to unesco , research and monitoring is an important task for biospheres , but for that you need money and personnel , and we don ’ t have either , ” says weigelt .
“ we work a lot with universities and , since 1993 , we have had partnerships with several technical colleges .
but as for a proper , area-wide monitoring program with all the parameters , so that we can check whether everything we are doing is really having the desired effect , we don ’ t have that and we really don ’ t have the capacity to put one in place . ” publicity through personal interaction the biosphere has received little publicity so far .
weigelt talks of slowing winning partners by personal interaction .
the authorities offer visitors educational activities , and brochures explaining the concept are available for both tourists and residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen visitors come to rügen to experience the natural environment and unique culture .
but although tourists want to get away from modern culture and big cities , they do still expect all the regular comforts at a reasonable price . this has resulted in some tension in south-east rügen between the growing tourism sector and the environment .
some of the residents of the biosphere oppose conservation when it prevents development , because development means jobs and unemployment in rügen is high . gunnar hübner rents apartments and holiday houses in the region .
he argues that to keep tourists coming you have to give them what they want : a protected natural environment and the chance to experience a different way of life . “ that ’ s where this feeling comes from , when you say , when i was a child that was around , and i want to show it to my children , i want to show it to other people , ” says hübner .
“ i want to see that again , i want to experience it for myself again , i want that ‘ revival effect , ’ to feel happy and for people to feel happy when they leave the island . ” he says only happy people will bring more tourists and help create a lasting long-term perspective for rügen . martin vogl send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links nationalparkamt rügen rügen ’ s national park authority , responsible for the south-east rügen biosphere reserve -lrb- german only -rrb- .

dw-radio spoke with the german federal agency for nature conservation about this problem . there are many advantages to a biosphere reserve .
yet it is particularly important to consider local people and their economies , especially in developing countries , when setting up such an area . there are many potential benefits for such groups , such as the protection of basic land and water resources , additional employment , an opportunity to maintain existing traditions and lifestyles , as well as a more healthy environment . but when a biosphere reserve is first established , the local populations are not always enthusiastic , as they need to alter their way of life and are no longer able to use certain areas as they please . dw-radio ’ s john hay talked with jürgen nauber , head of the division of international affairs and co-operation with germany ’ s federal agency for nature conservation , which hosts germany 's committee for the man and the biosphere program , and asked him how local communities tend to react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio ’ s award-winning environment magazine .

peter hain said he was prepared to listen to the arguments in favour of increased powers but that there should not be seen as a solution to tackling wales ' problems .
" mps will look , as i am doing , at any case for change on its merits , " mr hain told bbc radio wales .
" if a persuasive case is put then we will be convinced " the neath mp is entering the devolution debate amid growing speculation over the report of a commission set up to consider the case for transferring more powers from westminster .
it is thought that the richard commission , which is likely to report in the spring , will recommend increasing the number of assembly members from 60 to 80 - and giving them more law-making powers .
but mr hain has said that a scottish-style parliament is not on the agenda .
law-making powers the commission has spent several months canvassing the opinions of members of the public in a series of seven public meetings .
it will eventually make recommendations on issues including the welsh electoral system and whether the assembly needs greater authority , similar to the law-making powers of the scottish parliament .
mr hain has said that the number of welsh mps should remain at 40 .
he did not , he said , want a repeat of the scottish experience , where plans to reduce the number of mps at westminster have caused problems for labour .
he added that there had to be a consensus for any change between westminster and cardiff .
as things stand , changes to the devolution settlement can only be made in westminster .
any change in tax-varying poweres would have to go to a referendum , said mr hain .

since the new year , nine dead dolphins have been found in devon , and 30 dead dolphins and porpoises have been washed up in cornwall .
skin missing from their fins and other parts of their bodies indicates they have been caught in trawlers ' nets .
figures for 2002-2003 show 250 cetaceans were found dead on cornwall 's beaches while 80 were found on devon 's shores .
moratorium call conservationists say that audible " pingers " and escape hatches in nets , introduced to reduce the number of cetacean deaths off the uk coastline , are not working .
marine expert nick tregenza said : " if the dolphins found good feeding here last year , you might get even more animals this year .
" and if it turns out that the dolphins and the fishermen are targeting the same shoals of fish we are in for a heavy mortality again . "
torbay liberal democrat mp adrian sanders said : " we are going to have to do something dramatic to stop the deaths .

stopped disease separate studies have also shown that vitamin d supplements can prevent or favourably affect the course of a disease similar to ms in mice .
and other research has found that people with ms tend to have insufficient levels of vitamin d , that periods of low vitamin d occur before times of high disease activity , and periods of high vitamin d precede times of low disease activity .

stephanie sim of the royal society for the protection of birds said that the 25th annual big garden bird watch drew the public 's attention to their role in preserving their world .
" there is so much more we can do to live more harmoniously with wildlife and improve our quality of life at the same time , " she said .
a celebrity chef from northern ireland is helping promote the watch which is the largest survey of its kind in the world .
jenny bristow will cook up treats for the birds in her garden as the rspb calls on people to spend an hour recording the varieties of birds that they see . "
when we buy local and organic we are telling farmers that we value the fact that they farm in harmony with the land " stephanie sim media officer rspb " people are asked to observe the birds in their garden , a local park or simply out of their windows for an hour , and send their findings to the rspb , " said ms sim , the media and events officer for the society in northern ireland .
she said there was a serious point to the exercise .
" the results are compiled and used to see how our garden birds are fairing .
any decline in them signals a deterioration in the quality of our environment . "
it was from surveys such as these that it became obvious that once common birds such as the starling and house sparrow were beginning to decline dramatically .
declines in bird numbers indicate that the environment has less wildlife which may be a result of more pollution and poorer water and air quality .
" you can be sure that a wildlife garden that uses less pesticides and weed killers will have more birds .
when we buy local and organic we are telling farmers that we value the fact that they farm in harmony with the land , " ms sim said .
in the 2003 survey , the starling was recorded as the most common bird in northern ireland gardens .
the house sparrow was in second place and was followed by the chaffinch , blue tit , greenfinch , blackbird , coal tit , great tit , robin and collared dove .
those who wish to take part in the big garden bird watch can contact the rspb northern ireland at 028 9049 1547 or log onto the website at www.rspb.org.uk / birdwatch .
