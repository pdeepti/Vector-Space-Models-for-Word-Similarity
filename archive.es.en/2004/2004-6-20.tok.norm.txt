the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .
since sevestre only has her father 's first name - no family name or rank - the german archives service hasn ’ t been able to help her .
but she ’ s not giving up hope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as she looks through the few photos she has of her mother and herself as a child , sevestre takes comfort in the fact she no longer feels alone .
thanks to the book project , she has been in touch with many other children of german soldiers .
they often share the same childhood stories of mistreatment and shame .

libyan officials negotiating compensation to victims of a 1986 bomb attack in berlin are demanding money for victims of german world war ii mines as well as the extradition of libyan opposition members . hussin akeel , one of the libyan negotiators , said meeting the demands would " positively influence " the talks , according to german news magazine focus . the demands came as a surprise to german lawyers for the more than 160 non-american victims of the attack on berlin 's " la belle " nightclub , which killed two american soldiers and a turkish woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle nightclub after the attack a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service had planned the attack and sentenced four people to long prison terms .
a federal appeals court is expected to decide on thursday whether the cases have to be tried again . although five rounds of talks had been unsuccessful , german negotiators had kept talking about an " open and constructive atmosphere " and said they expected to reach an agreement in the near future . the amount of money paid to the victims had been the main problem so far as the german lawyers are demanding more money than the libyans are willing to pay .
the money , potentially as much as $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.2 million -rrb- , is expected to come from the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . gadhafi needs an agreement on the matter in order for libya to be admitted to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries .
membership would help gadhafi in his efforts to rejoin the international community . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court reexamines berlin bombing case a federal appeals court in leipzig is reviewing the sentences handed down in the case of the 1986 bomb attack on a disco in berlin that killed three people and injured more than 200 .

" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .
since sevestre only has her father 's first name - no family name or rank - the german archives service hasn ’ t been able to help her .
but she ’ s not giving up hope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as she looks through the few photos she has of her mother and herself as a child , sevestre takes comfort in the fact she no longer feels alone .
thanks to the book project , she has been in touch with many other children of german soldiers .
they often share the same childhood stories of mistreatment and shame .
however , there is strength in numbers and they talk of forming an association for children of the war . geneviève oger -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in pomp-filled ceremonies , europe remembers d-day george w. bush , jacques chirac and other european leaders gather to commemorate d-day .

" we had to go with what the market was telling us and the market is always right , " klaus zumwinkel , the ceo of postbank 's parent company , deutsche post , told reporters on sunday .
he added that a couple of days of postponement for the public offering surely did n't make a difference after years of preparing the move . company officials are expected to raise about € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- with the initial public offering - € 400 million less than they had hoped for to reduce debt and expand postbank 's distribution network in europe . postbank will sell two-thirds of the 82 million postbank shares to the public in addition to offering a € 1 billion convertible bond issued by deutsche post that will pay between 2 and 3 percent interest and can be exchanged for shares in three years , bloomberg reported . speculation about the success or failure of postbank 's public debut has been rife and the road to the ipo has been anything but smooth .
there have been leaked memos , accusations of overpricing , scathing media reports decrying germany 's financial community as a bunch of gossips whose favorite activity is preaching defeatism , especially when it comes to financial markets .
the rumor mill has only been picking up speed as the big day approaches . but despite the criticism of a very sloppy preparation for this important stock market debut , which many hope will revive the country 's moribund shareholder culture , the bank floatation has potential and a good many analysts and small investors think it could succeed .
however , competition in europe is intense and postbank will have to prove itself before it fully gains the confidence of the financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank headquarters in bonn as a private bank , postbank , germany 's largest retail bank by customers , can hold its own with the nation 's other big banks such as deutsche bank , dresdner bank und commerzbank . but its real direct competitors are outside germany 's borders : banco popular in spain , italy 's unicredito , austria 's erste bank , svenska handelsbanken in sweden or the british banks alliance & leicester as well as the royal bank of scotland .
these are all institutions which conduct most of their business in the retail sector . efficient models these banks are largely profitable , efficient and count among the darlings of analysts , who are fond of recommending their stock to clients , especially since the banking sector offers investors deals like never before and the private banks are , as a group , undervalued .
the price-earnings ratio based on 2005 estimates is averaged at just over 10 .
the postbank 's price-earnings ratio is between 11 and 13 . that means as far as profitability goes , postbank trails other european banks .
" the return on equity in low compared to international competitors , " guido hoymann of the frankfurt-based metzler bank told dw-world .
the return on equity at postbank is barely in the double digits .
with english banks , the return lies at around 20 percent in some cases , he said , adding that french banks have a rate of about 15 percent . the three-pillar handicap according to hoymann , postbank 's profitability suffers under the dominance of germany 's savings and cooperative banks , especially since the savings banks control around 50 percent of the retail banking market . experts largely agree that germany 's historical banking landscape , structured around a so-called three-pillar system of private banks , savings banks and cooperative banks is one of the main barriers to a much-needed consolidation of the country 's banking sector .
the dense network of banking branches makes germany one of europe 's most competitive countries .
that intense competition in an already fragmented market hurts profit margins in the credit business .
the result : rates of return are relatively low . european banking champions the view is different in the rest of europe . " in france , 60 percent of the market is controlled by five of the biggest banks , " said jörn kissenkötter , an analyst with m. m. warburg .
in germany on the other hand , the five biggest institutions only have about 20 percent of the market . in italy , one of the country 's oldest banks , banca commerciale italiana , has joined forces with five region savings banks for form unicredito italiano .
while profits have suffered recently , unicredito still counts among europe 's most successful banks . british banks have also been held up as models of retail banking , although according to hoymann , growth potential in this market " looks to be exhausted . " spain has also proved to be a lucrative banking location .
its third largest bank , banco popular , is proving to be a " monster when it comes to returns , " kissenkötter said .
according to the financial daily handelsblatt , banco popular has an income-to-equity ratio of 37 percent .
its cost-income ratio for 2005 is estimated to come in at 33 percent .
for germany 's postbank , that figure is forecast to be 71.7 percent .
part of banco popular 's success , according to kissenkötter , has to do with the spanish economy , which is enjoying a boom in the real estate market . postbank in pretty good shape banker hoymann is not ready to take part in the widespread scepticism about postbank 's stock market debut .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .
but kolinko seemed untroubled by the optimistic high balls that constituted germany 's shots on goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 91 minutes on the clock , miroslav klose could have sewn the game up with a free header with only kolinko to beat but his diving effort flew embarrassingly wide .
there was barely any time for klose to hide his face before the final whistle sounded and germany left the pitch to face the criticism which will surely follow this upset . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler hopes to navigate potential latvian pitfall germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .
should germany come a cropper , the euro 2004 adventure would surely be over .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .
but kolinko seemed untroubled by the optimistic high balls that constituted germany 's shots on goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 91 minutes on the clock , miroslav klose could have sewn the game up with a free header with only kolinko to beat but his diving effort flew embarrassingly wide .

bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .
but kolinko seemed untroubled by the optimistic high balls that constituted germany 's shots on goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 91 minutes on the clock , miroslav klose could have sewn the game up with a free header with only kolinko to beat but his diving effort flew embarrassingly wide .
there was barely any time for klose to hide his face before the final whistle sounded and germany left the pitch to face the criticism which will surely follow this upset . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler hopes to navigate potential latvian pitfall germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

libyan officials negotiating compensation to victims of a 1986 bomb attack in berlin are demanding money for victims of german world war ii mines as well as the extradition of libyan opposition members . hussin akeel , one of the libyan negotiators , said meeting the demands would " positively influence " the talks , according to german news magazine focus . the demands came as a surprise to german lawyers for the more than 160 non-american victims of the attack on berlin 's " la belle " nightclub , which killed two american soldiers and a turkish woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle nightclub after the attack a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service had planned the attack and sentenced four people to long prison terms .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .

the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .

" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .

" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .
since sevestre only has her father 's first name - no family name or rank - the german archives service hasn ’ t been able to help her .

the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .
but kolinko seemed untroubled by the optimistic high balls that constituted germany 's shots on goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 91 minutes on the clock , miroslav klose could have sewn the game up with a free header with only kolinko to beat but his diving effort flew embarrassingly wide .
there was barely any time for klose to hide his face before the final whistle sounded and germany left the pitch to face the criticism which will surely follow this upset . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler hopes to navigate potential latvian pitfall germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .

according to the financial daily handelsblatt , banco popular has an income-to-equity ratio of 37 percent .
its cost-income ratio for 2005 is estimated to come in at 33 percent .

" we had to go with what the market was telling us and the market is always right , " klaus zumwinkel , the ceo of postbank 's parent company , deutsche post , told reporters on sunday .
he added that a couple of days of postponement for the public offering surely did n't make a difference after years of preparing the move . company officials are expected to raise about € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- with the initial public offering - € 400 million less than they had hoped for to reduce debt and expand postbank 's distribution network in europe . postbank will sell two-thirds of the 82 million postbank shares to the public in addition to offering a € 1 billion convertible bond issued by deutsche post that will pay between 2 and 3 percent interest and can be exchanged for shares in three years , bloomberg reported . speculation about the success or failure of postbank 's public debut has been rife and the road to the ipo has been anything but smooth .
there have been leaked memos , accusations of overpricing , scathing media reports decrying germany 's financial community as a bunch of gossips whose favorite activity is preaching defeatism , especially when it comes to financial markets .
the rumor mill has only been picking up speed as the big day approaches . but despite the criticism of a very sloppy preparation for this important stock market debut , which many hope will revive the country 's moribund shareholder culture , the bank floatation has potential and a good many analysts and small investors think it could succeed .
however , competition in europe is intense and postbank will have to prove itself before it fully gains the confidence of the financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank headquarters in bonn as a private bank , postbank , germany 's largest retail bank by customers , can hold its own with the nation 's other big banks such as deutsche bank , dresdner bank und commerzbank . but its real direct competitors are outside germany 's borders : banco popular in spain , italy 's unicredito , austria 's erste bank , svenska handelsbanken in sweden or the british banks alliance & leicester as well as the royal bank of scotland .
these are all institutions which conduct most of their business in the retail sector . efficient models these banks are largely profitable , efficient and count among the darlings of analysts , who are fond of recommending their stock to clients , especially since the banking sector offers investors deals like never before and the private banks are , as a group , undervalued .
the price-earnings ratio based on 2005 estimates is averaged at just over 10 .
the postbank 's price-earnings ratio is between 11 and 13 . that means as far as profitability goes , postbank trails other european banks .
" the return on equity in low compared to international competitors , " guido hoymann of the frankfurt-based metzler bank told dw-world .
the return on equity at postbank is barely in the double digits .
with english banks , the return lies at around 20 percent in some cases , he said , adding that french banks have a rate of about 15 percent . the three-pillar handicap according to hoymann , postbank 's profitability suffers under the dominance of germany 's savings and cooperative banks , especially since the savings banks control around 50 percent of the retail banking market . experts largely agree that germany 's historical banking landscape , structured around a so-called three-pillar system of private banks , savings banks and cooperative banks is one of the main barriers to a much-needed consolidation of the country 's banking sector .
the dense network of banking branches makes germany one of europe 's most competitive countries .
that intense competition in an already fragmented market hurts profit margins in the credit business .
the result : rates of return are relatively low . european banking champions the view is different in the rest of europe . " in france , 60 percent of the market is controlled by five of the biggest banks , " said jörn kissenkötter , an analyst with m. m. warburg .
in germany on the other hand , the five biggest institutions only have about 20 percent of the market . in italy , one of the country 's oldest banks , banca commerciale italiana , has joined forces with five region savings banks for form unicredito italiano .
while profits have suffered recently , unicredito still counts among europe 's most successful banks . british banks have also been held up as models of retail banking , although according to hoymann , growth potential in this market " looks to be exhausted . " spain has also proved to be a lucrative banking location .
its third largest bank , banco popular , is proving to be a " monster when it comes to returns , " kissenkötter said .

a federal appeals court is expected to decide on thursday whether the cases have to be tried again . although five rounds of talks had been unsuccessful , german negotiators had kept talking about an " open and constructive atmosphere " and said they expected to reach an agreement in the near future . the amount of money paid to the victims had been the main problem so far as the german lawyers are demanding more money than the libyans are willing to pay .
the money , potentially as much as $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.2 million -rrb- , is expected to come from the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . gadhafi needs an agreement on the matter in order for libya to be admitted to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries .

" we 're making sure that people , who have lived in germany and want to return home , get the help they need , " said uschi eid , the ministry 's state secretary , after a recent meeting with kosovo 's labor minister ahmet isufi .
she added that the ministry program helps people start their own companies or find jobs in the private or public sector . since 2000 , about 3,000 people have found employment this way - 2,220 of them had returned to their homeland from germany .
more than 250 business start-ups received funding from germany during the first year , with 85 percent of those companies still operating today . so far , germany has given about € 177 million -lrb- $ 213 million -rrb- to kosovo to pay for a variety of projects .
ministry officials , however , do n't just see the help as a way to ensure people have an income , but also as a means to prevent further conflicts - an important issue in the province , as the most recent ethnic clashes in march showed . " we know that economic prosperity is a good foundation for development as well as reconciliation , " eid said , adding that her ministry will also continue to pay for projects once funding from the german foreign ministry ceases . kosovo 's ahmet isufi agrees with eid that a secure income helps to prevent violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 20.06.2004 czech republic qualify for quarter-final in absolute classic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan baros scored a scorching volley to tie the game at 2-2 players and spectators alike were fighting for breath in aviero as the czech republic fought back from two-nil down to beat holland 2-3 and reach the quarter-finals of euro 2004 . with a quarter-final place beckoning the czech republic after winning their first match against latvia , the group d leaders set their stall out from the start with some inventive and determined play .
milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .
but kolinko seemed untroubled by the optimistic high balls that constituted germany 's shots on goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 91 minutes on the clock , miroslav klose could have sewn the game up with a free header with only kolinko to beat but his diving effort flew embarrassingly wide .
there was barely any time for klose to hide his face before the final whistle sounded and germany left the pitch to face the criticism which will surely follow this upset . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler hopes to navigate potential latvian pitfall germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .

german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .

the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .

with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 20.06.2004 czech republic qualify for quarter-final in absolute classic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan baros scored a scorching volley to tie the game at 2-2 players and spectators alike were fighting for breath in aviero as the czech republic fought back from two-nil down to beat holland 2-3 and reach the quarter-finals of euro 2004 . with a quarter-final place beckoning the czech republic after winning their first match against latvia , the group d leaders set their stall out from the start with some inventive and determined play .
milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .
holland : van der sar ; heitinga , bouma , stam , van bronckhorst ; seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , robben , van nistelrooy .
subs : westerveld , waterreus , reiziger , kluivert , van der vaart , bosvelt , de boer , makaay , overmars , sneijder , van hooijdonk , zenden .

picture a windy day on an exposed cattle field in november sometime in the 1970 's or 1980 's .
the coveted ball swirls in the growing tempest as two amateur teams contest for supremacy in conditions more akin to the battlefields of flanders .
the rain turns to hail as the referee 's whistle brings the latest ordeal to a close .
after such a game , the overwhelming feeling would not be of ecstasy at the victory or despair at the loss but the rather sore and exposed stinging of irritated skin .
because in those days , the shirts on the players ' backs were worn only to determine one team from the other , not to provide comfort or make a fashion statement .
they were not even intended to protect players from the elements .
rough materials which rubbed the flesh raw , collars so wide and pointed they needed corks on the end to prevent eye injuries and shorts so tight it was debatable whether the men who wore them would ever get a chance to enjoy the sport with their offspring .
this was the harsh and often painful reality of soccer kits in the age before commercialism took hold in the game .
fabric technology offers comfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack wears the new germany shirt on display in portugal .
in these days of breathable , lightweight fabrics , the idea of pulling on your team 's colors and getting the clothing equivalent of thirty lashes will be totally alien to anyone whose only experience of soccer shirts will be the smooth glide of silky , temperature controlling polyester .
no one would spend in excess of € 60 on a soccer shirt if 90 minutes of wearing it resulted in a rash .
just as the modern game requires more from its players , so does it demand more from its equipment .
soccer is a global game and the teams at the top are required to challenge for glory in environments as diverse as the bone-chilling ice fields of the ukraine and the sweltering stadium-cum-ovens of dubai .
kit manufacturers are well aware that teams require equipment which will leave the players to concentrate on just one thing - the game itself .
all of the teams appearing at euro 2004 , regardless of whether they turn out in nike , adidas , umbro , puma or kappa , will be wearing shirts a million miles away from the scratchy uniforms of yesteryear .
with the introduction of moisture management systems such as the play dry technology that keeps the players cooler , drier and more comfortable , soccer is now played in relative luxury .
england calls in rocket scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's wayne rooney can comfortabley raise his arms without fear of scratchy material .
one wonders why the manufacturers of the past never embraced the simple concept of comfort .
it 's hardly rocket science .
except these days , that 's exactly what it is .
the england team has enlisted nasa experts in an attempt to deal with the heat in portugal during the european championships .
the new second strip , which has been developed by sports company umbro in association with u.s. space boffins , is pushing the boundaries in kit design and innovation .
the red shirt is made from 99.9 percent silver weave called x-static and claims to warm the players in lower temperatures and cool them in hot environments .
the manufacturer claims the heat transfer and moisture management system is a first for football and it is hoped that it will pay dividends when employed by england in portugal this summer .
supporters boost shirt profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of german soccer fans wearing their country 's kit .
the companies responsible for kitting out the euro 2004 competitors are not only concerned with developing innovative technology for their clients .
they are also well aware that the 22 men in each international squad will not be the only ones to sport their shirts .
the stadiums of portugal will be filled with fans displaying their countries colors in the stands .
just as the tickly aertex of bygone days is now a thing of the past , thankfully so are the designers who sent their teams out to do battle in shirts which would n't have looked out of place in a garage sale or charity shop .
fashion is a factor that sports manufacturers have finally cottoned onto .

soccer is a global game and the teams at the top are required to challenge for glory in environments as diverse as the bone-chilling ice fields of the ukraine and the sweltering stadium-cum-ovens of dubai .
kit manufacturers are well aware that teams require equipment which will leave the players to concentrate on just one thing - the game itself .
all of the teams appearing at euro 2004 , regardless of whether they turn out in nike , adidas , umbro , puma or kappa , will be wearing shirts a million miles away from the scratchy uniforms of yesteryear .
with the introduction of moisture management systems such as the play dry technology that keeps the players cooler , drier and more comfortable , soccer is now played in relative luxury .
england calls in rocket scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's wayne rooney can comfortabley raise his arms without fear of scratchy material .
one wonders why the manufacturers of the past never embraced the simple concept of comfort .
it 's hardly rocket science .
except these days , that 's exactly what it is .
the england team has enlisted nasa experts in an attempt to deal with the heat in portugal during the european championships .
the new second strip , which has been developed by sports company umbro in association with u.s. space boffins , is pushing the boundaries in kit design and innovation .
the red shirt is made from 99.9 percent silver weave called x-static and claims to warm the players in lower temperatures and cool them in hot environments .
the manufacturer claims the heat transfer and moisture management system is a first for football and it is hoped that it will pay dividends when employed by england in portugal this summer .
supporters boost shirt profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of german soccer fans wearing their country 's kit .
the companies responsible for kitting out the euro 2004 competitors are not only concerned with developing innovative technology for their clients .
they are also well aware that the 22 men in each international squad will not be the only ones to sport their shirts .
the stadiums of portugal will be filled with fans displaying their countries colors in the stands .
just as the tickly aertex of bygone days is now a thing of the past , thankfully so are the designers who sent their teams out to do battle in shirts which would n't have looked out of place in a garage sale or charity shop .
fashion is a factor that sports manufacturers have finally cottoned onto .
the rise of the soccer shirt as fashion accessory can be charted back to the recent past when giorgio armani designed the italian national team 's shirts for the 1994 world cup .
the styling was typically italian chic and the shirt became as popular off the pitch as on it .
the mid-90 's saw an explosion in fans wearing their team colors on days other than match days as the image of the soccer fan attempted to move away from that of the perma-kitted hooligan .
female interest takes fashion to another level the embracing of the game and the fashions by female fans also took off at the same time and helped to promote the new , changing face of the game .
as a result , companies reported a marked increase in sales to female supporters and now are selling specially tailored women 's replica shirts along side those popular with the boys .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no self-respecting fan would be seen without their team 's colors .
add to this the soaring profile of the soccer star as celebrity and the team shirt has become de rigueur for fans the world over ; for those wanting to show their allegiance , for those who follow the individual icons of the game and those who just like the style regardless if its their team or not .
shirt manufacturers have harnessed the power of the soccer shirt as a marketing tool and an essential piece of modern clothing .
the european championships are seen as a lucrative time for the sports manufacturers .
adidas , the german sports giant that provides the kit for the german , french , latvian , greek and spanish national teams at the tournament , are expecting great things .
adidas hoping for great returns anne putz of adidas salomon told dw-world that , although sales figures for their shirts would not be available until after the tournament , in general soccer accounts for 15 percent of the total sales of the company 's sports division .
she also added that since adidas started producing soccer clothing in 1972 , teams wearing the company 's shirts have won all but one european championship .
with the popularity of the soccer shirt now assured and the advances in kit production , the 2004 european championships are likely to be the most fashionable , dry and well-ventilated on record for players and supporters alike . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" we had to go with what the market was telling us and the market is always right , " klaus zumwinkel , the ceo of postbank 's parent company , deutsche post , told reporters on sunday .
he added that a couple of days of postponement for the public offering surely did n't make a difference after years of preparing the move . company officials are expected to raise about € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- with the initial public offering - € 400 million less than they had hoped for to reduce debt and expand postbank 's distribution network in europe . postbank will sell two-thirds of the 82 million postbank shares to the public in addition to offering a € 1 billion convertible bond issued by deutsche post that will pay between 2 and 3 percent interest and can be exchanged for shares in three years , bloomberg reported . speculation about the success or failure of postbank 's public debut has been rife and the road to the ipo has been anything but smooth .
there have been leaked memos , accusations of overpricing , scathing media reports decrying germany 's financial community as a bunch of gossips whose favorite activity is preaching defeatism , especially when it comes to financial markets .
the rumor mill has only been picking up speed as the big day approaches . but despite the criticism of a very sloppy preparation for this important stock market debut , which many hope will revive the country 's moribund shareholder culture , the bank floatation has potential and a good many analysts and small investors think it could succeed .
however , competition in europe is intense and postbank will have to prove itself before it fully gains the confidence of the financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank headquarters in bonn as a private bank , postbank , germany 's largest retail bank by customers , can hold its own with the nation 's other big banks such as deutsche bank , dresdner bank und commerzbank . but its real direct competitors are outside germany 's borders : banco popular in spain , italy 's unicredito , austria 's erste bank , svenska handelsbanken in sweden or the british banks alliance & leicester as well as the royal bank of scotland .
these are all institutions which conduct most of their business in the retail sector . efficient models these banks are largely profitable , efficient and count among the darlings of analysts , who are fond of recommending their stock to clients , especially since the banking sector offers investors deals like never before and the private banks are , as a group , undervalued .
the price-earnings ratio based on 2005 estimates is averaged at just over 10 .
the postbank 's price-earnings ratio is between 11 and 13 . that means as far as profitability goes , postbank trails other european banks .
" the return on equity in low compared to international competitors , " guido hoymann of the frankfurt-based metzler bank told dw-world .
the return on equity at postbank is barely in the double digits .
with english banks , the return lies at around 20 percent in some cases , he said , adding that french banks have a rate of about 15 percent . the three-pillar handicap according to hoymann , postbank 's profitability suffers under the dominance of germany 's savings and cooperative banks , especially since the savings banks control around 50 percent of the retail banking market . experts largely agree that germany 's historical banking landscape , structured around a so-called three-pillar system of private banks , savings banks and cooperative banks is one of the main barriers to a much-needed consolidation of the country 's banking sector .
the dense network of banking branches makes germany one of europe 's most competitive countries .
that intense competition in an already fragmented market hurts profit margins in the credit business .
the result : rates of return are relatively low . european banking champions the view is different in the rest of europe . " in france , 60 percent of the market is controlled by five of the biggest banks , " said jörn kissenkötter , an analyst with m. m. warburg .
in germany on the other hand , the five biggest institutions only have about 20 percent of the market . in italy , one of the country 's oldest banks , banca commerciale italiana , has joined forces with five region savings banks for form unicredito italiano .
while profits have suffered recently , unicredito still counts among europe 's most successful banks . british banks have also been held up as models of retail banking , although according to hoymann , growth potential in this market " looks to be exhausted . " spain has also proved to be a lucrative banking location .
its third largest bank , banco popular , is proving to be a " monster when it comes to returns , " kissenkötter said .
according to the financial daily handelsblatt , banco popular has an income-to-equity ratio of 37 percent .
its cost-income ratio for 2005 is estimated to come in at 33 percent .
for germany 's postbank , that figure is forecast to be 71.7 percent .

" we had to go with what the market was telling us and the market is always right , " klaus zumwinkel , the ceo of postbank 's parent company , deutsche post , told reporters on sunday .
he added that a couple of days of postponement for the public offering surely did n't make a difference after years of preparing the move . company officials are expected to raise about € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- with the initial public offering - € 400 million less than they had hoped for to reduce debt and expand postbank 's distribution network in europe . postbank will sell two-thirds of the 82 million postbank shares to the public in addition to offering a € 1 billion convertible bond issued by deutsche post that will pay between 2 and 3 percent interest and can be exchanged for shares in three years , bloomberg reported . speculation about the success or failure of postbank 's public debut has been rife and the road to the ipo has been anything but smooth .
there have been leaked memos , accusations of overpricing , scathing media reports decrying germany 's financial community as a bunch of gossips whose favorite activity is preaching defeatism , especially when it comes to financial markets .
the rumor mill has only been picking up speed as the big day approaches . but despite the criticism of a very sloppy preparation for this important stock market debut , which many hope will revive the country 's moribund shareholder culture , the bank floatation has potential and a good many analysts and small investors think it could succeed .
however , competition in europe is intense and postbank will have to prove itself before it fully gains the confidence of the financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank headquarters in bonn as a private bank , postbank , germany 's largest retail bank by customers , can hold its own with the nation 's other big banks such as deutsche bank , dresdner bank und commerzbank . but its real direct competitors are outside germany 's borders : banco popular in spain , italy 's unicredito , austria 's erste bank , svenska handelsbanken in sweden or the british banks alliance & leicester as well as the royal bank of scotland .
these are all institutions which conduct most of their business in the retail sector . efficient models these banks are largely profitable , efficient and count among the darlings of analysts , who are fond of recommending their stock to clients , especially since the banking sector offers investors deals like never before and the private banks are , as a group , undervalued .
the price-earnings ratio based on 2005 estimates is averaged at just over 10 .
the postbank 's price-earnings ratio is between 11 and 13 . that means as far as profitability goes , postbank trails other european banks .
" the return on equity in low compared to international competitors , " guido hoymann of the frankfurt-based metzler bank told dw-world .
the return on equity at postbank is barely in the double digits .
with english banks , the return lies at around 20 percent in some cases , he said , adding that french banks have a rate of about 15 percent . the three-pillar handicap according to hoymann , postbank 's profitability suffers under the dominance of germany 's savings and cooperative banks , especially since the savings banks control around 50 percent of the retail banking market . experts largely agree that germany 's historical banking landscape , structured around a so-called three-pillar system of private banks , savings banks and cooperative banks is one of the main barriers to a much-needed consolidation of the country 's banking sector .
the dense network of banking branches makes germany one of europe 's most competitive countries .
that intense competition in an already fragmented market hurts profit margins in the credit business .
the result : rates of return are relatively low . european banking champions the view is different in the rest of europe . " in france , 60 percent of the market is controlled by five of the biggest banks , " said jörn kissenkötter , an analyst with m. m. warburg .
in germany on the other hand , the five biggest institutions only have about 20 percent of the market . in italy , one of the country 's oldest banks , banca commerciale italiana , has joined forces with five region savings banks for form unicredito italiano .
while profits have suffered recently , unicredito still counts among europe 's most successful banks . british banks have also been held up as models of retail banking , although according to hoymann , growth potential in this market " looks to be exhausted . " spain has also proved to be a lucrative banking location .
its third largest bank , banco popular , is proving to be a " monster when it comes to returns , " kissenkötter said .
according to the financial daily handelsblatt , banco popular has an income-to-equity ratio of 37 percent .
its cost-income ratio for 2005 is estimated to come in at 33 percent .
for germany 's postbank , that figure is forecast to be 71.7 percent .

no one would spend in excess of € 60 on a soccer shirt if 90 minutes of wearing it resulted in a rash .
just as the modern game requires more from its players , so does it demand more from its equipment .
soccer is a global game and the teams at the top are required to challenge for glory in environments as diverse as the bone-chilling ice fields of the ukraine and the sweltering stadium-cum-ovens of dubai .
kit manufacturers are well aware that teams require equipment which will leave the players to concentrate on just one thing - the game itself .
all of the teams appearing at euro 2004 , regardless of whether they turn out in nike , adidas , umbro , puma or kappa , will be wearing shirts a million miles away from the scratchy uniforms of yesteryear .
with the introduction of moisture management systems such as the play dry technology that keeps the players cooler , drier and more comfortable , soccer is now played in relative luxury .
england calls in rocket scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's wayne rooney can comfortabley raise his arms without fear of scratchy material .
one wonders why the manufacturers of the past never embraced the simple concept of comfort .
it 's hardly rocket science .
except these days , that 's exactly what it is .
the england team has enlisted nasa experts in an attempt to deal with the heat in portugal during the european championships .
the new second strip , which has been developed by sports company umbro in association with u.s. space boffins , is pushing the boundaries in kit design and innovation .
the red shirt is made from 99.9 percent silver weave called x-static and claims to warm the players in lower temperatures and cool them in hot environments .
the manufacturer claims the heat transfer and moisture management system is a first for football and it is hoped that it will pay dividends when employed by england in portugal this summer .
supporters boost shirt profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of german soccer fans wearing their country 's kit .
the companies responsible for kitting out the euro 2004 competitors are not only concerned with developing innovative technology for their clients .
they are also well aware that the 22 men in each international squad will not be the only ones to sport their shirts .
the stadiums of portugal will be filled with fans displaying their countries colors in the stands .
just as the tickly aertex of bygone days is now a thing of the past , thankfully so are the designers who sent their teams out to do battle in shirts which would n't have looked out of place in a garage sale or charity shop .
fashion is a factor that sports manufacturers have finally cottoned onto .
the rise of the soccer shirt as fashion accessory can be charted back to the recent past when giorgio armani designed the italian national team 's shirts for the 1994 world cup .
the styling was typically italian chic and the shirt became as popular off the pitch as on it .
the mid-90 's saw an explosion in fans wearing their team colors on days other than match days as the image of the soccer fan attempted to move away from that of the perma-kitted hooligan .
female interest takes fashion to another level the embracing of the game and the fashions by female fans also took off at the same time and helped to promote the new , changing face of the game .
as a result , companies reported a marked increase in sales to female supporters and now are selling specially tailored women 's replica shirts along side those popular with the boys .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no self-respecting fan would be seen without their team 's colors .
add to this the soaring profile of the soccer star as celebrity and the team shirt has become de rigueur for fans the world over ; for those wanting to show their allegiance , for those who follow the individual icons of the game and those who just like the style regardless if its their team or not .
shirt manufacturers have harnessed the power of the soccer shirt as a marketing tool and an essential piece of modern clothing .
the european championships are seen as a lucrative time for the sports manufacturers .
adidas , the german sports giant that provides the kit for the german , french , latvian , greek and spanish national teams at the tournament , are expecting great things .
adidas hoping for great returns anne putz of adidas salomon told dw-world that , although sales figures for their shirts would not be available until after the tournament , in general soccer accounts for 15 percent of the total sales of the company 's sports division .
she also added that since adidas started producing soccer clothing in 1972 , teams wearing the company 's shirts have won all but one european championship .
with the popularity of the soccer shirt now assured and the advances in kit production , the 2004 european championships are likely to be the most fashionable , dry and well-ventilated on record for players and supporters alike . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

picture a windy day on an exposed cattle field in november sometime in the 1970 's or 1980 's .
the coveted ball swirls in the growing tempest as two amateur teams contest for supremacy in conditions more akin to the battlefields of flanders .
the rain turns to hail as the referee 's whistle brings the latest ordeal to a close .
after such a game , the overwhelming feeling would not be of ecstasy at the victory or despair at the loss but the rather sore and exposed stinging of irritated skin .
because in those days , the shirts on the players ' backs were worn only to determine one team from the other , not to provide comfort or make a fashion statement .
they were not even intended to protect players from the elements .
rough materials which rubbed the flesh raw , collars so wide and pointed they needed corks on the end to prevent eye injuries and shorts so tight it was debatable whether the men who wore them would ever get a chance to enjoy the sport with their offspring .
this was the harsh and often painful reality of soccer kits in the age before commercialism took hold in the game .
fabric technology offers comfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack wears the new germany shirt on display in portugal .
in these days of breathable , lightweight fabrics , the idea of pulling on your team 's colors and getting the clothing equivalent of thirty lashes will be totally alien to anyone whose only experience of soccer shirts will be the smooth glide of silky , temperature controlling polyester .
no one would spend in excess of € 60 on a soccer shirt if 90 minutes of wearing it resulted in a rash .
just as the modern game requires more from its players , so does it demand more from its equipment .
soccer is a global game and the teams at the top are required to challenge for glory in environments as diverse as the bone-chilling ice fields of the ukraine and the sweltering stadium-cum-ovens of dubai .
kit manufacturers are well aware that teams require equipment which will leave the players to concentrate on just one thing - the game itself .
all of the teams appearing at euro 2004 , regardless of whether they turn out in nike , adidas , umbro , puma or kappa , will be wearing shirts a million miles away from the scratchy uniforms of yesteryear .
with the introduction of moisture management systems such as the play dry technology that keeps the players cooler , drier and more comfortable , soccer is now played in relative luxury .
england calls in rocket scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's wayne rooney can comfortabley raise his arms without fear of scratchy material .
one wonders why the manufacturers of the past never embraced the simple concept of comfort .
it 's hardly rocket science .
except these days , that 's exactly what it is .
the england team has enlisted nasa experts in an attempt to deal with the heat in portugal during the european championships .
the new second strip , which has been developed by sports company umbro in association with u.s. space boffins , is pushing the boundaries in kit design and innovation .
the red shirt is made from 99.9 percent silver weave called x-static and claims to warm the players in lower temperatures and cool them in hot environments .
the manufacturer claims the heat transfer and moisture management system is a first for football and it is hoped that it will pay dividends when employed by england in portugal this summer .
supporters boost shirt profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of german soccer fans wearing their country 's kit .
the companies responsible for kitting out the euro 2004 competitors are not only concerned with developing innovative technology for their clients .
they are also well aware that the 22 men in each international squad will not be the only ones to sport their shirts .
the stadiums of portugal will be filled with fans displaying their countries colors in the stands .
just as the tickly aertex of bygone days is now a thing of the past , thankfully so are the designers who sent their teams out to do battle in shirts which would n't have looked out of place in a garage sale or charity shop .
fashion is a factor that sports manufacturers have finally cottoned onto .
the rise of the soccer shirt as fashion accessory can be charted back to the recent past when giorgio armani designed the italian national team 's shirts for the 1994 world cup .
the styling was typically italian chic and the shirt became as popular off the pitch as on it .
the mid-90 's saw an explosion in fans wearing their team colors on days other than match days as the image of the soccer fan attempted to move away from that of the perma-kitted hooligan .
female interest takes fashion to another level the embracing of the game and the fashions by female fans also took off at the same time and helped to promote the new , changing face of the game .
as a result , companies reported a marked increase in sales to female supporters and now are selling specially tailored women 's replica shirts along side those popular with the boys .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no self-respecting fan would be seen without their team 's colors .
add to this the soaring profile of the soccer star as celebrity and the team shirt has become de rigueur for fans the world over ; for those wanting to show their allegiance , for those who follow the individual icons of the game and those who just like the style regardless if its their team or not .
shirt manufacturers have harnessed the power of the soccer shirt as a marketing tool and an essential piece of modern clothing .
the european championships are seen as a lucrative time for the sports manufacturers .
adidas , the german sports giant that provides the kit for the german , french , latvian , greek and spanish national teams at the tournament , are expecting great things .
adidas hoping for great returns anne putz of adidas salomon told dw-world that , although sales figures for their shirts would not be available until after the tournament , in general soccer accounts for 15 percent of the total sales of the company 's sports division .
she also added that since adidas started producing soccer clothing in 1972 , teams wearing the company 's shirts have won all but one european championship .
with the popularity of the soccer shirt now assured and the advances in kit production , the 2004 european championships are likely to be the most fashionable , dry and well-ventilated on record for players and supporters alike . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live discover germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.06.2004 postbank public offering goes ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying the course despite the delay : post ceo klaus zumwinkel in germany 's biggest public offering in four years , postbank is set to begin selling shares on the stock market with a slight delay wednesday after lowering the share price to respond to a lack of interest from buyers . postbank officials on saturday announced that they would postpone the initial public offering from monday to wednesday and lower the share price from between € 31.50 -lrb- $ 37.90 -rrb- and 36.50 to between € 28 and € 32 . " we had to go with what the market was telling us and the market is always right , " klaus zumwinkel , the ceo of postbank 's parent company , deutsche post , told reporters on sunday .
he added that a couple of days of postponement for the public offering surely did n't make a difference after years of preparing the move . company officials are expected to raise about € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- with the initial public offering - € 400 million less than they had hoped for to reduce debt and expand postbank 's distribution network in europe . postbank will sell two-thirds of the 82 million postbank shares to the public in addition to offering a € 1 billion convertible bond issued by deutsche post that will pay between 2 and 3 percent interest and can be exchanged for shares in three years , bloomberg reported . speculation about the success or failure of postbank 's public debut has been rife and the road to the ipo has been anything but smooth .
there have been leaked memos , accusations of overpricing , scathing media reports decrying germany 's financial community as a bunch of gossips whose favorite activity is preaching defeatism , especially when it comes to financial markets .
the rumor mill has only been picking up speed as the big day approaches . but despite the criticism of a very sloppy preparation for this important stock market debut , which many hope will revive the country 's moribund shareholder culture , the bank floatation has potential and a good many analysts and small investors think it could succeed .
however , competition in europe is intense and postbank will have to prove itself before it fully gains the confidence of the financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank headquarters in bonn as a private bank , postbank , germany 's largest retail bank by customers , can hold its own with the nation 's other big banks such as deutsche bank , dresdner bank und commerzbank . but its real direct competitors are outside germany 's borders : banco popular in spain , italy 's unicredito , austria 's erste bank , svenska handelsbanken in sweden or the british banks alliance & leicester as well as the royal bank of scotland .
these are all institutions which conduct most of their business in the retail sector . efficient models these banks are largely profitable , efficient and count among the darlings of analysts , who are fond of recommending their stock to clients , especially since the banking sector offers investors deals like never before and the private banks are , as a group , undervalued .
the price-earnings ratio based on 2005 estimates is averaged at just over 10 .
the postbank 's price-earnings ratio is between 11 and 13 . that means as far as profitability goes , postbank trails other european banks .
" the return on equity in low compared to international competitors , " guido hoymann of the frankfurt-based metzler bank told dw-world .
the return on equity at postbank is barely in the double digits .
with english banks , the return lies at around 20 percent in some cases , he said , adding that french banks have a rate of about 15 percent . the three-pillar handicap according to hoymann , postbank 's profitability suffers under the dominance of germany 's savings and cooperative banks , especially since the savings banks control around 50 percent of the retail banking market . experts largely agree that germany 's historical banking landscape , structured around a so-called three-pillar system of private banks , savings banks and cooperative banks is one of the main barriers to a much-needed consolidation of the country 's banking sector .
the dense network of banking branches makes germany one of europe 's most competitive countries .
that intense competition in an already fragmented market hurts profit margins in the credit business .
the result : rates of return are relatively low . european banking champions the view is different in the rest of europe . " in france , 60 percent of the market is controlled by five of the biggest banks , " said jörn kissenkötter , an analyst with m. m. warburg .
in germany on the other hand , the five biggest institutions only have about 20 percent of the market . in italy , one of the country 's oldest banks , banca commerciale italiana , has joined forces with five region savings banks for form unicredito italiano .
while profits have suffered recently , unicredito still counts among europe 's most successful banks . british banks have also been held up as models of retail banking , although according to hoymann , growth potential in this market " looks to be exhausted . " spain has also proved to be a lucrative banking location .
its third largest bank , banco popular , is proving to be a " monster when it comes to returns , " kissenkötter said .
according to the financial daily handelsblatt , banco popular has an income-to-equity ratio of 37 percent .
its cost-income ratio for 2005 is estimated to come in at 33 percent .
for germany 's postbank , that figure is forecast to be 71.7 percent .
part of banco popular 's success , according to kissenkötter , has to do with the spanish economy , which is enjoying a boom in the real estate market . postbank in pretty good shape banker hoymann is not ready to take part in the widespread scepticism about postbank 's stock market debut .
" there are good possibilities , " he said .
" after all , the bank has 11.5 million customers . " moreover , the bank has more in deposits than it does in loans paid out and is seen by analysts to be more resistant to future banking crises than big players like deutsche bank , commerzbank or hypovereinsbank .
the other big guys have focused largely on investment banking and neglected the retail sector to their disadvantage .
the stock market has been flat ; the private customer has suddenly become interesting again . steffen leidel -lrb- jam / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank sticks with ipo , rules out sale to deutsche bank deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .

german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .

the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .

germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .
but kolinko seemed untroubled by the optimistic high balls that constituted germany 's shots on goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 91 minutes on the clock , miroslav klose could have sewn the game up with a free header with only kolinko to beat but his diving effort flew embarrassingly wide .
there was barely any time for klose to hide his face before the final whistle sounded and germany left the pitch to face the criticism which will surely follow this upset . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler hopes to navigate potential latvian pitfall germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .

the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .
since sevestre only has her father 's first name - no family name or rank - the german archives service hasn ’ t been able to help her .
but she ’ s not giving up hope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as she looks through the few photos she has of her mother and herself as a child , sevestre takes comfort in the fact she no longer feels alone .

she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .
since sevestre only has her father 's first name - no family name or rank - the german archives service hasn ’ t been able to help her .
but she ’ s not giving up hope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as she looks through the few photos she has of her mother and herself as a child , sevestre takes comfort in the fact she no longer feels alone .
thanks to the book project , she has been in touch with many other children of german soldiers .
they often share the same childhood stories of mistreatment and shame .
however , there is strength in numbers and they talk of forming an association for children of the war . geneviève oger -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in pomp-filled ceremonies , europe remembers d-day george w. bush , jacques chirac and other european leaders gather to commemorate d-day .

libyan officials negotiating compensation to victims of a 1986 bomb attack in berlin are demanding money for victims of german world war ii mines as well as the extradition of libyan opposition members . hussin akeel , one of the libyan negotiators , said meeting the demands would " positively influence " the talks , according to german news magazine focus . the demands came as a surprise to german lawyers for the more than 160 non-american victims of the attack on berlin 's " la belle " nightclub , which killed two american soldiers and a turkish woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle nightclub after the attack a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service had planned the attack and sentenced four people to long prison terms .

the money , potentially as much as $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.2 million -rrb- , is expected to come from the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . gadhafi needs an agreement on the matter in order for libya to be admitted to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .
holland : van der sar ; heitinga , bouma , stam , van bronckhorst ; seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , robben , van nistelrooy .

" we had to go with what the market was telling us and the market is always right , " klaus zumwinkel , the ceo of postbank 's parent company , deutsche post , told reporters on sunday .
he added that a couple of days of postponement for the public offering surely did n't make a difference after years of preparing the move . company officials are expected to raise about € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- with the initial public offering - € 400 million less than they had hoped for to reduce debt and expand postbank 's distribution network in europe . postbank will sell two-thirds of the 82 million postbank shares to the public in addition to offering a € 1 billion convertible bond issued by deutsche post that will pay between 2 and 3 percent interest and can be exchanged for shares in three years , bloomberg reported . speculation about the success or failure of postbank 's public debut has been rife and the road to the ipo has been anything but smooth .
there have been leaked memos , accusations of overpricing , scathing media reports decrying germany 's financial community as a bunch of gossips whose favorite activity is preaching defeatism , especially when it comes to financial markets .
the rumor mill has only been picking up speed as the big day approaches . but despite the criticism of a very sloppy preparation for this important stock market debut , which many hope will revive the country 's moribund shareholder culture , the bank floatation has potential and a good many analysts and small investors think it could succeed .
however , competition in europe is intense and postbank will have to prove itself before it fully gains the confidence of the financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank headquarters in bonn as a private bank , postbank , germany 's largest retail bank by customers , can hold its own with the nation 's other big banks such as deutsche bank , dresdner bank und commerzbank . but its real direct competitors are outside germany 's borders : banco popular in spain , italy 's unicredito , austria 's erste bank , svenska handelsbanken in sweden or the british banks alliance & leicester as well as the royal bank of scotland .
these are all institutions which conduct most of their business in the retail sector . efficient models these banks are largely profitable , efficient and count among the darlings of analysts , who are fond of recommending their stock to clients , especially since the banking sector offers investors deals like never before and the private banks are , as a group , undervalued .
the price-earnings ratio based on 2005 estimates is averaged at just over 10 .
the postbank 's price-earnings ratio is between 11 and 13 . that means as far as profitability goes , postbank trails other european banks .
" the return on equity in low compared to international competitors , " guido hoymann of the frankfurt-based metzler bank told dw-world .
the return on equity at postbank is barely in the double digits .
with english banks , the return lies at around 20 percent in some cases , he said , adding that french banks have a rate of about 15 percent . the three-pillar handicap according to hoymann , postbank 's profitability suffers under the dominance of germany 's savings and cooperative banks , especially since the savings banks control around 50 percent of the retail banking market . experts largely agree that germany 's historical banking landscape , structured around a so-called three-pillar system of private banks , savings banks and cooperative banks is one of the main barriers to a much-needed consolidation of the country 's banking sector .
the dense network of banking branches makes germany one of europe 's most competitive countries .
that intense competition in an already fragmented market hurts profit margins in the credit business .
the result : rates of return are relatively low . european banking champions the view is different in the rest of europe . " in france , 60 percent of the market is controlled by five of the biggest banks , " said jörn kissenkötter , an analyst with m. m. warburg .
in germany on the other hand , the five biggest institutions only have about 20 percent of the market . in italy , one of the country 's oldest banks , banca commerciale italiana , has joined forces with five region savings banks for form unicredito italiano .
while profits have suffered recently , unicredito still counts among europe 's most successful banks . british banks have also been held up as models of retail banking , although according to hoymann , growth potential in this market " looks to be exhausted . " spain has also proved to be a lucrative banking location .
its third largest bank , banco popular , is proving to be a " monster when it comes to returns , " kissenkötter said .
according to the financial daily handelsblatt , banco popular has an income-to-equity ratio of 37 percent .
its cost-income ratio for 2005 is estimated to come in at 33 percent .
for germany 's postbank , that figure is forecast to be 71.7 percent .
part of banco popular 's success , according to kissenkötter , has to do with the spanish economy , which is enjoying a boom in the real estate market . postbank in pretty good shape banker hoymann is not ready to take part in the widespread scepticism about postbank 's stock market debut .
" there are good possibilities , " he said .
" after all , the bank has 11.5 million customers . " moreover , the bank has more in deposits than it does in loans paid out and is seen by analysts to be more resistant to future banking crises than big players like deutsche bank , commerzbank or hypovereinsbank .

one wonders why the manufacturers of the past never embraced the simple concept of comfort .
it 's hardly rocket science .
except these days , that 's exactly what it is .
the england team has enlisted nasa experts in an attempt to deal with the heat in portugal during the european championships .
the new second strip , which has been developed by sports company umbro in association with u.s. space boffins , is pushing the boundaries in kit design and innovation .
the red shirt is made from 99.9 percent silver weave called x-static and claims to warm the players in lower temperatures and cool them in hot environments .
the manufacturer claims the heat transfer and moisture management system is a first for football and it is hoped that it will pay dividends when employed by england in portugal this summer .
supporters boost shirt profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of german soccer fans wearing their country 's kit .
the companies responsible for kitting out the euro 2004 competitors are not only concerned with developing innovative technology for their clients .
they are also well aware that the 22 men in each international squad will not be the only ones to sport their shirts .
the stadiums of portugal will be filled with fans displaying their countries colors in the stands .
just as the tickly aertex of bygone days is now a thing of the past , thankfully so are the designers who sent their teams out to do battle in shirts which would n't have looked out of place in a garage sale or charity shop .
fashion is a factor that sports manufacturers have finally cottoned onto .
the rise of the soccer shirt as fashion accessory can be charted back to the recent past when giorgio armani designed the italian national team 's shirts for the 1994 world cup .
the styling was typically italian chic and the shirt became as popular off the pitch as on it .
the mid-90 's saw an explosion in fans wearing their team colors on days other than match days as the image of the soccer fan attempted to move away from that of the perma-kitted hooligan .
female interest takes fashion to another level the embracing of the game and the fashions by female fans also took off at the same time and helped to promote the new , changing face of the game .
as a result , companies reported a marked increase in sales to female supporters and now are selling specially tailored women 's replica shirts along side those popular with the boys .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no self-respecting fan would be seen without their team 's colors .
add to this the soaring profile of the soccer star as celebrity and the team shirt has become de rigueur for fans the world over ; for those wanting to show their allegiance , for those who follow the individual icons of the game and those who just like the style regardless if its their team or not .
shirt manufacturers have harnessed the power of the soccer shirt as a marketing tool and an essential piece of modern clothing .
the european championships are seen as a lucrative time for the sports manufacturers .
adidas , the german sports giant that provides the kit for the german , french , latvian , greek and spanish national teams at the tournament , are expecting great things .
adidas hoping for great returns anne putz of adidas salomon told dw-world that , although sales figures for their shirts would not be available until after the tournament , in general soccer accounts for 15 percent of the total sales of the company 's sports division .
she also added that since adidas started producing soccer clothing in 1972 , teams wearing the company 's shirts have won all but one european championship .
with the popularity of the soccer shirt now assured and the advances in kit production , the 2004 european championships are likely to be the most fashionable , dry and well-ventilated on record for players and supporters alike . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live im focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

libyan officials negotiating compensation to victims of a 1986 bomb attack in berlin are demanding money for victims of german world war ii mines as well as the extradition of libyan opposition members . hussin akeel , one of the libyan negotiators , said meeting the demands would " positively influence " the talks , according to german news magazine focus . the demands came as a surprise to german lawyers for the more than 160 non-american victims of the attack on berlin 's " la belle " nightclub , which killed two american soldiers and a turkish woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle nightclub after the attack a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service had planned the attack and sentenced four people to long prison terms .
a federal appeals court is expected to decide on thursday whether the cases have to be tried again . although five rounds of talks had been unsuccessful , german negotiators had kept talking about an " open and constructive atmosphere " and said they expected to reach an agreement in the near future . the amount of money paid to the victims had been the main problem so far as the german lawyers are demanding more money than the libyans are willing to pay .
the money , potentially as much as $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.2 million -rrb- , is expected to come from the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . gadhafi needs an agreement on the matter in order for libya to be admitted to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.06.2004 france 's ' cursed children ' search for german roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has received immense attention in france a new book is shedding light on one of the last taboos of world war ii in france : during the german occupation that lasted more than four years , many french women gave birth to children fathered by german soldiers . for years , these liaisons and the children they produced were the source of great shame for many families .
the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .
since sevestre only has her father 's first name - no family name or rank - the german archives service hasn ’ t been able to help her .
but she ’ s not giving up hope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as she looks through the few photos she has of her mother and herself as a child , sevestre takes comfort in the fact she no longer feels alone .
thanks to the book project , she has been in touch with many other children of german soldiers .
they often share the same childhood stories of mistreatment and shame .
however , there is strength in numbers and they talk of forming an association for children of the war . geneviève oger -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in pomp-filled ceremonies , europe remembers d-day george w. bush , jacques chirac and other european leaders gather to commemorate d-day .

" we had to go with what the market was telling us and the market is always right , " klaus zumwinkel , the ceo of postbank 's parent company , deutsche post , told reporters on sunday .
he added that a couple of days of postponement for the public offering surely did n't make a difference after years of preparing the move . company officials are expected to raise about € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- with the initial public offering - € 400 million less than they had hoped for to reduce debt and expand postbank 's distribution network in europe . postbank will sell two-thirds of the 82 million postbank shares to the public in addition to offering a € 1 billion convertible bond issued by deutsche post that will pay between 2 and 3 percent interest and can be exchanged for shares in three years , bloomberg reported . speculation about the success or failure of postbank 's public debut has been rife and the road to the ipo has been anything but smooth .
there have been leaked memos , accusations of overpricing , scathing media reports decrying germany 's financial community as a bunch of gossips whose favorite activity is preaching defeatism , especially when it comes to financial markets .
the rumor mill has only been picking up speed as the big day approaches . but despite the criticism of a very sloppy preparation for this important stock market debut , which many hope will revive the country 's moribund shareholder culture , the bank floatation has potential and a good many analysts and small investors think it could succeed .
however , competition in europe is intense and postbank will have to prove itself before it fully gains the confidence of the financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank headquarters in bonn as a private bank , postbank , germany 's largest retail bank by customers , can hold its own with the nation 's other big banks such as deutsche bank , dresdner bank und commerzbank . but its real direct competitors are outside germany 's borders : banco popular in spain , italy 's unicredito , austria 's erste bank , svenska handelsbanken in sweden or the british banks alliance & leicester as well as the royal bank of scotland .
these are all institutions which conduct most of their business in the retail sector . efficient models these banks are largely profitable , efficient and count among the darlings of analysts , who are fond of recommending their stock to clients , especially since the banking sector offers investors deals like never before and the private banks are , as a group , undervalued .
the price-earnings ratio based on 2005 estimates is averaged at just over 10 .
the postbank 's price-earnings ratio is between 11 and 13 . that means as far as profitability goes , postbank trails other european banks .
" the return on equity in low compared to international competitors , " guido hoymann of the frankfurt-based metzler bank told dw-world .
the return on equity at postbank is barely in the double digits .
with english banks , the return lies at around 20 percent in some cases , he said , adding that french banks have a rate of about 15 percent . the three-pillar handicap according to hoymann , postbank 's profitability suffers under the dominance of germany 's savings and cooperative banks , especially since the savings banks control around 50 percent of the retail banking market . experts largely agree that germany 's historical banking landscape , structured around a so-called three-pillar system of private banks , savings banks and cooperative banks is one of the main barriers to a much-needed consolidation of the country 's banking sector .
the dense network of banking branches makes germany one of europe 's most competitive countries .
that intense competition in an already fragmented market hurts profit margins in the credit business .
the result : rates of return are relatively low . european banking champions the view is different in the rest of europe . " in france , 60 percent of the market is controlled by five of the biggest banks , " said jörn kissenkötter , an analyst with m. m. warburg .
in germany on the other hand , the five biggest institutions only have about 20 percent of the market . in italy , one of the country 's oldest banks , banca commerciale italiana , has joined forces with five region savings banks for form unicredito italiano .
while profits have suffered recently , unicredito still counts among europe 's most successful banks . british banks have also been held up as models of retail banking , although according to hoymann , growth potential in this market " looks to be exhausted . " spain has also proved to be a lucrative banking location .
its third largest bank , banco popular , is proving to be a " monster when it comes to returns , " kissenkötter said .
according to the financial daily handelsblatt , banco popular has an income-to-equity ratio of 37 percent .
its cost-income ratio for 2005 is estimated to come in at 33 percent .
for germany 's postbank , that figure is forecast to be 71.7 percent .
part of banco popular 's success , according to kissenkötter , has to do with the spanish economy , which is enjoying a boom in the real estate market . postbank in pretty good shape banker hoymann is not ready to take part in the widespread scepticism about postbank 's stock market debut .
" there are good possibilities , " he said .
" after all , the bank has 11.5 million customers . " moreover , the bank has more in deposits than it does in loans paid out and is seen by analysts to be more resistant to future banking crises than big players like deutsche bank , commerzbank or hypovereinsbank .
the other big guys have focused largely on investment banking and neglected the retail sector to their disadvantage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.06.2004 france 's ' cursed children ' search for german roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has received immense attention in france a new book is shedding light on one of the last taboos of world war ii in france : during the german occupation that lasted more than four years , many french women gave birth to children fathered by german soldiers . for years , these liaisons and the children they produced were the source of great shame for many families .
the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .
since sevestre only has her father 's first name - no family name or rank - the german archives service hasn ’ t been able to help her .
but she ’ s not giving up hope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as she looks through the few photos she has of her mother and herself as a child , sevestre takes comfort in the fact she no longer feels alone .
thanks to the book project , she has been in touch with many other children of german soldiers .
they often share the same childhood stories of mistreatment and shame .
however , there is strength in numbers and they talk of forming an association for children of the war . geneviève oger -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in pomp-filled ceremonies , europe remembers d-day george w. bush , jacques chirac and other european leaders gather to commemorate d-day .

" we had to go with what the market was telling us and the market is always right , " klaus zumwinkel , the ceo of postbank 's parent company , deutsche post , told reporters on sunday .
he added that a couple of days of postponement for the public offering surely did n't make a difference after years of preparing the move . company officials are expected to raise about € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- with the initial public offering - € 400 million less than they had hoped for to reduce debt and expand postbank 's distribution network in europe . postbank will sell two-thirds of the 82 million postbank shares to the public in addition to offering a € 1 billion convertible bond issued by deutsche post that will pay between 2 and 3 percent interest and can be exchanged for shares in three years , bloomberg reported . speculation about the success or failure of postbank 's public debut has been rife and the road to the ipo has been anything but smooth .
there have been leaked memos , accusations of overpricing , scathing media reports decrying germany 's financial community as a bunch of gossips whose favorite activity is preaching defeatism , especially when it comes to financial markets .
the rumor mill has only been picking up speed as the big day approaches . but despite the criticism of a very sloppy preparation for this important stock market debut , which many hope will revive the country 's moribund shareholder culture , the bank floatation has potential and a good many analysts and small investors think it could succeed .
however , competition in europe is intense and postbank will have to prove itself before it fully gains the confidence of the financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank headquarters in bonn as a private bank , postbank , germany 's largest retail bank by customers , can hold its own with the nation 's other big banks such as deutsche bank , dresdner bank und commerzbank . but its real direct competitors are outside germany 's borders : banco popular in spain , italy 's unicredito , austria 's erste bank , svenska handelsbanken in sweden or the british banks alliance & leicester as well as the royal bank of scotland .
these are all institutions which conduct most of their business in the retail sector . efficient models these banks are largely profitable , efficient and count among the darlings of analysts , who are fond of recommending their stock to clients , especially since the banking sector offers investors deals like never before and the private banks are , as a group , undervalued .
the price-earnings ratio based on 2005 estimates is averaged at just over 10 .
the postbank 's price-earnings ratio is between 11 and 13 . that means as far as profitability goes , postbank trails other european banks .
" the return on equity in low compared to international competitors , " guido hoymann of the frankfurt-based metzler bank told dw-world .
the return on equity at postbank is barely in the double digits .
with english banks , the return lies at around 20 percent in some cases , he said , adding that french banks have a rate of about 15 percent . the three-pillar handicap according to hoymann , postbank 's profitability suffers under the dominance of germany 's savings and cooperative banks , especially since the savings banks control around 50 percent of the retail banking market . experts largely agree that germany 's historical banking landscape , structured around a so-called three-pillar system of private banks , savings banks and cooperative banks is one of the main barriers to a much-needed consolidation of the country 's banking sector .
the dense network of banking branches makes germany one of europe 's most competitive countries .
that intense competition in an already fragmented market hurts profit margins in the credit business .
the result : rates of return are relatively low . european banking champions the view is different in the rest of europe . " in france , 60 percent of the market is controlled by five of the biggest banks , " said jörn kissenkötter , an analyst with m. m. warburg .
in germany on the other hand , the five biggest institutions only have about 20 percent of the market . in italy , one of the country 's oldest banks , banca commerciale italiana , has joined forces with five region savings banks for form unicredito italiano .
while profits have suffered recently , unicredito still counts among europe 's most successful banks . british banks have also been held up as models of retail banking , although according to hoymann , growth potential in this market " looks to be exhausted . " spain has also proved to be a lucrative banking location .
its third largest bank , banco popular , is proving to be a " monster when it comes to returns , " kissenkötter said .
according to the financial daily handelsblatt , banco popular has an income-to-equity ratio of 37 percent .
its cost-income ratio for 2005 is estimated to come in at 33 percent .
for germany 's postbank , that figure is forecast to be 71.7 percent .
part of banco popular 's success , according to kissenkötter , has to do with the spanish economy , which is enjoying a boom in the real estate market . postbank in pretty good shape banker hoymann is not ready to take part in the widespread scepticism about postbank 's stock market debut .
" there are good possibilities , " he said .
" after all , the bank has 11.5 million customers . " moreover , the bank has more in deposits than it does in loans paid out and is seen by analysts to be more resistant to future banking crises than big players like deutsche bank , commerzbank or hypovereinsbank .
the other big guys have focused largely on investment banking and neglected the retail sector to their disadvantage .
the stock market has been flat ; the private customer has suddenly become interesting again . steffen leidel -lrb- jam / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank sticks with ipo , rules out sale to deutsche bank deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank .

the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .
since sevestre only has her father 's first name - no family name or rank - the german archives service hasn ’ t been able to help her .
but she ’ s not giving up hope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as she looks through the few photos she has of her mother and herself as a child , sevestre takes comfort in the fact she no longer feels alone .
thanks to the book project , she has been in touch with many other children of german soldiers .
they often share the same childhood stories of mistreatment and shame .
however , there is strength in numbers and they talk of forming an association for children of the war . geneviève oger -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in pomp-filled ceremonies , europe remembers d-day george w. bush , jacques chirac and other european leaders gather to commemorate d-day .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .

the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .
since sevestre only has her father 's first name - no family name or rank - the german archives service hasn ’ t been able to help her .
but she ’ s not giving up hope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as she looks through the few photos she has of her mother and herself as a child , sevestre takes comfort in the fact she no longer feels alone .
thanks to the book project , she has been in touch with many other children of german soldiers .
they often share the same childhood stories of mistreatment and shame .
however , there is strength in numbers and they talk of forming an association for children of the war . geneviève oger -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in pomp-filled ceremonies , europe remembers d-day george w. bush , jacques chirac and other european leaders gather to commemorate d-day .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

libyan officials negotiating compensation to victims of a 1986 bomb attack in berlin are demanding money for victims of german world war ii mines as well as the extradition of libyan opposition members . hussin akeel , one of the libyan negotiators , said meeting the demands would " positively influence " the talks , according to german news magazine focus . the demands came as a surprise to german lawyers for the more than 160 non-american victims of the attack on berlin 's " la belle " nightclub , which killed two american soldiers and a turkish woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle nightclub after the attack a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service had planned the attack and sentenced four people to long prison terms .
a federal appeals court is expected to decide on thursday whether the cases have to be tried again . although five rounds of talks had been unsuccessful , german negotiators had kept talking about an " open and constructive atmosphere " and said they expected to reach an agreement in the near future . the amount of money paid to the victims had been the main problem so far as the german lawyers are demanding more money than the libyans are willing to pay .
the money , potentially as much as $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.2 million -rrb- , is expected to come from the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . gadhafi needs an agreement on the matter in order for libya to be admitted to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .
holland : van der sar ; heitinga , bouma , stam , van bronckhorst ; seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , robben , van nistelrooy .
subs : westerveld , waterreus , reiziger , kluivert , van der vaart , bosvelt , de boer , makaay , overmars , sneijder , van hooijdonk , zenden .

libyan officials negotiating compensation to victims of a 1986 bomb attack in berlin are demanding money for victims of german world war ii mines as well as the extradition of libyan opposition members . hussin akeel , one of the libyan negotiators , said meeting the demands would " positively influence " the talks , according to german news magazine focus . the demands came as a surprise to german lawyers for the more than 160 non-american victims of the attack on berlin 's " la belle " nightclub , which killed two american soldiers and a turkish woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle nightclub after the attack a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service had planned the attack and sentenced four people to long prison terms .
a federal appeals court is expected to decide on thursday whether the cases have to be tried again . although five rounds of talks had been unsuccessful , german negotiators had kept talking about an " open and constructive atmosphere " and said they expected to reach an agreement in the near future . the amount of money paid to the victims had been the main problem so far as the german lawyers are demanding more money than the libyans are willing to pay .
the money , potentially as much as $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.2 million -rrb- , is expected to come from the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . gadhafi needs an agreement on the matter in order for libya to be admitted to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .

there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .

libyan officials negotiating compensation to victims of a 1986 bomb attack in berlin are demanding money for victims of german world war ii mines as well as the extradition of libyan opposition members . hussin akeel , one of the libyan negotiators , said meeting the demands would " positively influence " the talks , according to german news magazine focus . the demands came as a surprise to german lawyers for the more than 160 non-american victims of the attack on berlin 's " la belle " nightclub , which killed two american soldiers and a turkish woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle nightclub after the attack a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service had planned the attack and sentenced four people to long prison terms .

the money , potentially as much as $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.2 million -rrb- , is expected to come from the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . gadhafi needs an agreement on the matter in order for libya to be admitted to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries .

libyan officials negotiating compensation to victims of a 1986 bomb attack in berlin are demanding money for victims of german world war ii mines as well as the extradition of libyan opposition members . hussin akeel , one of the libyan negotiators , said meeting the demands would " positively influence " the talks , according to german news magazine focus . the demands came as a surprise to german lawyers for the more than 160 non-american victims of the attack on berlin 's " la belle " nightclub , which killed two american soldiers and a turkish woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle nightclub after the attack a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service had planned the attack and sentenced four people to long prison terms .

libyan officials negotiating compensation to victims of a 1986 bomb attack in berlin are demanding money for victims of german world war ii mines as well as the extradition of libyan opposition members . hussin akeel , one of the libyan negotiators , said meeting the demands would " positively influence " the talks , according to german news magazine focus . the demands came as a surprise to german lawyers for the more than 160 non-american victims of the attack on berlin 's " la belle " nightclub , which killed two american soldiers and a turkish woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle nightclub after the attack a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service had planned the attack and sentenced four people to long prison terms .
a federal appeals court is expected to decide on thursday whether the cases have to be tried again . although five rounds of talks had been unsuccessful , german negotiators had kept talking about an " open and constructive atmosphere " and said they expected to reach an agreement in the near future . the amount of money paid to the victims had been the main problem so far as the german lawyers are demanding more money than the libyans are willing to pay .
the money , potentially as much as $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.2 million -rrb- , is expected to come from the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . gadhafi needs an agreement on the matter in order for libya to be admitted to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries .

the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .

sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .

the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .

sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .

the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .

missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.06.2004 france 's ' cursed children ' search for german roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has received immense attention in france a new book is shedding light on one of the last taboos of world war ii in france : during the german occupation that lasted more than four years , many french women gave birth to children fathered by german soldiers . for years , these liaisons and the children they produced were the source of great shame for many families .
the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .

the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .
but kolinko seemed untroubled by the optimistic high balls that constituted germany 's shots on goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 91 minutes on the clock , miroslav klose could have sewn the game up with a free header with only kolinko to beat but his diving effort flew embarrassingly wide .
there was barely any time for klose to hide his face before the final whistle sounded and germany left the pitch to face the criticism which will surely follow this upset . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler hopes to navigate potential latvian pitfall germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.06.2004 france 's ' cursed children ' search for german roots großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has received immense attention in france a new book is shedding light on one of the last taboos of world war ii in france : during the german occupation that lasted more than four years , many french women gave birth to children fathered by german soldiers . for years , these liaisons and the children they produced were the source of great shame for many families .
the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .
since sevestre only has her father 's first name - no family name or rank - the german archives service hasn ’ t been able to help her .
but she ’ s not giving up hope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as she looks through the few photos she has of her mother and herself as a child , sevestre takes comfort in the fact she no longer feels alone .
thanks to the book project , she has been in touch with many other children of german soldiers .
they often share the same childhood stories of mistreatment and shame .
however , there is strength in numbers and they talk of forming an association for children of the war . geneviève oger -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in pomp-filled ceremonies , europe remembers d-day george w. bush , jacques chirac and other european leaders gather to commemorate d-day .

libyan officials negotiating compensation to victims of a 1986 bomb attack in berlin are demanding money for victims of german world war ii mines as well as the extradition of libyan opposition members . hussin akeel , one of the libyan negotiators , said meeting the demands would " positively influence " the talks , according to german news magazine focus . the demands came as a surprise to german lawyers for the more than 160 non-american victims of the attack on berlin 's " la belle " nightclub , which killed two american soldiers and a turkish woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the la belle nightclub after the attack a german court ruled in 2001 that the libyan secret service had planned the attack and sentenced four people to long prison terms .
a federal appeals court is expected to decide on thursday whether the cases have to be tried again . although five rounds of talks had been unsuccessful , german negotiators had kept talking about an " open and constructive atmosphere " and said they expected to reach an agreement in the near future . the amount of money paid to the victims had been the main problem so far as the german lawyers are demanding more money than the libyans are willing to pay .
the money , potentially as much as $ 40 million -lrb- € 33.2 million -rrb- , is expected to come from the charitable foundation of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . gadhafi needs an agreement on the matter in order for libya to be admitted to an eu partnership program with mediterranean countries .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .
two minutes before half-time , edgar davids teed up a scorching effort from distance that richocheted off the inside of the post and out of danger .
there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

there was no let up in the pace and passion once the game started again after the break .
the czechs came out fighting with koller and nedved both exhibiting outrageous skill to threaten van der sar 's goal within five minutes of the restart .
the dutch reacted in kind by sending ruud van nistlerooy into the kind of position he relishes and his skidding shot was just turned round the post by cech .
two corners later and the czechs could take a breather .
but not for long as they were still search of the equalizer .
the best chance of the opening 20 minutes of the second half came to vladimir smicer who had more time than he realized to pick his spot when found with acres of space in the area .
the liverpool midfielder was left hiding his face after scuffing the opportunity past the post .
baros equalizes in style there was no such embarrassment for milan baros however .
with 20 minutes to go , jan koller chested down the ball on the edge of the dutch area and baros struck a screaming volley which flew high into the left hand corner with van der sar at full stretch .
it was the czech striker 's second goal of the tournament and he 'll struggle to better it in terms of quality and importance .
the dutch were down to ten men after heitinga was controversially sent off after receiving a second yellow for a clumsy clash with nedved jsu a minute after the czech goal .
andy van der meyde nearly restored the dutch lead seconds later but the czech resolve held .
they even may have taken an incredible lead on 75 minutes when pavel nedved 's long range free kick bounced off van der sar into the path of jan koller 's substitute david rozehnal whose toe poke was batted away by the dutch keeper as he recovered .
pavel nedved almost won the game with another chance in the 85th minute with a viciously dipping long range volley that cracked off the cross bar with van der sar well beaten .
the remarkable turn-around was complete with two minutes to play .
baros again drifted inside the retreating defense and laid the ball off to marek heinz who hit it first time .
van der sar parried the ball into the path of karel poborsky who cleverly cut the ball back across the goal for vlad smicer to knock the ball into an empty net to seal an incredible victory for the czech republic and book the first quarter-final spot .

milan baros , the highly-rated young liverpool striker , almost put jan koller in on goal in the first minute only for the giant dormund attacker to sky the chance with no defenders around him and only edwin van der sar to beat .
robben opens up czechs for bouma but it was the dutch that made the very early breakthrough .
playing the czech 's at their own game , a speedy move up the field resulted in a drifting cross from arjen robben to the right of the czech penalty area where wilfred bouma found himself unmarked .
the defender 's diving header was sublimely angled into the far left-hand corner of the net , leaving petr cech rooted to the spot .
hollnad 's promise of an attacking start had produced a 4th minute goal .
three minutes later , the dutch lead could have doubled .
clarence seedorf nearly marked his return to the team with a crisply hit free-kick wonder goal .
the milan midfielder curled the ball round the czech wall from all of 30 yards only to hit the outside of the post .
the adrenalin must have still been coursing through his veins when he picked up the first yellow card a minute later after bringing down czech skipper nedved .
some untidy tackles by van bronckhorst and van der meybe almost provided the czechs with chances to grab a quick equaliser on the 15 minute mark but they failed to make the most of the free kicks .
but on 21 minutes the dutch quickly regained composure and it was robben again who tore through the czech defense on the left flank to deliver another killer cross which ruud van nistlerooy powered home from ten yards with cech flailing at thin air .
holland were 2-0 up and displaying a clinical instinct missing from their previous performance against germany .
koller halves dutch lead the reply came just a minute later .
baros skinned stam on the edge of the dutch area and retained composure long enough to thread a neat ball to koller who lifted the ball over the advancing van der sar to halve holland 's lead .
there was no time to take breath as the game steaked from one end to the other .
one minure jan koller was ruing a missed opportunity to equalize , the next johnny heitinga was forcing a world class save from petr cech after his curling effort looked destined for the top left hand corner .
not to be left out , seedorf sent another rocket just wide from 35 yards and van der meyde flashed his own exocet past a stunned cech from the edge of the area to end a frantic five minutes .
breath-taking action without end just before half time , pavel nedved showed why he is regarded as one of the world 's best players by dribbling into the area in one direction , then the other before rounding van bronckhorst and crossing for koller to backheel his shot just wide .
anyone blinking in aviero was in danger of missing a masterclass as every minute brought incident .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .
but kolinko seemed untroubled by the optimistic high balls that constituted germany 's shots on goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 91 minutes on the clock , miroslav klose could have sewn the game up with a free header with only kolinko to beat but his diving effort flew embarrassingly wide .
there was barely any time for klose to hide his face before the final whistle sounded and germany left the pitch to face the criticism which will surely follow this upset . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de völler hopes to navigate potential latvian pitfall germany face latvia in porto on saturday with the group of death balanced on a knife edge .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .
even so , speculative shots from youngsters lahm and schweinsteiger indicated that while who was enjoying most possession was in no question , germany were running out of ideas as to where that goal would come from .
missed chances cost germany the victory after surviving another penalty claim , this time wörns on verpakovskis , germany tightened the screw , with every ball into the opposing area threatening a winning strike .
but kolinko seemed untroubled by the optimistic high balls that constituted germany 's shots on goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with 91 minutes on the clock , miroslav klose could have sewn the game up with a free header with only kolinko to beat but his diving effort flew embarrassingly wide .

german eyes will now turn to aviero where the dutch take on the czech republic . germany and latvia had everything to play for in the estadio do bessa seculo in porto on saturday afternoon as the last phase of the group of death drew near .
with one game to play after this round , germany was looking for the win which would elevate them above their rivals and the latvians were playing for the points to save their tournament .
the germans showed the kind of steel which they will need if they are to proceed to future rounds against the dutch in their last game and started this match at a high tempo , rampaging down the flanks with thorsten frings showing the power and pace that attracted his new club bayern munich .
the latvians were no slouches either in the first exchanges .
maris verpakovskis demonstrated his close control , weaving through the german midfield within five minutes of the start but like the attacks heading in the other direction from frings , nothing concrete came from the individual skill .
rubins causes germany trouble with pace with 20 minutes on the clock , germany 's initial dominance was starting to wane as latvia grew in confidence .
andrejs rubins showed a clean pair of heels to christian wörns on a number of occassions to drift perilously close to oliver kahn 's goal while the latvian rearguard demonstrated solid resolve when faced with kuranyi and bobic in tandem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germans began to look rattled when first rubins and then korablovs made surging runs at the left flank patrolled by arne friedrich .
the german defender had to resort to strongarm tactics to prevent korablovs getting into the area and was booked for his challenge .
the resulting play almost cost germany dear with igors stepanovs heading the cross to the right of kahn , forcing the german captain into his first significant save .
german attackers lining up for chances the scare woke germany from its mid-half slumber with kuranyi , lahm , bobic and schneider all having credible efforts at the latvian goal .
but the nearest and most serious assault on kolinko 's goal came from michael ballack on the hal-hour mark .
the midfielder made space for himself 25 yards out and pinged a crisp shot off the turf which skipped in front of the latvian keeper , forcing him into a bundled save .
minutes later kuranyi tried a similar thing but this time a frantic punch from kolinko cleared the danger for latvia .
the ecciting ebb and flow of the play from one end to the other continued with latvia obviously unshaken by germany 's attempts on goal .
rubins again showed his pace to finf room to cross but frank baumann cleared under pressure .
best chance covered by kahn then suddenly it was verpakovskis against the german defense .
in a burst of speed that showed the reasoning behind his nickname " the riga rocket , " the latvian striker powered past baumann and homed in on kahn .
with a challenge imminent , the striker struck but the goalkeeper was equal to it and the chance was gone .
the pace continued to be high until the half-time whistle blew and the teams retreated to take breath and prepare for a second half that was taking on even more important significance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany started the second half like a team whose survival depended on the final result .
the early pattern of german pressure broken up with latvian counter-attacks began again with the germans this time fired by the introduction of bastien schweinsteiger and latvia feeding the increasingly impressive pair of andrejs rubens and maris verpakovskis .
penalty claim falls on deaf ears soon verpakovskis was causing problems with his speed again , weaving between two defenders in the penalty area and going to the floor under pressure .
latvia as a whole turned to the referee waiting for the penalty which never came .
as quickly as the calls had died away , germany were threatening again .
thorsten frings had time to set his sights on the edge of the latvian box but his fizzing shot flew inches past the far post and the deadlock remained .
then ballack was next to have a clear effort charged down as the latvian defense continued to absorb and frustrate the german attackers .
technically superior germans lack incision the germans began to show their class with some precision passing but the lack of penetration seemed to be playing into the hands of their opponents .
with every sweeping move that broke down , latvia swarmed forward to leave the majority of the germany team playing catch up from behind .
germany eventually had a gilt-edged chance when fredi bobic found himself with an open goal after a clever clipped pass left the latvians dead .
bobic instead kicked the ground when it looked harder to miss .
it was his last contribution before miroslav klose came on in his place on 67 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensing an imminent goal , the germans set up camp in the final third of the pitch and laid siege to the latvian penalty area .

" we had to go with what the market was telling us and the market is always right , " klaus zumwinkel , the ceo of postbank 's parent company , deutsche post , told reporters on sunday .
he added that a couple of days of postponement for the public offering surely did n't make a difference after years of preparing the move . company officials are expected to raise about € 2.6 billion -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- with the initial public offering - € 400 million less than they had hoped for to reduce debt and expand postbank 's distribution network in europe . postbank will sell two-thirds of the 82 million postbank shares to the public in addition to offering a € 1 billion convertible bond issued by deutsche post that will pay between 2 and 3 percent interest and can be exchanged for shares in three years , bloomberg reported . speculation about the success or failure of postbank 's public debut has been rife and the road to the ipo has been anything but smooth .
there have been leaked memos , accusations of overpricing , scathing media reports decrying germany 's financial community as a bunch of gossips whose favorite activity is preaching defeatism , especially when it comes to financial markets .
the rumor mill has only been picking up speed as the big day approaches . but despite the criticism of a very sloppy preparation for this important stock market debut , which many hope will revive the country 's moribund shareholder culture , the bank floatation has potential and a good many analysts and small investors think it could succeed .
however , competition in europe is intense and postbank will have to prove itself before it fully gains the confidence of the financial markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank headquarters in bonn as a private bank , postbank , germany 's largest retail bank by customers , can hold its own with the nation 's other big banks such as deutsche bank , dresdner bank und commerzbank . but its real direct competitors are outside germany 's borders : banco popular in spain , italy 's unicredito , austria 's erste bank , svenska handelsbanken in sweden or the british banks alliance & leicester as well as the royal bank of scotland .
these are all institutions which conduct most of their business in the retail sector . efficient models these banks are largely profitable , efficient and count among the darlings of analysts , who are fond of recommending their stock to clients , especially since the banking sector offers investors deals like never before and the private banks are , as a group , undervalued .
the price-earnings ratio based on 2005 estimates is averaged at just over 10 .
the postbank 's price-earnings ratio is between 11 and 13 . that means as far as profitability goes , postbank trails other european banks .
" the return on equity in low compared to international competitors , " guido hoymann of the frankfurt-based metzler bank told dw-world .
the return on equity at postbank is barely in the double digits .
with english banks , the return lies at around 20 percent in some cases , he said , adding that french banks have a rate of about 15 percent . the three-pillar handicap according to hoymann , postbank 's profitability suffers under the dominance of germany 's savings and cooperative banks , especially since the savings banks control around 50 percent of the retail banking market . experts largely agree that germany 's historical banking landscape , structured around a so-called three-pillar system of private banks , savings banks and cooperative banks is one of the main barriers to a much-needed consolidation of the country 's banking sector .
the dense network of banking branches makes germany one of europe 's most competitive countries .
that intense competition in an already fragmented market hurts profit margins in the credit business .
the result : rates of return are relatively low . european banking champions the view is different in the rest of europe . " in france , 60 percent of the market is controlled by five of the biggest banks , " said jörn kissenkötter , an analyst with m. m. warburg .
in germany on the other hand , the five biggest institutions only have about 20 percent of the market . in italy , one of the country 's oldest banks , banca commerciale italiana , has joined forces with five region savings banks for form unicredito italiano .
while profits have suffered recently , unicredito still counts among europe 's most successful banks . british banks have also been held up as models of retail banking , although according to hoymann , growth potential in this market " looks to be exhausted . " spain has also proved to be a lucrative banking location .
its third largest bank , banco popular , is proving to be a " monster when it comes to returns , " kissenkötter said .
according to the financial daily handelsblatt , banco popular has an income-to-equity ratio of 37 percent .
its cost-income ratio for 2005 is estimated to come in at 33 percent .
for germany 's postbank , that figure is forecast to be 71.7 percent .
part of banco popular 's success , according to kissenkötter , has to do with the spanish economy , which is enjoying a boom in the real estate market . postbank in pretty good shape banker hoymann is not ready to take part in the widespread scepticism about postbank 's stock market debut .

the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .

" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .

it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .

the children suffered horribly through no fault of their own .
they were treated as pariahs by their communities and often rejected by their own families . but now , france can ’ t seem to get enough of children of the war .
television and radio shows are featuring men and women whose fathers were german soldiers serving in france during world war ii .
their mothers committed what was then called “ horizontal collaboration . ”
it ’ s estimated that 200,000 children were born as a result of these love affairs . all of this comes following the release of a book called “ enfants maudits , ” or cursed children by jean-paul picaper , a long-time newspaper correspondent in berlin and ludwig norz , a german working at germany ’ s wartime archives . picaper said he first became interested in the topic in 1995 , when he wrote a story in le figaro newspaper about the children of american g.i.s in germany .
a frenchman then wrote to him saying there was a similar phenomenon in france . “ this gentleman wrote to me saying there were plenty of children of the germans in france from the second world war and that i should write an article about this , " he told deutsche welle .
" i told him it is not possible to write an article about this , we have to write a book because it is a society phenomenon ! ” picaper teamed with ludwig norz at the german archives , who helped him sort through the millions and millions of world war ii era documents .
the book also includes the personal stories of 15 of these “ cursed ” children . speaking out after 60 years now more than 60 years old , they finally speak out - about their suffering , their shame and in many cases , their desire to know who their father was .
picaper said that meeting them was a very emotional experience . “ they were enthusiastic , " he said , adding that many of the people he met felt relieved after talking to him .
" i was like an angel coming from the sky for them .
it ’ s terrible , when you have something that is very close to their identity , and you can not speak about it .
they had to conceal this .
it was the first time in their lives where they were able to speak about their own problem and many of them didn ’ t know that there were other people who were in the same situation . ” jeanine sevestre is 62 years old .
she prefers to use her maiden name when she speaks about being one of these cursed children .
she lives next to the church in a quiet normandy village , about 70 kilometers away from where she was born . sevestre lives the quiet life of a retiree .
now that her children are grown , her desire to know more about her own family has grown more insistent .
her mother was killed just after d-day , when the hospital she was working in was bombed .
she knows even less about her father . doomed lovebirds she knows he arrived in the village where her mother lived in july 1940 and that he stayed there until dec .
1941 or early 1942 .
" they were seeing each other in the way lovebirds see each others , " sevestre told deutsche welle .
" and that was until my grandfather learned that my mother was pregnant , after which he sent her away . ” all she knows is that her father , whose name was werner , was then sent to the eastern front to what was then the soviet union .
sevestre suspects he died there .
after the war , she was raised as an orphan .
at first she was placed with a nanny .
from ages six to nine she lived in an orphanage before being taken in by an uncle and then by her maternal grandfather .
her grandfather had participated in world war i and took out his anger at the germans on the little girl . “ i was beaten , i was insulted , " she said .
" i didn ’ t know why he treated me in this way .
i didn ’ t know why my grandfather was so mean to me when my little cousins who lived in the same house , were well treated , whereas i was always beaten and insulted . ” jeanine didn ’ t even know her father was a german soldier until the age of 13 , when one of her classmates broke the news to her .
it was a terrible shock , one that left her entirely speechless for about two months . searching for her german roots now sevestre has built her own family , with a husband of many decades , four children and four grandchildren .
but for her , the mystery of her birth remains an unresolved issue . she no longer harbors any shame about her background .
she expects her father is already dead , but she would very much like to find his relatives – her paternal family .
since sevestre only has her father 's first name - no family name or rank - the german archives service hasn ’ t been able to help her .
but she ’ s not giving up hope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as she looks through the few photos she has of her mother and herself as a child , sevestre takes comfort in the fact she no longer feels alone .
thanks to the book project , she has been in touch with many other children of german soldiers .
they often share the same childhood stories of mistreatment and shame .

its importance is that it has been made by relatively small private companies not by the aerospace giants under government contracts , as has been the case with the other craft that have reached space .
spaceshipone uses a hybrid rocket motor which is a mixture of solid fuel -lrb- in this case a form of rubber -rrb- and a gas -lrb- nitrous oxide also known as " laughing gas " -rrb- .
the rocket has been built by spacedev and the rest of the soon to be spacecraft by scaled composites , a company with an impressive aerospace track record .
it was behind voyager , which in 1986 became the first aircraft to fly non-stop around the world without refuelling .
rocket-powered aircraft are nothing new .
in 1947 , chuck yeager became the first person to break the sound barrier in the rocket-powered bell x-1 aircraft .
in 1963 , the us x-15 rocket plane was dropped from beneath the wing of a b-52 bomber , firing its rockets to make a sub-orbital hop reaching 107km -lrb- 66 miles -rrb- and " officially " entering space .
one engine , one pilot spaceshipone is going for the ansari x-prize worth $ 10m .
looking back , prizes have played a major role in spurring feats of aviation .
the ansari x-prize is just the latest .
in the early years of the last century , the uk 's daily mail newspaper offered a series of aviation prizes including $ 50,000 for the first non-stop crossing of the atlantic .
spaceshipone carried a pilot but no passengers on its first journey into space more details the first crossing was made by captain john alcock and lt arthur whitten brown .
they used a modified vickers vimy , a night-bomber with two powerful rolls royce engines .
they flew 3,500km -lrb- 2,170 miles -rrb- in 16.5 hours , crashing into a bog in ireland .
shortly afterwards , winston churchill presented them with lord northcliffe 's prize .
another challenge , another prize .
in 1919 , the frenchman raymond orteig offered a prize of $ 25,000 for a non-stop flight between new york and paris in either direction .
he said his offer was good for five years .
no attempt was made .
in 1926 , he extended his offer and it was taken up by charles lindberg .
yuri gagarin : the first government-funded spaceman many considered that a multi-engined aircraft was essential to fly the atlantic , but lindberg disagreed ; maintaining that the more engines , the more was the risk of failure .
one engine , one pilot , and a lightweight aircraft carrying extra fuel , was lindberg 's solution .
in 1927 , the " spirit of st louis " was built in just a few months .
it incorporated a 220-horsepower air-cooled 9-cylinder wright j-5c " whirlwind " engine .
it was built to run for 9,000 hours - an impressive beast .
two days before lindberg set off two frenchmen attempted to make the journey from paris to new york .
they and their aircraft were never seen again .
lindberg achieved the landing at le bourget field after a 5,790-km -lrb- 3,600 miles -rrb- flight in 33.5 hours .
into space aviation records fell regularly over the next few decades but the next great leap , into space , required a technology other than the internal combustion engine or jet engine .
when the first astronaut - yuri gagarin - went into space on 12 april , 1961 , he sat atop a converted intercontinental ballistic missile .
the x-15 set an altitude record of almost 108km his vostok a1 rocket was a modified ss-6 missile with an extra stage added .
it was fuelled with liquid oxygen and kerosene developing a million pounds of thrust .
it needed so much thrust because gagarin was to go into orbit .
the first american in space - alan shepard on 5 may 1961 - was only going on a sub-orbital trip .
his mercury-redstone 3 rocket produced 78,000 lbs of thrust - all he needed for a trip up to 186km -lrb- 115miles -rrb- .
when the space shuttle first flew into space in april 1981 , it used a combination of liquid-fuelled rockets and two strap-on solid fuelled boosters .
together they developed an enormous 7.8 million lbs of thrust .
spaceshipone is a very different spacecraft from all that have gone before it .
it is the first time that a manned spacecraft will have used a hybrid rocket motor and the first time a person has gone into space without government help .
a new era in spaceflight has arrived .

the hoppings , one of europe 's largest travelling fairs , is taking place on newcastle 's town moor until sunday 27 june .
lessons for the children of fair workers are held every weekday morning in temporary classrooms on the moor .
in the afternoons and evenings , the classrooms are used by the police and st john 's ambulance volunteers .
traveller teacher diane barlow , who organises the hoppings school , said that although attendance in lessons is not compulsory , last year around 80 pupils attended .
she said : " all the pupils are given work packs by their winter base schools , which they study with during the summer months when they travel with their families .

the fake currency - known to intelligence agents as " superdollars " because it is so realistic - is believed to be printed in north korea .
it finds its way into the uk via the russian mafia , with sean garland - who has contacts in russia and north korea - acting as the alleged ringleader of the uk distribution .
the operation in the uk was smashed after a police investigation which resulted in several people being sent to prison .
however , police believe the ringleader got away .
major player he was never arrested or questioned in connection with the plot , although his name was mentioned in court and he is known to us intelligence agencies as someone involved in the passing of superdollars .

he told the programme : " i first heard the name sean garland when it was referred to me in a classified intelligence report as certainly someone who had been involved -lsb- in a counterfeiting plot -rsb- .
" a top secret document says sean garland is suspected of being involved with counterfeiting us currency . "

police evidence from the trial reveals that on 25 june 1999 , terence silcock - who has been jailed for six years for his part in the operation - flew into moscow to close a counterfeit deal .
panorama obtained flight manifests , which detail passenger lists into the city on that day .

the event near dundrennan , in south west scotland , expects a crowd of up to 5,000 when it opens next month .
but jamie gilroy , the local farmer backing the festival , said a new formula for calculating policing fees has given him a financial headache .
the local council is also charging him for an entertainments licence .
" the costs are a fairly thorny subject , " mr gilroy said .
" if we ca n't build up the numbers this year then we are going to have to seriously look at whether we can continue in the future . "
" my pockets are not so deep that i can go on subsiding the festival forever . "
music lovers only the festival was born out of a project for young people in dumfries and galloway .
it was the brainchild of sid ambrose , working with the stewartry music initiative .
" it is really for people who have a passion for music , " mr ambrose said .
he added : " there are any number of festivals springing up just now , but this one is n't about big business .
if we attempted to make it like t in the park we would be doomed . "
instead the festival takes its theme from the cult film the wickerman , which was shot on location in the area , and books a mixture of up and coming and retro bands .
mr ambrose said : " we try to have something for everyone .
last year it was like a gathering of the tribes of british youth sub-culture . "
he added that it is more of a family event than most festivals , with lots of festival-goers happy to bring their children along .
" people behave differently when there are children around , " he said .
headline acts top acts for this year 's event include the buzzcocks and spiritualized , but the festival is also a showcase for upcoming talent .
vocalist chris baillie , who will be appearing with unknown band junkstar from fife , described the festival as " an amazing event " .
he added : " it is a great opportunity for us and other bands who are starting to get known . "
despite the financial problems , jamie gilroy is not in any mood to give up yet .
" i am not looking at it as something to make a lots of money out of , " he insisted .
" what i would like to do is to put the money back into improving facilities and encouraging bigger and better bands to come and play . "
