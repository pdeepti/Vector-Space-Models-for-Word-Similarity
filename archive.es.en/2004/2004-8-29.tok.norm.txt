program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2004 fischer delivers strong message in syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer , left , with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa german foreign minister fischer focused on economic ties between syria and the eu as well as concerns over human rights and weapons of mass destruction in syria during a visit to damascus saturday . as part of an ongoing five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli-palestinian conflict and on economic and political modernization of the region , german foreign minister joschka fischer met with syrian president bashar assad in damascus on saturday . topping the agenda were economic partnership talks that were started in 1998 between the eu and the syria .
fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip . " europe wants to play a constructive role in ending the middle east conflict , he said , " not only because we want to be helpful to you , but also -lrb- because -rrb- these conflicts are related in one way or another to europe 's security .

"
he added , " if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace . " israeli pullout could be breakthrough fischer emphasized that finding a solution to the arab-israeli conflict was key and indicated that an israeli pullout from the gaza strip could provide a answer if it were part of a us-backed peace plan . " we have come to the conclusion that the unilateral withdrawal and the complete dismantling of settlements in gaza , if it 's done in a proper way and part of the roadmap , it could be a real breakthrough to the peace process , " fischer said . he added he would discuss the disengagement plan " to remove all 8,000 jewish settlers from gaza , where they live in fortified enclaves among 1.3 million palestinians , with israeli leaders in jerusalem on monday . palestinians fear the gaza pullout will deny them a viable state in the west bank and gaza because israel has made clear it will hold on to parts of the west bank in return .
israel 's position is backed by us president george bush . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , in amman , jordan on sunday . at the same time , fischer underlined that the european union remained committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " fischer said . a different view from that of the us on america 's invasion and continuing military engagement in iraq , fischer admitted germany still had a different perspective from that of the us .
" the us is our close friend and … most important ally , but i think we have a different view . " the foreign minister said germany remained opposed to sending peacekeeping troops to iraq , but said its contribution included rebuilding the country , providing humanitarian aid and debt relief and training iraqi police . on both iraq and the arab-israeli conflict europe had to play a role , he said .
" if you put all three together , it 's quite clear -lrb- that -rrb- we need american leadership , " fischer said .
" but , on the other side , i do n't believe this can be done alone by the united states . " " europe will play an important role in the quartet , " fischer said , referring to america 's partners including russia , the un and the eu trying to resolve the mideast conflict . iranian nuclear buildup " a nightmare " earlier , fischer also offered his views on a possible iranian nuclear arms buildup , an issue that has dominated relations between tehran and brussels in the past months .
" it would be a nightmare for the region … if there 'd be the beginning of an arms race - a nuclear arms race - in the region , " fischer said . the us accuses iran of using a nuclear energy program to conceal the production of nuclear weapons .
fischer said sunday , europe was looking to head off any dangerous confrontation with iraq .
" we are in intensive talks with iran , and we hope the leadership in tehran would not miscalculate the situation . "

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip . " europe wants to play a constructive role in ending the middle east conflict , he said , " not only because we want to be helpful to you , but also -lrb- because -rrb- these conflicts are related in one way or another to europe 's security .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks .

" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .
the monday demonstrations were originally held 15 years ago during the dying days of the communist regime . widening scale of protests meanwhile organizers of protests against hartz iv are mobilizing people to turn out in larger numbers for the monday demonstrations as well as improving coordination to expand the weekly protests to a nation-wide movement . they are also planning a large procession in berlin on october 2 , a day before german reunification day . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .
-lrb- august 28 , 2004 -rrb- protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip . " europe wants to play a constructive role in ending the middle east conflict , he said , " not only because we want to be helpful to you , but also -lrb- because -rrb- these conflicts are related in one way or another to europe 's security .

"
he added , " if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace . " israeli pullout could be breakthrough fischer emphasized that finding a solution to the arab-israeli conflict was key and indicated that an israeli pullout from the gaza strip could provide a answer if it were part of a us-backed peace plan . " we have come to the conclusion that the unilateral withdrawal and the complete dismantling of settlements in gaza , if it 's done in a proper way and part of the roadmap , it could be a real breakthrough to the peace process , " fischer said . he added he would discuss the disengagement plan " to remove all 8,000 jewish settlers from gaza , where they live in fortified enclaves among 1.3 million palestinians , with israeli leaders in jerusalem on monday . palestinians fear the gaza pullout will deny them a viable state in the west bank and gaza because israel has made clear it will hold on to parts of the west bank in return .
israel 's position is backed by us president george bush . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , in amman , jordan on sunday . at the same time , fischer underlined that the european union remained committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " fischer said . a different view from that of the us on america 's invasion and continuing military engagement in iraq , fischer admitted germany still had a different perspective from that of the us .
" the us is our close friend and … most important ally , but i think we have a different view . " the foreign minister said germany remained opposed to sending peacekeeping troops to iraq , but said its contribution included rebuilding the country , providing humanitarian aid and debt relief and training iraqi police . on both iraq and the arab-israeli conflict europe had to play a role , he said .
" if you put all three together , it 's quite clear -lrb- that -rrb- we need american leadership , " fischer said .
" but , on the other side , i do n't believe this can be done alone by the united states . " " europe will play an important role in the quartet , " fischer said , referring to america 's partners including russia , the un and the eu trying to resolve the mideast conflict . iranian nuclear buildup " a nightmare " earlier , fischer also offered his views on a possible iranian nuclear arms buildup , an issue that has dominated relations between tehran and brussels in the past months .
" it would be a nightmare for the region … if there 'd be the beginning of an arms race - a nuclear arms race - in the region , " fischer said . the us accuses iran of using a nuclear energy program to conceal the production of nuclear weapons .
fischer said sunday , europe was looking to head off any dangerous confrontation with iraq .
" we are in intensive talks with iran , and we hope the leadership in tehran would not miscalculate the situation . "

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .

long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .
the monday demonstrations were originally held 15 years ago during the dying days of the communist regime . widening scale of protests meanwhile organizers of protests against hartz iv are mobilizing people to turn out in larger numbers for the monday demonstrations as well as improving coordination to expand the weekly protests to a nation-wide movement . they are also planning a large procession in berlin on october 2 , a day before german reunification day . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .
-lrb- august 28 , 2004 -rrb- protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .
-lrb- august 25 , 2004 -rrb- east germans vent anger at social cuts public protests against the government ’ s social and economic reforms reached a new peak monday night , as tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in over 30 cities mainly in former communist east germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2004 german group starts " brain gain " effort großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim is to help us-based german researchers find jobs in germany around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .
few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .
and according to schröter , many top-notch scholars do indeed want to return to germany . " if you look at survey data , there are at least 80 to 90 percent of respondents who tell us that they have an interest in returning to germany or to europe if there is a professional option in terms of their career advancement , " schröter said . promoting transatlantic relations the gso has also started organizing conferences in the us to bring together scholars and representatives from german firms and institutes . eckhard schröter admits that the project is still in its infancy , but insists first results are encouraging .
and he makes a point of emphasizing that the german scholars organization is not criticizing the scale of academic exchange between germany and the united states . " quite the contrary , that would give a totally different spin to our organization .
we are definitely in favor of international exchange , " schröter said . " what we want to do is very much promote transatlantic relations - that is at the very heart of our organization .
but we have to make sure is that this exchange does not turn into permanent immigration . " hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting brain gain for german universities leading german education experts have called for more autonomy for german universities to improve competitiveness on an international level .
-lrb- august 16 , 2004 -rrb- stemming the brain drain germany 's largest research institute , the helmholtz association , wants to promote " brain gain " by offering up to € 125,000 -lrb- $ 152,825 -rrb- to 20 recent post-doctorates each year for the next five years .

" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2004 german group starts " brain gain " effort großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim is to help us-based german researchers find jobs in germany around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .
few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .
and according to schröter , many top-notch scholars do indeed want to return to germany . " if you look at survey data , there are at least 80 to 90 percent of respondents who tell us that they have an interest in returning to germany or to europe if there is a professional option in terms of their career advancement , " schröter said . promoting transatlantic relations the gso has also started organizing conferences in the us to bring together scholars and representatives from german firms and institutes . eckhard schröter admits that the project is still in its infancy , but insists first results are encouraging .
and he makes a point of emphasizing that the german scholars organization is not criticizing the scale of academic exchange between germany and the united states . " quite the contrary , that would give a totally different spin to our organization .
we are definitely in favor of international exchange , " schröter said . " what we want to do is very much promote transatlantic relations - that is at the very heart of our organization .
but we have to make sure is that this exchange does not turn into permanent immigration .

" together we ask for their release , " french interior minister dominique de villepin said after meeting with muslim leaders , addressing " all those who have some kind of authority or responsibility for the fate " of the two newsmen . prime minister jean-pierre raffarin cancelled a trip to the south of france to hold urgent talks with de villepin , foreign minister michel barnier , and culture and communications minister renaud donnedieu de vabres early sunday . raffarin was due to preside over a second round of ministerial talks before meeting with french president jacques chirac later in the day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale .
" france taken hostage , " read the front page of the sunday paper le journal du dimanche after the confirmation of the kidnapping of radio france correspondent christian chesnot and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper . headscarf ban " attack on islam " the two men went missing on august 20 , the day they were to have left baghdad for the central holy city of najaf , then the scene of fierce fighting between us forces and shiite militia loyal to radical cleric moqtada sadr . late saturday , arabic-language al-jazeera television broadcast images of chesnot and malbrunot along with an ultimatum from the islamic army in iraq , the same group that killed italian journalist enzo baldoni after kidnapping him . the group gave paris 48 hours to meet its demands , describing the ban on the islamic veil in state schools as " an injustice and an attack on the islamic religion , " the qatar-based network reported , citing its " own sources in iraq . " france 's muslim leaders condemn move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dalil boubakeur , center , head of the french council for the muslim faith , arrives for a meeting at the french interior ministry sunday .
the leader of the french council for the muslim religion -lrb- cfcm -rrb- , dalil boubakeur , said he was " shattered " by the islamic militants ' " unworthy and odious blackmail " .
" the muslim community must set itself apart from these schemes that are reprehensible in the eyes of islam and give no indication that these people are acting in their interest , " boubakeur said ahead of his talks with de villepin . the cfcm is the first officially recognized body for france 's muslim community , which at an estimated five million is the largest in europe .
cfcm vice president mohamed bechari urged the kidnappers to release chesnot and malbrunot , saying the hostage-taking would not help resolve either the headscarf issue or the unstable situation in iraq . editors at the news organizations where the two men work expressed concern about their fate but said they were relieved the pair were alive . french headscarf ban inflames passions iraq 's main sunni muslim religious organization appealed for the release of the journalists , but also called on france to reconsider its decision to ban conspicuous " religious insignia , including headscarves , from the classroom . " in the name of the committee of ulemas we urge the kidnappers to release the two journalists , " said sheikh abdessatar abdelzhawad , a member of the committee , speaking on al-jazeera . the controversial french law , due to go into effect this week when classes resume , prohibits the wearing of " conspicuous " religious insignia - islamic veils , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses - in state schools and universities . the government introduced the law to stop what it saw as an increasingly radical stance by some students to assert their religious identity in schools in violation of a principle that such institutions should be strictly secular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women in indonesia protest france 's controversial government plan to ban muslim head scarves and other religious apparel in public schools .
but the legislation was widely criticized in many countries in the arab world , which charged that it was an example of blatant discrimination against muslims .
demonstrators have marched against the headscarf law in bahrain , egypt , the gaza strip , indonesia , jordan , lebanon and in france itself , where a section of the muslim community campaigned against the new regulation . kidnappings of journalists and other foreigners have become common in iraq as insurgents attempt to force countries to withdraw their troops from the war-ravaged country or extort money . however , both chesnot and malbrunot 's employers and sunni muslim scholars had earlier expressed faith that if they had been kidnapped , they would be safe because france had staunchly opposed the us-led war against iraq . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french parliament votes for headscarf ban in schools an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .

"
he added , " if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace . " israeli pullout could be breakthrough fischer emphasized that finding a solution to the arab-israeli conflict was key and indicated that an israeli pullout from the gaza strip could provide a answer if it were part of a us-backed peace plan . " we have come to the conclusion that the unilateral withdrawal and the complete dismantling of settlements in gaza , if it 's done in a proper way and part of the roadmap , it could be a real breakthrough to the peace process , " fischer said . he added he would discuss the disengagement plan " to remove all 8,000 jewish settlers from gaza , where they live in fortified enclaves among 1.3 million palestinians , with israeli leaders in jerusalem on monday . palestinians fear the gaza pullout will deny them a viable state in the west bank and gaza because israel has made clear it will hold on to parts of the west bank in return .
israel 's position is backed by us president george bush . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , in amman , jordan on sunday . at the same time , fischer underlined that the european union remained committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " fischer said . a different view from that of the us on america 's invasion and continuing military engagement in iraq , fischer admitted germany still had a different perspective from that of the us .
" the us is our close friend and … most important ally , but i think we have a different view . " the foreign minister said germany remained opposed to sending peacekeeping troops to iraq , but said its contribution included rebuilding the country , providing humanitarian aid and debt relief and training iraqi police . on both iraq and the arab-israeli conflict europe had to play a role , he said .
" if you put all three together , it 's quite clear -lrb- that -rrb- we need american leadership , " fischer said .
" but , on the other side , i do n't believe this can be done alone by the united states . " " europe will play an important role in the quartet , " fischer said , referring to america 's partners including russia , the un and the eu trying to resolve the mideast conflict . iranian nuclear buildup " a nightmare " earlier , fischer also offered his views on a possible iranian nuclear arms buildup , an issue that has dominated relations between tehran and brussels in the past months .
" it would be a nightmare for the region … if there 'd be the beginning of an arms race - a nuclear arms race - in the region , " fischer said . the us accuses iran of using a nuclear energy program to conceal the production of nuclear weapons .
fischer said sunday , europe was looking to head off any dangerous confrontation with iraq .
" we are in intensive talks with iran , and we hope the leadership in tehran would not miscalculate the situation . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2004 german group starts " brain gain " effort großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim is to help us-based german researchers find jobs in germany around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .
few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .
and according to schröter , many top-notch scholars do indeed want to return to germany . " if you look at survey data , there are at least 80 to 90 percent of respondents who tell us that they have an interest in returning to germany or to europe if there is a professional option in terms of their career advancement , " schröter said . promoting transatlantic relations the gso has also started organizing conferences in the us to bring together scholars and representatives from german firms and institutes . eckhard schröter admits that the project is still in its infancy , but insists first results are encouraging .
and he makes a point of emphasizing that the german scholars organization is not criticizing the scale of academic exchange between germany and the united states . " quite the contrary , that would give a totally different spin to our organization .
we are definitely in favor of international exchange , " schröter said . " what we want to do is very much promote transatlantic relations - that is at the very heart of our organization .
but we have to make sure is that this exchange does not turn into permanent immigration . " hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting brain gain for german universities leading german education experts have called for more autonomy for german universities to improve competitiveness on an international level .
-lrb- august 16 , 2004 -rrb- stemming the brain drain germany 's largest research institute , the helmholtz association , wants to promote " brain gain " by offering up to € 125,000 -lrb- $ 152,825 -rrb- to 20 recent post-doctorates each year for the next five years .

"
he added , " if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace . " israeli pullout could be breakthrough fischer emphasized that finding a solution to the arab-israeli conflict was key and indicated that an israeli pullout from the gaza strip could provide a answer if it were part of a us-backed peace plan . " we have come to the conclusion that the unilateral withdrawal and the complete dismantling of settlements in gaza , if it 's done in a proper way and part of the roadmap , it could be a real breakthrough to the peace process , " fischer said . he added he would discuss the disengagement plan " to remove all 8,000 jewish settlers from gaza , where they live in fortified enclaves among 1.3 million palestinians , with israeli leaders in jerusalem on monday . palestinians fear the gaza pullout will deny them a viable state in the west bank and gaza because israel has made clear it will hold on to parts of the west bank in return .
israel 's position is backed by us president george bush . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , in amman , jordan on sunday . at the same time , fischer underlined that the european union remained committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " fischer said . a different view from that of the us on america 's invasion and continuing military engagement in iraq , fischer admitted germany still had a different perspective from that of the us .
" the us is our close friend and … most important ally , but i think we have a different view . " the foreign minister said germany remained opposed to sending peacekeeping troops to iraq , but said its contribution included rebuilding the country , providing humanitarian aid and debt relief and training iraqi police . on both iraq and the arab-israeli conflict europe had to play a role , he said .
" if you put all three together , it 's quite clear -lrb- that -rrb- we need american leadership , " fischer said .
" but , on the other side , i do n't believe this can be done alone by the united states . " " europe will play an important role in the quartet , " fischer said , referring to america 's partners including russia , the un and the eu trying to resolve the mideast conflict . iranian nuclear buildup " a nightmare " earlier , fischer also offered his views on a possible iranian nuclear arms buildup , an issue that has dominated relations between tehran and brussels in the past months .
" it would be a nightmare for the region … if there 'd be the beginning of an arms race - a nuclear arms race - in the region , " fischer said . the us accuses iran of using a nuclear energy program to conceal the production of nuclear weapons .
fischer said sunday , europe was looking to head off any dangerous confrontation with iraq .
" we are in intensive talks with iran , and we hope the leadership in tehran would not miscalculate the situation . "
fischer , who has already visited lebanon and syria , heads to israel on monday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers strong message in syria german foreign minister fischer focused on economic ties between syria and the eu as well as concerns over human rights and weapons of mass destruction in syria during a visit to damascus saturday .

" france taken hostage , " read the front page of the sunday paper le journal du dimanche after the confirmation of the kidnapping of radio france correspondent christian chesnot and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper . headscarf ban " attack on islam " the two men went missing on august 20 , the day they were to have left baghdad for the central holy city of najaf , then the scene of fierce fighting between us forces and shiite militia loyal to radical cleric moqtada sadr . late saturday , arabic-language al-jazeera television broadcast images of chesnot and malbrunot along with an ultimatum from the islamic army in iraq , the same group that killed italian journalist enzo baldoni after kidnapping him . the group gave paris 48 hours to meet its demands , describing the ban on the islamic veil in state schools as " an injustice and an attack on the islamic religion , " the qatar-based network reported , citing its " own sources in iraq . " france 's muslim leaders condemn move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dalil boubakeur , center , head of the french council for the muslim faith , arrives for a meeting at the french interior ministry sunday .
the leader of the french council for the muslim religion -lrb- cfcm -rrb- , dalil boubakeur , said he was " shattered " by the islamic militants ' " unworthy and odious blackmail " .
" the muslim community must set itself apart from these schemes that are reprehensible in the eyes of islam and give no indication that these people are acting in their interest , " boubakeur said ahead of his talks with de villepin . the cfcm is the first officially recognized body for france 's muslim community , which at an estimated five million is the largest in europe .
cfcm vice president mohamed bechari urged the kidnappers to release chesnot and malbrunot , saying the hostage-taking would not help resolve either the headscarf issue or the unstable situation in iraq . editors at the news organizations where the two men work expressed concern about their fate but said they were relieved the pair were alive . french headscarf ban inflames passions iraq 's main sunni muslim religious organization appealed for the release of the journalists , but also called on france to reconsider its decision to ban conspicuous " religious insignia , including headscarves , from the classroom . " in the name of the committee of ulemas we urge the kidnappers to release the two journalists , " said sheikh abdessatar abdelzhawad , a member of the committee , speaking on al-jazeera . the controversial french law , due to go into effect this week when classes resume , prohibits the wearing of " conspicuous " religious insignia - islamic veils , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses - in state schools and universities . the government introduced the law to stop what it saw as an increasingly radical stance by some students to assert their religious identity in schools in violation of a principle that such institutions should be strictly secular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women in indonesia protest france 's controversial government plan to ban muslim head scarves and other religious apparel in public schools .
but the legislation was widely criticized in many countries in the arab world , which charged that it was an example of blatant discrimination against muslims .
demonstrators have marched against the headscarf law in bahrain , egypt , the gaza strip , indonesia , jordan , lebanon and in france itself , where a section of the muslim community campaigned against the new regulation . kidnappings of journalists and other foreigners have become common in iraq as insurgents attempt to force countries to withdraw their troops from the war-ravaged country or extort money . however , both chesnot and malbrunot 's employers and sunni muslim scholars had earlier expressed faith that if they had been kidnapped , they would be safe because france had staunchly opposed the us-led war against iraq . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french parliament votes for headscarf ban in schools an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2004 german group starts " brain gain " effort großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim is to help us-based german researchers find jobs in germany around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .
few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .
and according to schröter , many top-notch scholars do indeed want to return to germany . " if you look at survey data , there are at least 80 to 90 percent of respondents who tell us that they have an interest in returning to germany or to europe if there is a professional option in terms of their career advancement , " schröter said . promoting transatlantic relations the gso has also started organizing conferences in the us to bring together scholars and representatives from german firms and institutes . eckhard schröter admits that the project is still in its infancy , but insists first results are encouraging .
and he makes a point of emphasizing that the german scholars organization is not criticizing the scale of academic exchange between germany and the united states . " quite the contrary , that would give a totally different spin to our organization .
we are definitely in favor of international exchange , " schröter said . " what we want to do is very much promote transatlantic relations - that is at the very heart of our organization .
but we have to make sure is that this exchange does not turn into permanent immigration . " hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting brain gain for german universities leading german education experts have called for more autonomy for german universities to improve competitiveness on an international level .
-lrb- august 16 , 2004 -rrb- stemming the brain drain germany 's largest research institute , the helmholtz association , wants to promote " brain gain " by offering up to € 125,000 -lrb- $ 152,825 -rrb- to 20 recent post-doctorates each year for the next five years .

" i am happy with the result but we had some real problems at times , " declared magath . magath rolled out the big guns with brazilian world cup winner lucio and german international torsten frings - bought for a combined 21 million euros - in the starting line-up , but it was deisler who stole the show . " i look forward to every game at the moment , " enthused deisler .
" i really believe we can achieve something this season . " german international deisler , 24 , built on his sterling two-goal display in the 3-2 league cup win over werder bremen with another stellar performance scoring a trademark free-kick for the second goal . deisler missed six months of last season after being diagnosed with depression but now seems to be back on track after a good pre-season . michael ballack broke the deadlock on 22 minutes with brazilian ze roberto backheeling the ball into his path and the german international rifled a shot into the bottom corner . stuttgart vs mainz bildunterschrift : magath 's former club vfb stuttgart also collected maximum points as brazilian marksman cacau netted a hat-trick -lrb- 20,29,78 -rrb- in a 4-2 win over debutants mainz 05 on sunday . stuttgart , now under the guidance of matthias sammer , lie top of the table on goal difference with sv hamburg propping up the rest . reigning champions werder bremen needed a late goal from paraguayan substitute nelson haedo valdez to steal the home win over schalke 04 . ailton vs klose bildunterschrift : the encounter was billed as a duel between brazilian striker ailton - returning to the weserstadion in the colours of schalke - and his five million euro replacement miroslav klose - but it was valdez who snatched the headlines . valdez , 20 , replaced german international klose with 74 minutes gone and needed just nine minutes to have an impact prodding home a knockdown from valerien ismael in the 83rd minute to leave ailton and schalke deflated .

" i am happy with the result but we had some real problems at times , " declared magath . magath rolled out the big guns with brazilian world cup winner lucio and german international torsten frings - bought for a combined 21 million euros - in the starting line-up , but it was deisler who stole the show . " i look forward to every game at the moment , " enthused deisler .
" i really believe we can achieve something this season .

" i am happy with the result but we had some real problems at times , " declared magath . magath rolled out the big guns with brazilian world cup winner lucio and german international torsten frings - bought for a combined 21 million euros - in the starting line-up , but it was deisler who stole the show . " i look forward to every game at the moment , " enthused deisler .
" i really believe we can achieve something this season . " german international deisler , 24 , built on his sterling two-goal display in the 3-2 league cup win over werder bremen with another stellar performance scoring a trademark free-kick for the second goal . deisler missed six months of last season after being diagnosed with depression but now seems to be back on track after a good pre-season . michael ballack broke the deadlock on 22 minutes with brazilian ze roberto backheeling the ball into his path and the german international rifled a shot into the bottom corner . stuttgart vs mainz bildunterschrift : magath 's former club vfb stuttgart also collected maximum points as brazilian marksman cacau netted a hat-trick -lrb- 20,29,78 -rrb- in a 4-2 win over debutants mainz 05 on sunday . stuttgart , now under the guidance of matthias sammer , lie top of the table on goal difference with sv hamburg propping up the rest . reigning champions werder bremen needed a late goal from paraguayan substitute nelson haedo valdez to steal the home win over schalke 04 . ailton vs klose bildunterschrift : the encounter was billed as a duel between brazilian striker ailton - returning to the weserstadion in the colours of schalke - and his five million euro replacement miroslav klose - but it was valdez who snatched the headlines . valdez , 20 , replaced german international klose with 74 minutes gone and needed just nine minutes to have an impact prodding home a knockdown from valerien ismael in the 83rd minute to leave ailton and schalke deflated . " it was really disappointing to lose like that , " said ailton .
" conceding late on really hurts as we played really well . " a power cut had delayed the kick off of the 2004/05 bundesliga season by around 70 minutes but it was worth the wait for the bulk of the 43,000 fans at the weserstadion who hope bremen can build on their league and cup double last season . while wins for bremen and bayern were expected , the first shock of the bundesliga season occured at the westfalen stadium . borussia vs wolfsburg bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund , who had the second best home record last term , fell to a 2-1 reverse against vfl wolfsburg despite taking the lead through brazilian ewerthon on the half hour mark . new dutch manager bert van marwijk saw his first bundesliga match end in defeat as wolfsburg came from behind to notch a first ever win at dortmund thanks to two strikes from thomas bradric . " i am so disappointed , " said van marwijk .
" we had countless chances but could not convert them . " " i can not believe one of them did not go in . " bildunterschrift : another team forced into a comeback was bayer leverkusen who needed a strike from brazilian franca at the death to claim a 2-1 win over hannover at the bayarena . michael tarnat , a recent recruit from manchester city , put hannover ahead with a blistering free-kick on the quarter hour mark but bernd schneider equalised in the 49th minute and franca saved the day .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .
the monday demonstrations were originally held 15 years ago during the dying days of the communist regime . widening scale of protests meanwhile organizers of protests against hartz iv are mobilizing people to turn out in larger numbers for the monday demonstrations as well as improving coordination to expand the weekly protests to a nation-wide movement . they are also planning a large procession in berlin on october 2 , a day before german reunification day . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip . " europe wants to play a constructive role in ending the middle east conflict , he said , " not only because we want to be helpful to you , but also -lrb- because -rrb- these conflicts are related in one way or another to europe 's security .

"
he added , " if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace . " israeli pullout could be breakthrough fischer emphasized that finding a solution to the arab-israeli conflict was key and indicated that an israeli pullout from the gaza strip could provide a answer if it were part of a us-backed peace plan . " we have come to the conclusion that the unilateral withdrawal and the complete dismantling of settlements in gaza , if it 's done in a proper way and part of the roadmap , it could be a real breakthrough to the peace process , " fischer said . he added he would discuss the disengagement plan " to remove all 8,000 jewish settlers from gaza , where they live in fortified enclaves among 1.3 million palestinians , with israeli leaders in jerusalem on monday . palestinians fear the gaza pullout will deny them a viable state in the west bank and gaza because israel has made clear it will hold on to parts of the west bank in return .
israel 's position is backed by us president george bush . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , in amman , jordan on sunday . at the same time , fischer underlined that the european union remained committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .

few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .
and according to schröter , many top-notch scholars do indeed want to return to germany . " if you look at survey data , there are at least 80 to 90 percent of respondents who tell us that they have an interest in returning to germany or to europe if there is a professional option in terms of their career advancement , " schröter said . promoting transatlantic relations the gso has also started organizing conferences in the us to bring together scholars and representatives from german firms and institutes . eckhard schröter admits that the project is still in its infancy , but insists first results are encouraging .
and he makes a point of emphasizing that the german scholars organization is not criticizing the scale of academic exchange between germany and the united states . " quite the contrary , that would give a totally different spin to our organization .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .

the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip . " europe wants to play a constructive role in ending the middle east conflict , he said , " not only because we want to be helpful to you , but also -lrb- because -rrb- these conflicts are related in one way or another to europe 's security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2004 german group starts " brain gain " effort großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim is to help us-based german researchers find jobs in germany around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .
few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .
and according to schröter , many top-notch scholars do indeed want to return to germany . " if you look at survey data , there are at least 80 to 90 percent of respondents who tell us that they have an interest in returning to germany or to europe if there is a professional option in terms of their career advancement , " schröter said . promoting transatlantic relations the gso has also started organizing conferences in the us to bring together scholars and representatives from german firms and institutes . eckhard schröter admits that the project is still in its infancy , but insists first results are encouraging .
and he makes a point of emphasizing that the german scholars organization is not criticizing the scale of academic exchange between germany and the united states . " quite the contrary , that would give a totally different spin to our organization .
we are definitely in favor of international exchange , " schröter said . " what we want to do is very much promote transatlantic relations - that is at the very heart of our organization .
but we have to make sure is that this exchange does not turn into permanent immigration . " hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting brain gain for german universities leading german education experts have called for more autonomy for german universities to improve competitiveness on an international level .

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .
the monday demonstrations were originally held 15 years ago during the dying days of the communist regime . widening scale of protests meanwhile organizers of protests against hartz iv are mobilizing people to turn out in larger numbers for the monday demonstrations as well as improving coordination to expand the weekly protests to a nation-wide movement . they are also planning a large procession in berlin on october 2 , a day before german reunification day . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .

"

few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .
and according to schröter , many top-notch scholars do indeed want to return to germany . " if you look at survey data , there are at least 80 to 90 percent of respondents who tell us that they have an interest in returning to germany or to europe if there is a professional option in terms of their career advancement , " schröter said . promoting transatlantic relations the gso has also started organizing conferences in the us to bring together scholars and representatives from german firms and institutes . eckhard schröter admits that the project is still in its infancy , but insists first results are encouraging .
and he makes a point of emphasizing that the german scholars organization is not criticizing the scale of academic exchange between germany and the united states . " quite the contrary , that would give a totally different spin to our organization .
we are definitely in favor of international exchange , " schröter said . " what we want to do is very much promote transatlantic relations - that is at the very heart of our organization .

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip . " europe wants to play a constructive role in ending the middle east conflict , he said , " not only because we want to be helpful to you , but also -lrb- because -rrb- these conflicts are related in one way or another to europe 's security .

" we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip . " europe wants to play a constructive role in ending the middle east conflict , he said , " not only because we want to be helpful to you , but also -lrb- because -rrb- these conflicts are related in one way or another to europe 's security . " fischer heads to jordan on sunday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer starts middle east tour german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .
the monday demonstrations were originally held 15 years ago during the dying days of the communist regime . widening scale of protests meanwhile organizers of protests against hartz iv are mobilizing people to turn out in larger numbers for the monday demonstrations as well as improving coordination to expand the weekly protests to a nation-wide movement . they are also planning a large procession in berlin on october 2 , a day before german reunification day . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .
-lrb- august 28 , 2004 -rrb- protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 14 years of german unification opinion : a progress report on german unity dispossession of eastern german land illegal , court rules solbes blames reunification for german economic woes communism sunk by the hunk in trunks ? germany -pipe- 29.08.2004 schröder fears protests could erode unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in eastern germany have taken to the streets to protest the reforms chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations . choosing to talk to super illu , a weekly magazine popular in former communist eastern germany , german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was concerned that growing resentment against his labor market reform package was creating a rift between the once-divided states of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , surrounded by bodyguards and journalists , during a visit to the eastern german town of wittenberge .
the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .
the monday demonstrations were originally held 15 years ago during the dying days of the communist regime . widening scale of protests meanwhile organizers of protests against hartz iv are mobilizing people to turn out in larger numbers for the monday demonstrations as well as improving coordination to expand the weekly protests to a nation-wide movement . they are also planning a large procession in berlin on october 2 , a day before german reunification day . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .
-lrb- august 28 , 2004 -rrb- protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .
-lrb- august 25 , 2004 -rrb- east germans vent anger at social cuts public protests against the government ’ s social and economic reforms reached a new peak monday night , as tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in over 30 cities mainly in former communist east germany .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks .

" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .
the monday demonstrations were originally held 15 years ago during the dying days of the communist regime . widening scale of protests meanwhile organizers of protests against hartz iv are mobilizing people to turn out in larger numbers for the monday demonstrations as well as improving coordination to expand the weekly protests to a nation-wide movement . they are also planning a large procession in berlin on october 2 , a day before german reunification day . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .
-lrb- august 28 , 2004 -rrb- protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .
-lrb- august 25 , 2004 -rrb- east germans vent anger at social cuts public protests against the government ’ s social and economic reforms reached a new peak monday night , as tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in over 30 cities mainly in former communist east germany .

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip . " europe wants to play a constructive role in ending the middle east conflict , he said , " not only because we want to be helpful to you , but also -lrb- because -rrb- these conflicts are related in one way or another to europe 's security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2004 fischer delivers strong message in syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer , left , with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa german foreign minister fischer focused on economic ties between syria and the eu as well as concerns over human rights and weapons of mass destruction in syria during a visit to damascus saturday . as part of an ongoing five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli-palestinian conflict and on economic and political modernization of the region , german foreign minister joschka fischer met with syrian president bashar assad in damascus on saturday . topping the agenda were economic partnership talks that were started in 1998 between the eu and the syria .
fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .

"
he added , " if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace . " israeli pullout could be breakthrough fischer emphasized that finding a solution to the arab-israeli conflict was key and indicated that an israeli pullout from the gaza strip could provide a answer if it were part of a us-backed peace plan . " we have come to the conclusion that the unilateral withdrawal and the complete dismantling of settlements in gaza , if it 's done in a proper way and part of the roadmap , it could be a real breakthrough to the peace process , " fischer said . he added he would discuss the disengagement plan " to remove all 8,000 jewish settlers from gaza , where they live in fortified enclaves among 1.3 million palestinians , with israeli leaders in jerusalem on monday . palestinians fear the gaza pullout will deny them a viable state in the west bank and gaza because israel has made clear it will hold on to parts of the west bank in return .
israel 's position is backed by us president george bush . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , in amman , jordan on sunday . at the same time , fischer underlined that the european union remained committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " fischer said . a different view from that of the us on america 's invasion and continuing military engagement in iraq , fischer admitted germany still had a different perspective from that of the us .
" the us is our close friend and … most important ally , but i think we have a different view . " the foreign minister said germany remained opposed to sending peacekeeping troops to iraq , but said its contribution included rebuilding the country , providing humanitarian aid and debt relief and training iraqi police . on both iraq and the arab-israeli conflict europe had to play a role , he said .
" if you put all three together , it 's quite clear -lrb- that -rrb- we need american leadership , " fischer said .
" but , on the other side , i do n't believe this can be done alone by the united states . " " europe will play an important role in the quartet , " fischer said , referring to america 's partners including russia , the un and the eu trying to resolve the mideast conflict . iranian nuclear buildup " a nightmare " earlier , fischer also offered his views on a possible iranian nuclear arms buildup , an issue that has dominated relations between tehran and brussels in the past months .
" it would be a nightmare for the region … if there 'd be the beginning of an arms race - a nuclear arms race - in the region , " fischer said . the us accuses iran of using a nuclear energy program to conceal the production of nuclear weapons .
fischer said sunday , europe was looking to head off any dangerous confrontation with iraq .
" we are in intensive talks with iran , and we hope the leadership in tehran would not miscalculate the situation . "

the leader of the french council for the muslim religion -lrb- cfcm -rrb- , dalil boubakeur , said he was " shattered " by the islamic militants ' " unworthy and odious blackmail " .
" the muslim community must set itself apart from these schemes that are reprehensible in the eyes of islam and give no indication that these people are acting in their interest , " boubakeur said ahead of his talks with de villepin . the cfcm is the first officially recognized body for france 's muslim community , which at an estimated five million is the largest in europe .
cfcm vice president mohamed bechari urged the kidnappers to release chesnot and malbrunot , saying the hostage-taking would not help resolve either the headscarf issue or the unstable situation in iraq . editors at the news organizations where the two men work expressed concern about their fate but said they were relieved the pair were alive . french headscarf ban inflames passions iraq 's main sunni muslim religious organization appealed for the release of the journalists , but also called on france to reconsider its decision to ban conspicuous " religious insignia , including headscarves , from the classroom . " in the name of the committee of ulemas we urge the kidnappers to release the two journalists , " said sheikh abdessatar abdelzhawad , a member of the committee , speaking on al-jazeera . the controversial french law , due to go into effect this week when classes resume , prohibits the wearing of " conspicuous " religious insignia - islamic veils , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses - in state schools and universities . the government introduced the law to stop what it saw as an increasingly radical stance by some students to assert their religious identity in schools in violation of a principle that such institutions should be strictly secular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women in indonesia protest france 's controversial government plan to ban muslim head scarves and other religious apparel in public schools .
but the legislation was widely criticized in many countries in the arab world , which charged that it was an example of blatant discrimination against muslims .
demonstrators have marched against the headscarf law in bahrain , egypt , the gaza strip , indonesia , jordan , lebanon and in france itself , where a section of the muslim community campaigned against the new regulation . kidnappings of journalists and other foreigners have become common in iraq as insurgents attempt to force countries to withdraw their troops from the war-ravaged country or extort money . however , both chesnot and malbrunot 's employers and sunni muslim scholars had earlier expressed faith that if they had been kidnapped , they would be safe because france had staunchly opposed the us-led war against iraq . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french parliament votes for headscarf ban in schools an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2004 german group starts " brain gain " effort großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim is to help us-based german researchers find jobs in germany around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .
few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .
and according to schröter , many top-notch scholars do indeed want to return to germany . " if you look at survey data , there are at least 80 to 90 percent of respondents who tell us that they have an interest in returning to germany or to europe if there is a professional option in terms of their career advancement , " schröter said . promoting transatlantic relations the gso has also started organizing conferences in the us to bring together scholars and representatives from german firms and institutes . eckhard schröter admits that the project is still in its infancy , but insists first results are encouraging .
and he makes a point of emphasizing that the german scholars organization is not criticizing the scale of academic exchange between germany and the united states . " quite the contrary , that would give a totally different spin to our organization .
we are definitely in favor of international exchange , " schröter said . " what we want to do is very much promote transatlantic relations - that is at the very heart of our organization .
but we have to make sure is that this exchange does not turn into permanent immigration . " hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting brain gain for german universities leading german education experts have called for more autonomy for german universities to improve competitiveness on an international level .
-lrb- august 16 , 2004 -rrb- stemming the brain drain germany 's largest research institute , the helmholtz association , wants to promote " brain gain " by offering up to € 125,000 -lrb- $ 152,825 -rrb- to 20 recent post-doctorates each year for the next five years .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .
the monday demonstrations were originally held 15 years ago during the dying days of the communist regime . widening scale of protests meanwhile organizers of protests against hartz iv are mobilizing people to turn out in larger numbers for the monday demonstrations as well as improving coordination to expand the weekly protests to a nation-wide movement . they are also planning a large procession in berlin on october 2 , a day before german reunification day . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks .

" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .
the monday demonstrations were originally held 15 years ago during the dying days of the communist regime . widening scale of protests meanwhile organizers of protests against hartz iv are mobilizing people to turn out in larger numbers for the monday demonstrations as well as improving coordination to expand the weekly protests to a nation-wide movement . they are also planning a large procession in berlin on october 2 , a day before german reunification day . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .
-lrb- august 28 , 2004 -rrb- protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .
-lrb- august 25 , 2004 -rrb- east germans vent anger at social cuts public protests against the government ’ s social and economic reforms reached a new peak monday night , as tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in over 30 cities mainly in former communist east germany .

" together we ask for their release , " french interior minister dominique de villepin said after meeting with muslim leaders , addressing " all those who have some kind of authority or responsibility for the fate " of the two newsmen . prime minister jean-pierre raffarin cancelled a trip to the south of france to hold urgent talks with de villepin , foreign minister michel barnier , and culture and communications minister renaud donnedieu de vabres early sunday . raffarin was due to preside over a second round of ministerial talks before meeting with french president jacques chirac later in the day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale .
" france taken hostage , " read the front page of the sunday paper le journal du dimanche after the confirmation of the kidnapping of radio france correspondent christian chesnot and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper . headscarf ban " attack on islam " the two men went missing on august 20 , the day they were to have left baghdad for the central holy city of najaf , then the scene of fierce fighting between us forces and shiite militia loyal to radical cleric moqtada sadr . late saturday , arabic-language al-jazeera television broadcast images of chesnot and malbrunot along with an ultimatum from the islamic army in iraq , the same group that killed italian journalist enzo baldoni after kidnapping him . the group gave paris 48 hours to meet its demands , describing the ban on the islamic veil in state schools as " an injustice and an attack on the islamic religion , " the qatar-based network reported , citing its " own sources in iraq . " france 's muslim leaders condemn move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dalil boubakeur , center , head of the french council for the muslim faith , arrives for a meeting at the french interior ministry sunday .
the leader of the french council for the muslim religion -lrb- cfcm -rrb- , dalil boubakeur , said he was " shattered " by the islamic militants ' " unworthy and odious blackmail " .
" the muslim community must set itself apart from these schemes that are reprehensible in the eyes of islam and give no indication that these people are acting in their interest , " boubakeur said ahead of his talks with de villepin . the cfcm is the first officially recognized body for france 's muslim community , which at an estimated five million is the largest in europe .
cfcm vice president mohamed bechari urged the kidnappers to release chesnot and malbrunot , saying the hostage-taking would not help resolve either the headscarf issue or the unstable situation in iraq . editors at the news organizations where the two men work expressed concern about their fate but said they were relieved the pair were alive . french headscarf ban inflames passions iraq 's main sunni muslim religious organization appealed for the release of the journalists , but also called on france to reconsider its decision to ban conspicuous " religious insignia , including headscarves , from the classroom . " in the name of the committee of ulemas we urge the kidnappers to release the two journalists , " said sheikh abdessatar abdelzhawad , a member of the committee , speaking on al-jazeera . the controversial french law , due to go into effect this week when classes resume , prohibits the wearing of " conspicuous " religious insignia - islamic veils , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses - in state schools and universities . the government introduced the law to stop what it saw as an increasingly radical stance by some students to assert their religious identity in schools in violation of a principle that such institutions should be strictly secular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim women in indonesia protest france 's controversial government plan to ban muslim head scarves and other religious apparel in public schools .
but the legislation was widely criticized in many countries in the arab world , which charged that it was an example of blatant discrimination against muslims .
demonstrators have marched against the headscarf law in bahrain , egypt , the gaza strip , indonesia , jordan , lebanon and in france itself , where a section of the muslim community campaigned against the new regulation . kidnappings of journalists and other foreigners have become common in iraq as insurgents attempt to force countries to withdraw their troops from the war-ravaged country or extort money . however , both chesnot and malbrunot 's employers and sunni muslim scholars had earlier expressed faith that if they had been kidnapped , they would be safe because france had staunchly opposed the us-led war against iraq . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french parliament votes for headscarf ban in schools an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip . " europe wants to play a constructive role in ending the middle east conflict , he said , " not only because we want to be helpful to you , but also -lrb- because -rrb- these conflicts are related in one way or another to europe 's security .

" i am happy with the result but we had some real problems at times , " declared magath . magath rolled out the big guns with brazilian world cup winner lucio and german international torsten frings - bought for a combined 21 million euros - in the starting line-up , but it was deisler who stole the show . " i look forward to every game at the moment , " enthused deisler .
" i really believe we can achieve something this season . " german international deisler , 24 , built on his sterling two-goal display in the 3-2 league cup win over werder bremen with another stellar performance scoring a trademark free-kick for the second goal . deisler missed six months of last season after being diagnosed with depression but now seems to be back on track after a good pre-season . michael ballack broke the deadlock on 22 minutes with brazilian ze roberto backheeling the ball into his path and the german international rifled a shot into the bottom corner . stuttgart vs mainz bildunterschrift : magath 's former club vfb stuttgart also collected maximum points as brazilian marksman cacau netted a hat-trick -lrb- 20,29,78 -rrb- in a 4-2 win over debutants mainz 05 on sunday . stuttgart , now under the guidance of matthias sammer , lie top of the table on goal difference with sv hamburg propping up the rest . reigning champions werder bremen needed a late goal from paraguayan substitute nelson haedo valdez to steal the home win over schalke 04 . ailton vs klose bildunterschrift : the encounter was billed as a duel between brazilian striker ailton - returning to the weserstadion in the colours of schalke - and his five million euro replacement miroslav klose - but it was valdez who snatched the headlines . valdez , 20 , replaced german international klose with 74 minutes gone and needed just nine minutes to have an impact prodding home a knockdown from valerien ismael in the 83rd minute to leave ailton and schalke deflated .

" i am so disappointed , " said van marwijk .
" we had countless chances but could not convert them . " " i can not believe one of them did not go in .

"
he added , " if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace . " israeli pullout could be breakthrough fischer emphasized that finding a solution to the arab-israeli conflict was key and indicated that an israeli pullout from the gaza strip could provide a answer if it were part of a us-backed peace plan . " we have come to the conclusion that the unilateral withdrawal and the complete dismantling of settlements in gaza , if it 's done in a proper way and part of the roadmap , it could be a real breakthrough to the peace process , " fischer said . he added he would discuss the disengagement plan " to remove all 8,000 jewish settlers from gaza , where they live in fortified enclaves among 1.3 million palestinians , with israeli leaders in jerusalem on monday . palestinians fear the gaza pullout will deny them a viable state in the west bank and gaza because israel has made clear it will hold on to parts of the west bank in return .
israel 's position is backed by us president george bush . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , in amman , jordan on sunday . at the same time , fischer underlined that the european union remained committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " fischer said . a different view from that of the us on america 's invasion and continuing military engagement in iraq , fischer admitted germany still had a different perspective from that of the us .
" the us is our close friend and … most important ally , but i think we have a different view . " the foreign minister said germany remained opposed to sending peacekeeping troops to iraq , but said its contribution included rebuilding the country , providing humanitarian aid and debt relief and training iraqi police . on both iraq and the arab-israeli conflict europe had to play a role , he said .
" if you put all three together , it 's quite clear -lrb- that -rrb- we need american leadership , " fischer said .
" but , on the other side , i do n't believe this can be done alone by the united states . " " europe will play an important role in the quartet , " fischer said , referring to america 's partners including russia , the un and the eu trying to resolve the mideast conflict . iranian nuclear buildup " a nightmare " earlier , fischer also offered his views on a possible iranian nuclear arms buildup , an issue that has dominated relations between tehran and brussels in the past months .
" it would be a nightmare for the region … if there 'd be the beginning of an arms race - a nuclear arms race - in the region , " fischer said . the us accuses iran of using a nuclear energy program to conceal the production of nuclear weapons .

the chancellor said that though there was no real danger of division , there was " cause for concern . " " i make every effort to prevent any form of east-west confrontation , " schröder told the magazine .
" we are one people , we belong together and the east still needs the solidarity of the west , " he said . growing anger over reforms the chancellor 's statements come in the face of signs of growing anger and disillusionment particularly in eastern germany over hartz iv , the biggest labor market and social reforms in germany 's postwar history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors whistle and clap during demonstrations against hartz iv in brandenburg .
surveys show that more westerners than easterners support the reforms .
the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . schröder : reforms wo n't be diluted last week anger boiled over when schröder became the target of egg-throwers during a trip to the east german town of wittenberge .
the incident was repeated during the chancellor 's visit to brandenburg on friday . despite mounting frustration and public ire , schröder said he was convinced that in the long term , people would realize the necessity of the reforms .
then one could have a better dialogue without " monday demonstrations and egg-throwing " , the chancellor said . schröder also insisted that the so-called hartz iv reforms , named after peter hartz , the volkswagen manager who shaped them , would not be watered down .
" showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " schröder said . " spd a party for all people " even chairman of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering said he was against attempts at creating rifts between the east and the west and repeated his invitation to protest organizers against the labor reforms to sit down for talks . " the spd is a party for all the people , " müntefering said after a meeting of top spd leaders in berlin on sunday .
earlier the spd 's party executive strongly endorsed the reforms with the exception of one person . even german foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the junior partner in the governing coalition , rejected accusations that and he and his party had done too little to communicate the reforms and their impact to the people . fischer has announced he is prepared to make an appearance at a monday demonstration in leipzig .
the monday demonstrations were originally held 15 years ago during the dying days of the communist regime . widening scale of protests meanwhile organizers of protests against hartz iv are mobilizing people to turn out in larger numbers for the monday demonstrations as well as improving coordination to expand the weekly protests to a nation-wide movement . they are also planning a large procession in berlin on october 2 , a day before german reunification day . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform anger could turn violent a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior .

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip .

cfcm vice president mohamed bechari urged the kidnappers to release chesnot and malbrunot , saying the hostage-taking would not help resolve either the headscarf issue or the unstable situation in iraq . editors at the news organizations where the two men work expressed concern about their fate but said they were relieved the pair were alive . french headscarf ban inflames passions iraq 's main sunni muslim religious organization appealed for the release of the journalists , but also called on france to reconsider its decision to ban conspicuous " religious insignia , including headscarves , from the classroom .

few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .
and according to schröter , many top-notch scholars do indeed want to return to germany . " if you look at survey data , there are at least 80 to 90 percent of respondents who tell us that they have an interest in returning to germany or to europe if there is a professional option in terms of their career advancement , " schröter said . promoting transatlantic relations the gso has also started organizing conferences in the us to bring together scholars and representatives from german firms and institutes . eckhard schröter admits that the project is still in its infancy , but insists first results are encouraging .
and he makes a point of emphasizing that the german scholars organization is not criticizing the scale of academic exchange between germany and the united states . " quite the contrary , that would give a totally different spin to our organization .
we are definitely in favor of international exchange , " schröter said . " what we want to do is very much promote transatlantic relations - that is at the very heart of our organization .

fischer , who arrived in damascus from lebanon , indicated the two sides had smoothed over the sticking points in the dialogue and were close to finding common ground . " the agreement is important for syria to develop its relations with its european partners , " fischer said at a joint press conference with syrian counterpart farouk al-sharaa .
" there is a great opportunity -lrb- to sign the agreement -rrb- for both syrians and europeans , " fischer said . fischer : wmd clause has to be respected at the same time , fischer stressed that damascus had to agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction - a demand that syria rejected last year - before an agreement promoting bilateral trade could be sealed . " we have an interest in finalizing the association agreement , but for us it is crucial that the clause about weapons of mass destruction will also be accepted , " fischer told reporters after meeting with al-sharaa . last december , the eu commission negotiated a treaty text with syria governing economic relations , but it was slammed by holland , denmark , great britain and germany for falling short of an eu commitment to make the fight against weapons of mass destruction a key plank of ties with third countries . however diplomats say that syria has since changed its position over wmd after it was hit by sanctions imposed by the us in may for damascus ' support for anti-israeli groups .
syria also stands accused of doing too little to secure its border with iraq and for an alleged pursuit of unconventional weapons . " a great opportunity for syria " the agreement negotiations are being conducted with the framework of the euro-mediterranean partnerships set up at the barcelona conference in 1995 between the then 15 eu members and 12 mediterranean partners .
the main aim is to promote prosperity and stability in the mediterranean region . the eu believes that including syria in bilateral relations would promote economic and political reform as well as human rights in the country and prevent if from further isolation .
syria is in need of western funds to modernize its infrastructure and stimulate its economy . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer in damascus on saturday . on saturday , fischer emphasized that the eu clause on syria 's renunciation of wmd would not be diluted , contradicting a statement by syrian counterpart al-sharaa in july that the eu was reconsidering the controversial clause , which he called an israeli demand . " it is for the european union important to reach an agreement about this clause , not to water down this clause , " fischer said .
" i think it is a great opportunity and this opportunity should be used by our counterparts here in syria , " fischer added . " problems with human rights " at the same time , the german foreign minister mentioned " problems with human rights " , an issue which has been underlined repeatedly by human rights groups around the world . " we have an interest in the opening of syrian society , the economy .
we see problems , bureaucratic problems .
we see problems with respect to human rights , " fischer said , adding that europe hoped for significant improvement in the area . calling the talks with syrian leaders " open and constructive " , fischer also said syria could play " a constructive role through supporting efforts to move forward towards peace and for the israelis to withdraw from gaza strip . " europe wants to play a constructive role in ending the middle east conflict , he said , " not only because we want to be helpful to you , but also -lrb- because -rrb- these conflicts are related in one way or another to europe 's security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2004 german group starts " brain gain " effort großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim is to help us-based german researchers find jobs in germany around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .
few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .
and according to schröter , many top-notch scholars do indeed want to return to germany . " if you look at survey data , there are at least 80 to 90 percent of respondents who tell us that they have an interest in returning to germany or to europe if there is a professional option in terms of their career advancement , " schröter said . promoting transatlantic relations the gso has also started organizing conferences in the us to bring together scholars and representatives from german firms and institutes . eckhard schröter admits that the project is still in its infancy , but insists first results are encouraging .
and he makes a point of emphasizing that the german scholars organization is not criticizing the scale of academic exchange between germany and the united states . " quite the contrary , that would give a totally different spin to our organization .
we are definitely in favor of international exchange , " schröter said . " what we want to do is very much promote transatlantic relations - that is at the very heart of our organization .
but we have to make sure is that this exchange does not turn into permanent immigration . " hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting brain gain for german universities leading german education experts have called for more autonomy for german universities to improve competitiveness on an international level .
-lrb- august 16 , 2004 -rrb- stemming the brain drain germany 's largest research institute , the helmholtz association , wants to promote " brain gain " by offering up to € 125,000 -lrb- $ 152,825 -rrb- to 20 recent post-doctorates each year for the next five years .

"
he added , " if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace . " israeli pullout could be breakthrough fischer emphasized that finding a solution to the arab-israeli conflict was key and indicated that an israeli pullout from the gaza strip could provide a answer if it were part of a us-backed peace plan . " we have come to the conclusion that the unilateral withdrawal and the complete dismantling of settlements in gaza , if it 's done in a proper way and part of the roadmap , it could be a real breakthrough to the peace process , " fischer said . he added he would discuss the disengagement plan " to remove all 8,000 jewish settlers from gaza , where they live in fortified enclaves among 1.3 million palestinians , with israeli leaders in jerusalem on monday . palestinians fear the gaza pullout will deny them a viable state in the west bank and gaza because israel has made clear it will hold on to parts of the west bank in return .
israel 's position is backed by us president george bush . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , in amman , jordan on sunday . at the same time , fischer underlined that the european union remained committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " fischer said . a different view from that of the us on america 's invasion and continuing military engagement in iraq , fischer admitted germany still had a different perspective from that of the us .
" the us is our close friend and … most important ally , but i think we have a different view . " the foreign minister said germany remained opposed to sending peacekeeping troops to iraq , but said its contribution included rebuilding the country , providing humanitarian aid and debt relief and training iraqi police . on both iraq and the arab-israeli conflict europe had to play a role , he said .
" if you put all three together , it 's quite clear -lrb- that -rrb- we need american leadership , " fischer said .
" but , on the other side , i do n't believe this can be done alone by the united states . " " europe will play an important role in the quartet , " fischer said , referring to america 's partners including russia , the un and the eu trying to resolve the mideast conflict . iranian nuclear buildup " a nightmare " earlier , fischer also offered his views on a possible iranian nuclear arms buildup , an issue that has dominated relations between tehran and brussels in the past months .
" it would be a nightmare for the region … if there 'd be the beginning of an arms race - a nuclear arms race - in the region , " fischer said . the us accuses iran of using a nuclear energy program to conceal the production of nuclear weapons .
fischer said sunday , europe was looking to head off any dangerous confrontation with iraq .

"
he added , " if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace . " israeli pullout could be breakthrough fischer emphasized that finding a solution to the arab-israeli conflict was key and indicated that an israeli pullout from the gaza strip could provide a answer if it were part of a us-backed peace plan . " we have come to the conclusion that the unilateral withdrawal and the complete dismantling of settlements in gaza , if it 's done in a proper way and part of the roadmap , it could be a real breakthrough to the peace process , " fischer said . he added he would discuss the disengagement plan " to remove all 8,000 jewish settlers from gaza , where they live in fortified enclaves among 1.3 million palestinians , with israeli leaders in jerusalem on monday . palestinians fear the gaza pullout will deny them a viable state in the west bank and gaza because israel has made clear it will hold on to parts of the west bank in return .
israel 's position is backed by us president george bush . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , in amman , jordan on sunday . at the same time , fischer underlined that the european union remained committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " fischer said . a different view from that of the us on america 's invasion and continuing military engagement in iraq , fischer admitted germany still had a different perspective from that of the us .
" the us is our close friend and … most important ally , but i think we have a different view . " the foreign minister said germany remained opposed to sending peacekeeping troops to iraq , but said its contribution included rebuilding the country , providing humanitarian aid and debt relief and training iraqi police . on both iraq and the arab-israeli conflict europe had to play a role , he said .
" if you put all three together , it 's quite clear -lrb- that -rrb- we need american leadership , " fischer said .
" but , on the other side , i do n't believe this can be done alone by the united states . " " europe will play an important role in the quartet , " fischer said , referring to america 's partners including russia , the un and the eu trying to resolve the mideast conflict . iranian nuclear buildup " a nightmare " earlier , fischer also offered his views on a possible iranian nuclear arms buildup , an issue that has dominated relations between tehran and brussels in the past months .
" it would be a nightmare for the region … if there 'd be the beginning of an arms race - a nuclear arms race - in the region , " fischer said . the us accuses iran of using a nuclear energy program to conceal the production of nuclear weapons .
fischer said sunday , europe was looking to head off any dangerous confrontation with iraq .
" we are in intensive talks with iran , and we hope the leadership in tehran would not miscalculate the situation . "
fischer , who has already visited lebanon and syria , heads to israel on monday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers strong message in syria german foreign minister fischer focused on economic ties between syria and the eu as well as concerns over human rights and weapons of mass destruction in syria during a visit to damascus saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.08.2004 german group starts " brain gain " effort großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim is to help us-based german researchers find jobs in germany around 7,000 german graduates and researchers work in the us , gathering valuable skills in a competitive environment .
few see hope of advancing their careers back in germany .
a german group is trying to change that . intense international competition for the best brains in science and research represents a significant challenge for german society .
there is nothing out of the ordinary in young graduates wanting to test their mettle abroad . and because of the seemingly endless opportunities , a large number head to the united states where there are close links between industry and the universities . but now , a non-profit group called german scholars organization -lrb- gso -rrb- with offices in san francisco and berlin is in the middle of a large-scale campaign to turn “ brain drain ” into “ brain gain ” ultimately for the benefit of german society . " germany major recruiting base " professor eckhard schröter , a member of the board of gso , which was founded in san francisco in 2003 , told dw-radio why the initiative was so important . " it is extremely important for modern industrialized societies to enhance the knowledge base of their economy .
it flows from this that the mobility of researchers and top academics is decisive in this competition among major industrialized societies , " schröter said . " and germany actually is a major recruiting base for top-notch academics and researchers , " he pointed out .
" american universities and research institutes are among the major hosts of german scholars and academics of all disciplines but primarily in the most productive and innovative sciences such as biotech and nanotechnology . " " out of sight , out of mind " mentality the gso wants to try and counter the “ out-of-sight-out-of-mind ” mentality that german scholars abroad have to grapple with when they return home . contacts to institutions or companies in germany are , more often than not , lost very quickly when they leave the country .
this makes it very difficult to find a job on returning to germany . a pivotal part of the gso ’ s return project is a web-based career centre where german institutes and companies can place their vacancies and us-based job seekers can apply for these positions .
and according to schröter , many top-notch scholars do indeed want to return to germany . " if you look at survey data , there are at least 80 to 90 percent of respondents who tell us that they have an interest in returning to germany or to europe if there is a professional option in terms of their career advancement , " schröter said . promoting transatlantic relations the gso has also started organizing conferences in the us to bring together scholars and representatives from german firms and institutes . eckhard schröter admits that the project is still in its infancy , but insists first results are encouraging .
and he makes a point of emphasizing that the german scholars organization is not criticizing the scale of academic exchange between germany and the united states . " quite the contrary , that would give a totally different spin to our organization .
we are definitely in favor of international exchange , " schröter said . " what we want to do is very much promote transatlantic relations - that is at the very heart of our organization .
but we have to make sure is that this exchange does not turn into permanent immigration .

" i am happy with the result but we had some real problems at times , " declared magath . magath rolled out the big guns with brazilian world cup winner lucio and german international torsten frings - bought for a combined 21 million euros - in the starting line-up , but it was deisler who stole the show . " i look forward to every game at the moment , " enthused deisler .
" i really believe we can achieve something this season . " german international deisler , 24 , built on his sterling two-goal display in the 3-2 league cup win over werder bremen with another stellar performance scoring a trademark free-kick for the second goal . deisler missed six months of last season after being diagnosed with depression but now seems to be back on track after a good pre-season . michael ballack broke the deadlock on 22 minutes with brazilian ze roberto backheeling the ball into his path and the german international rifled a shot into the bottom corner . stuttgart vs mainz bildunterschrift : magath 's former club vfb stuttgart also collected maximum points as brazilian marksman cacau netted a hat-trick -lrb- 20,29,78 -rrb- in a 4-2 win over debutants mainz 05 on sunday . stuttgart , now under the guidance of matthias sammer , lie top of the table on goal difference with sv hamburg propping up the rest . reigning champions werder bremen needed a late goal from paraguayan substitute nelson haedo valdez to steal the home win over schalke 04 . ailton vs klose bildunterschrift : the encounter was billed as a duel between brazilian striker ailton - returning to the weserstadion in the colours of schalke - and his five million euro replacement miroslav klose - but it was valdez who snatched the headlines . valdez , 20 , replaced german international klose with 74 minutes gone and needed just nine minutes to have an impact prodding home a knockdown from valerien ismael in the 83rd minute to leave ailton and schalke deflated .

the presence of australian troops in iraq is expected to dominate the polls .
mr howard is seeking a fourth term , but faces stiff competition from labor party leader mark latham , with the two parties level in opinion polls .
" this election will be about trust , " said mr howard .
" who do you trust to lead the fight on australia 's behalf against international terrorism ? "
" who do you trust to keep the economy strong and protect family living standards ? " the prime minister said , speaking after he announced the election date .
despite close ratings in the opinion polls , labor has an advantage in second-preference votes , which would give it a crucial edge when parliamentary seats are allocated .
mr latham has announced he will withdraw the 800-strong australian contingent from its role supporting us forces in iraq , if he wins the vote .
mr howard 's liberal / national coalition last won in november 2001 , with a strong policy against illegal immigration .

mr ho won 296 out of 300 possible votes from the beijing-approved committee of politicians and businessmen .
he told correspondents he would continue to focus on the gambling haven 's booming economy .
mr ho - who has ruled macau since 1999 , when portugal handed the territory back to china - is credited with opening up the lucrative casino industry .
" my priority is to maintain the existing economic policy , " mr ho said .
" all the major effort will be spent consolidating and working on improving the quality of life in macau . "
' people love him ' mr ho 's victory was widely regarded as a foregone conclusion .
" it would be difficult for anyone to replace him anyway because the people here love him , " said au kam sam , one of only two macau legislators to have opposed mr ho 's policies .
macau 's pro-democracy movement , which holds two of the local legislature 's 27 seats , boycotted the poll , arguing that the process was " too conservative and oligarchic " .
the macau leader nonetheless visited community centres , factories and businesses ahead of the vote .
the result showed that one elector was absent , while three others returned blank ballots .
macau casino owner stanley ho -lrb- no relation -rrb- , said everyone " should be very happy " with mr ho 's reappointment .
" in fact , he has promised that he will ask everyone to unite and help each other and take the opportunity now to develop macau even better , " he told hong kong 's rthk radio .
election regulations do not permit mr ho , 49 , to stand for a third term .
semi-independent macau 's 450,000-strong population enjoy greater freedom than people elsewhere in china .
the enclave 's economy grew 25 % in the first quarter of this year .

macau 's pro-democracy movement , which holds two of the local legislature 's 27 seats , boycotted the poll , arguing that the process was " too conservative and oligarchic " .
the macau leader nonetheless visited community centres , factories and businesses ahead of the vote .
the result showed that one elector was absent , while three others returned blank ballots .
macau casino owner stanley ho -lrb- no relation -rrb- , said everyone " should be very happy " with mr ho 's reappointment .
" in fact , he has promised that he will ask everyone to unite and help each other and take the opportunity now to develop macau even better , " he told hong kong 's rthk radio .
election regulations do not permit mr ho , 49 , to stand for a third term .
semi-independent macau 's 450,000-strong population enjoy greater freedom than people elsewhere in china .
the enclave 's economy grew 25 % in the first quarter of this year .

last month , 22-year-old jemima phillips took over from catrin finch as prince charles ' official harpist .
the post was created to encourage talented young welsh harpists , and ms phillips was delighted to have been chosen for the two-year appointment .
she now hopes to use the role to raise her profile and plans to record a cd .
ms phillips , from ebbw vale , was first asked to perform for the prince at the end of last year .
" i played background music for prince charles at a private event in december , " she said .
" i do n't know if it was a test , but i wondered why catrin -lsb- finch -rsb- was n't doing it . "
i hope to be able to raise the profile of the harp with the general public " jemima phillips " then earlier this year , i was asked if i was offered the position , would i take it ?
" i said yes , but i was n't allowed to tell anyone about it . "
in 2000 , the prince of wales revived an ancient royal tradition by appointing catrin finch as his official harpist .
she was the first to receive the post since it was last granted in 1871 by queen victoria to john thomas .
ms finch , from llanon , near aberystwyth , had to relinquish the role after passing the job 's upper age limit of 25 .
then , during prince charles ' visit to wales in july , she was presented with a special brooch which is only given to the official harpist .
ms phillips has been playing the harp for 13 years , and is now doing an intensive masters course at the royal college of music in london .
" i knew by the time i was 11 it was what i wanted to do , " she said .
" now i am the first harp student to be accepted on the intensive masters course . "
high hopes as a young harpist in wales , she said she was well aware of the official harpist role , and had hoped to get it .
" i have known catrin for years - she talked to me about the things she had to do in the four years she has done it .
however , she is not expecting to be rushed off her feet . "
it is nice to think it will carry on for many years to come " catrin finch " catrin has told me it is about five or six engagements a year , and i am waiting to hear what the next one will be . "
but she knows what she wants to achieve .
" i want to be good at my job , and also use it to promote my own profile , and get a cd out . "
" i hope to be able to raise the profile of the harp with the general public and bring it into the 21st century . "
and ms finch is urging her successor to enjoy the job .
" she is very lucky , and she should use every opportunity she gets , " she said .
" for me , it was a major part of my career - i had my stint , and i feel pretty honoured .
" it is nice to think it will carry on for many years to come . "

the budget and final plans for cowley road were approved by the county council on 1 june , but now a major part of the scheme will not go ahead .
the green party 's local councillor has criticised the council for the late changes , saying he believed they were financially motivated .
the council says it is only responding to public complaints .
if the scheme is to be delivered on time and to budget - and retain its popular support - then such changes should be kept to the absolute minimum councillor craig simmons cowley road has the highest accident rate ratio of all shopping streets in oxfordshire , with 104 reported in the five years to 31 august 2003 .
forty-six of these involved cyclists .
the council has said it will not go ahead with the mini-roundabout proposed for the easternmost element of the scheme - the junction of magdalen road and cowley road - because of fears over cyclists ' safety and congestion .
but councillor craig simmons , said although minor changes to the plan was inevitable , he was concerned that such a major change had been announced after the proposals had been approved .
" these late changes by county officers to the cowley road design must not prove the thin end of the wedge , " the green party councillor said .
" if the scheme is to be delivered on time and to budget - and retain its popular support - then such changes should be kept to the absolute minimum . "
work on the scheme is expected to start in april next year , the council says .

monica lewinsky and rebecca loos took to the stage at the edinburgh tv festival on saturday to talk about chequebook journalism and its role in british broadcasting .
ms lewinsky said she took money because she had to pay the bills a packed auditorium gathered expectantly to hear about scandal , but left having heard two women defend their decisions to accept money for television interviews .
ms lewinsky , whose relationship with bill clinton led to impeachment proceedings , and ms loos , who had an alleged affair with david beckham , both said they accepted payment to set the record straight .
" it was about me being able to introduce myself as a real person to the world , " said ms lewinsky , who gave an interview to channel 4 for a reported £ 400,000 .
ms loos , who was paid a reported £ 150,000 by sky one , echoed the comments : " i was reading so much about myself in the papers that was not me . "
she added : " i wanted control over what was said and what was not said , rather than holding my head down in shame .
" i wanted to step forward and be on tv and for people to see who i really was . "
rebecca loos said she was fired from her job and " was on the streets " ms lewinsky was clearly confused about why such a debate was taking place at all .
" why not call it entertainment news ?
it 's not news , " she said in response to bbc journalist john sweeney 's comment from the audience that the public was being duped by chequebook journalism .
she added : " i do n't think that 's around any more .

both women said the money on offer had been important to them at the time .
" i had enormous legal bills .

" i would not spend that amount of money in the future .

the company is investigating claims that one of their machines was part of a batch of lasers which could potentially malfunction .
boots said it is looking into the claims " as a matter of urgency " but believes its equipment is safe .
the move follows reports of legal action in the us .
a lawsuit filed there claims some of the autonomous ladarvision systems , which are used in boots ' nine eye treatment clinics across britain , can develop faults leading to blurred vision .
the laser machine used in boots ' london eye surgery clinic in regent street was said to be from a batch identified in 2001 by swiss-owned health care company alcon as potentially having a problem .
the machine was modified by the laser manufacturer after concerns were raised , a boots spokeswoman said .
a statement from alcon claimed the allegations made in the us lawsuit were " completely unsupported by scientific or legitimate evidence " .
the statement added : " the ladarvision is safe and effective .
it has been extensively tested in clinical trials and was approved for its intended use by the us food and drug administration and other regulatory bodies around the world . "
no complaints around 49 patients who were treated with the london laser before it was modified are being contacted by the company to discover if they have suffered any adverse effects .
no complaints have been received so far .
a boots spokeswoman said : " there have been allegations that much older lasers may have been reported as having problems .
" we are looking for evidence of that from alcon .
" however , we have no reason to suspect any problems with our lasers in the uk .
" there is no reason to worry . "
the company is being sued in north carolina district court by ebw laser , which acquired 10 of its lasers to lease to us clinics , and alleges that two of the machines were " badly malfunctioning " , the times reported .

the un 's international open source network -lrb- iosn -rrb- helped promote the first annual software freedom day on 28 august , giving out cds and booklets about the technology .
events took place in countries like india , bangladesh , malaysia , philippines , sri lanka and vietnam .
open source is free and can offer big opportunities for developing countries .
the initiative was organised by free and open source software advocates under the umbrella of the software freedom day .
install-fest in december last year , the un held a major conference to find ways of bridging the digital divide - the difference in access to computer technologies in developed and developing nations .
in many developing countries , widespread access is difficult due to the high costs involved in setting up computer systems , buying licences and software support .
iosn tries to encourage countries to adopt affordable software so that the digital divide can be overcome .
the un body has backed the day 's events as part of its drive to encourage more people in asia to use free or open source software .
several open source applications were promoted during the day .
these include the operating system linux , openoffice , the mozilla web browser and e-mail project , mysql database and the apache web server .
computer users in south africa joined in too .
they were able to take their computers to one an " install-fest " station to have free software installed .
although such programs are free , many companies pay for linux-based software packages , like e-mail and word processing .
open-source systems let computer users and programmers change code and create new applications without paying a licence fee .
linux has made significant inroads into the software market in latin america and asia .
growing threat the asia-pacific region is a powerful market for dominant software companies like microsoft .
analysts say linux poses a growing threat to microsoft 's dominant windows operating system , which is used on more than 90 % of the world 's pcs .
last year , china , south korea and japan made a move to boost their joint research into a new open source computer operating system which would rival microsoft windows .
the japanese government has set aside one billion yen -lrb- us $ 85.5m -rrb- for the project .
and earlier this year , one of the world 's biggest computer manufacturer , hp , started to ship computers kitted out with linux to china and india .
microsoft has already tried to respond to the threat posed by open-source software by offering for sale a cheap version of its xp desktop operating system in malaysia , thailand and indonesia .
the software , called windows xp starter edition , will be available on low-cost hardware from october .

the un 's international open source network -lrb- iosn -rrb- helped promote the first annual software freedom day on 28 august , giving out cds and booklets about the technology .
events took place in countries like india , bangladesh , malaysia , philippines , sri lanka and vietnam .
open source is free and can offer big opportunities for developing countries .
the initiative was organised by free and open source software advocates under the umbrella of the software freedom day .
install-fest in december last year , the un held a major conference to find ways of bridging the digital divide - the difference in access to computer technologies in developed and developing nations .
in many developing countries , widespread access is difficult due to the high costs involved in setting up computer systems , buying licences and software support .
iosn tries to encourage countries to adopt affordable software so that the digital divide can be overcome .
the un body has backed the day 's events as part of its drive to encourage more people in asia to use free or open source software .
several open source applications were promoted during the day .
these include the operating system linux , openoffice , the mozilla web browser and e-mail project , mysql database and the apache web server .
computer users in south africa joined in too .
they were able to take their computers to one an " install-fest " station to have free software installed .
although such programs are free , many companies pay for linux-based software packages , like e-mail and word processing .
open-source systems let computer users and programmers change code and create new applications without paying a licence fee .
linux has made significant inroads into the software market in latin america and asia .
growing threat the asia-pacific region is a powerful market for dominant software companies like microsoft .
linux-based software is a threat to microsoft 's dominance analysts say linux poses a growing threat to microsoft 's dominant windows operating system , which is used on more than 90 % of the world 's pcs .
last year , china , south korea and japan made a move to boost their joint research into a new open source computer operating system which would rival microsoft windows .
the japanese government has set aside one billion yen -lrb- us $ 85.5m -rrb- for the project .
and earlier this year , one of the world 's biggest computer manufacturer , hp , started to ship computers kitted out with linux to china and india .
