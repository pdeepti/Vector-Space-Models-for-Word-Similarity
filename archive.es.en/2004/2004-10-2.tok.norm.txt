the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .
with the exception of bilingual editions of the two pre-eminent arabic poets , adonis from syria and mahmoud darwwih from palestine -lrb- both from the amman verlag -rrb- , german publishers have been hesitant to offer more poetry works .
fear no classics among the big-name german publishers , c.h. beck undoubtedly has the strongest oriental program .
its " new oriental library , " designed for bibliophiles but nonetheless affordable , is currently the only book series in the german language that offers a home to the great classics of islamic culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illuminated manuscript page from the koran , in the british library all of the other publishers focus their efforts almost exclusively on modern authors .
it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .
the choice of the arab world as guest region at this year 's frankfurt book fair calls for a certain amount of curiosity , openness and willingness to experiment on the part of all those involved : book dealers , critics , literary event organizers , publishers and , last but not least , readers .

and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .
with the exception of bilingual editions of the two pre-eminent arabic poets , adonis from syria and mahmoud darwwih from palestine -lrb- both from the amman verlag -rrb- , german publishers have been hesitant to offer more poetry works .
fear no classics among the big-name german publishers , c.h. beck undoubtedly has the strongest oriental program .
its " new oriental library , " designed for bibliophiles but nonetheless affordable , is currently the only book series in the german language that offers a home to the great classics of islamic culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illuminated manuscript page from the koran , in the british library all of the other publishers focus their efforts almost exclusively on modern authors .
it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .
the choice of the arab world as guest region at this year 's frankfurt book fair calls for a certain amount of curiosity , openness and willingness to experiment on the part of all those involved : book dealers , critics , literary event organizers , publishers and , last but not least , readers .
they will be richly rewarded with the discovery of a new literary continent , which promises to captivate for years to come and which might very well hold plenty of surprises in store for the future . stefan weidner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all .
-lrb- sept .
29 , 2004 -rrb- building bridges with books building a bridge between the middle east and the west is no small task , but its something the organizers of this year 's book fair in frankfurt hope to accomplish .
can literature and commerce do the job ?

meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .
while snow said he did n't fear a recession in the us as a result of the oil price , he did caution about a slowing of growth in the world economy .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet echoed those concerns , saying " all we are observing today is not encouraging . "
the euro zone 's chief banker said that if oil prices continued to climb it " could certainly hamper the global economy . "
more market information in an attempt to determine why oil costs have soared to levels that now threaten growth prospects , the world 's top economic leaders called for better market data .
the g7 pressed the international energy agency , founded during the 1974 oil crisis , to improve " oil data transparency , " and to help sort out whether scarce oil supplies , speculations or rocketing demand is behind the steady rise in prices .
germany and britain are reputedly involved in negotiations for a detailed oil transparency initiative .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .
this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .
" i think that in these cases , they 're moving in a direction that 's not very sensible in terms of future cultural developments . "

meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .
while snow said he did n't fear a recession in the us as a result of the oil price , he did caution about a slowing of growth in the world economy .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet echoed those concerns , saying " all we are observing today is not encouraging . "

germany and britain are reputedly involved in negotiations for a detailed oil transparency initiative .
ahead of the g7 meeting , chancellor gerhard schröder said he believed speculation was one of the main reasons for soaring prices and that a better overview of the market through increased information could improve the situation .

meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .
this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .

but german politicians should at least start showing that german can be used on the international stage just as readily as english or french , say the linguists .

at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey " a change in mentality is needed " waiting for eu capturing turkish culture 's changing face europe -pipe- 02.10.2004 turkey debate reduces eu 's enlargement appetite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate on turkey 's eu entry has often centered on religion as turkey awaits brussels ' decision to open concrete talks on its membership bid , experts fear that the divisive debate on ankara 's entry has already thrown a pall on the bloc 's enlargement euphoria . on october 6 , the european commission is expected to recommend that ankara get the green light to open eu membership negotiations .
the decision will be viewed as a victory in turkey , which has been on a reform drive in past years to fulfill eu accession criteria . but , brussels ' formal decision next week is not expected to silence the at times bitter and divisive debate within the eu on whether turkey should be invited to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish immigrants dressed in traditional costume during carnival in cologne , germany the eu is expected to cite 2015 as the first realistic date at which turkey could enter the 25-nation bloc .
both opponents and proponents of ankara 's membership bid are thus likely to dig in their heels for years to come and thrash out the pros and cons of the large muslim-dominated nation joining the bloc . harmful debate but some fear that the debate on eu membership for turkey is not just outdated , but also harmful . erhard busek , coordinator of the stability and growth pact for south-eastern europe said ever since the decision of the eu summit in 2002 , it 's been clear that turkey would get a full-fledged membership and not an alternative form of cooperation with the eu as skeptics are demanding . " one can debate about turkey .
but , in reality , the issue has already been decided , " busek told deutsche welle .
" the only problem is that the individual governments and leaders in the eu have n't explained the issue well in their home countries .
and that could cause a number of difficulties , " he said . eu at the end of its tether bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok however , german eu parliamentarian and member of the conservative evp , elmar brok , said he saw difficulties elsewhere . brok said the european union was at the end of its tether after the last large wave of expansion - where ten mainly former communist eastern european countries joined the bloc - and the tough negotiations over a constitution .
consolidation is now on the agenda ; the eu must focus on internal stabilization , brok said . " i do n't want the current 25-member union once again disintegrating into various categories , " brok said .
" but rather , the constitution which we agreed upon in summer , should also have some substance .
but it can only have that if the eu has internal negotiating capacity , " he added .
" it 's of no use to allow the eu to just become bigger and along with it , internally weaker . " eu full up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva , bulgarian minister for european affairs , right with european commission president romano prodi and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen but it 's already clear that eu expansion is n't going to stop at the entry of the ten eastern european nations .
bulgaria and romania have already been promised entries by 2007 . according to elmar brok , the two countries differ from turkey as far as membership goes .
" in the case of romania and bulgaria , entry negotiations have almost been concluded .
here , if they satisfy entry criteria by 2007 , the eu has to fulfill its promises of membership , " brok said .
" but it also shows that we 're full up .
and that 's why we need to apply the brakes here -lrb- in turkey 's case -rrb- . " at the latest , after croatia 's entry , the eu must ask itself whether it wants to expand further at all , brok said .

" in the case of romania and bulgaria , entry negotiations have almost been concluded .
here , if they satisfy entry criteria by 2007 , the eu has to fulfill its promises of membership , " brok said .
" but it also shows that we 're full up .
and that 's why we need to apply the brakes here -lrb- in turkey 's case -rrb- . " at the latest , after croatia 's entry , the eu must ask itself whether it wants to expand further at all , brok said .
he added that in turkey 's case , one should n't make overhasty mistakes but rather take time and see whether both sides had done their homework in two to three years . leaving the past behind but , even though romania and bulgaria 's entry into the eu look like a done deal , the perception there is that enlargement euphoria in the eu has largely evaporated . maria ligor of the romanian foreign ministry said she reckoned that brussels would pay more stringent attention to whether her country was fulfilling the enlargement criteria than has been the case with the current new members . ligor is clear , however , that bucharest would have no fundamental doubts against turkey 's eu entry as long as the country met the necessary criteria .
she said that negative emotions such as memories of the ottoman empire were a thing of the past . " the relationship to turkey has been strongly transformed .
we work closely together with turkey , especially in the south-eastern european region , in the black sea region , " ligor said .
" what 's important is to drive forward the democratization process in the caucasus .
the new relationship has pushed the past into the shadows . " klaus dahmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth after years of waiting , turkey says it 's ready to join the european union .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .
this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mit 5.000 neuen wörtern ist am freitag der neue duden in die buchläden gekommen .
die 22 .
auflage ist 1.152 seiten stark und enthält insgesamt 120.000 stichwörter as in the advertising industry , where surveys have shown that commercials using english words are lost to consumers , linguists have argued that politicians should speak in a clear and broadly understood language , avoiding jargon and foreign words .
convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .
" i think that in these cases , they 're moving in a direction that 's not very sensible in terms of future cultural developments . "
more deutsch at home not everyone need go as far as former us president john f. kennedy of the " ich bin ein berliner " fame or even more recently french president jacques chirac -lrb- " ich bin es wieder , " it 's me again -rrb- , who charmed the chancellor with his attempt at a colloquial greeting , and incorporate the local language into their speeches .
but german politicians should at least start showing that german can be used on the international stage just as readily as english or french , say the linguists .
for years , berlin has been lobbying to increase the use of german in all european institutions , with varied success .
a bit of self-confidence and more usage of the language by german politicians abroad could help those efforts . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german radio quota debate goes live one of the most debated topics at the popkomm music industry conference in berlin this week is that of a german radio quota as a means to promote german language music and artists .

munich came out 2-1 in the end , going in front through a michael ballack header in the 20th minute which looked suspiciously like a foul on the challenging bremen player miroslav klose .
the first half saw poor displays from both teams and plenty of brutal challenges beginning as early as the third minute when frank fahrenhorst clashed with ballack 's elbow and left the field with blood streaming from his nose .
the germany national player did not return , making straight for the hospital instead .
there was precious little ball play in the first 20 minutes , but fans of all-in wrestling will have thoroughly enjoyed what action did materialize with five yellow cards in total being waved in the tempestuous first half .
bayern 's felix magath chose to change the winning team which beat ajax amsterdam 4-0 in midweek , opting for sebastian deisler as a fifth midfielder at the expense of front man claudio pizarro .
otherwise , it was business as usual at the back with a defense including sammy kuffour and hasan salihamidzic who sought to deal with the threat posed by in-form miroslav klose and croatia hitman ivan klasnic , while owen hargreaves was charged with containing france playmaker johan micoud .
teams choose physicality over creativity bremen looked lackluster and could only count a borowski drive midway through the first half and a glaring klasnic miss on the half-hour as their best chances of the opening 45 minutes .
bayern were hardly any better but had more chances , mostly coming from ballack .

werder had scored thirteen of their fourteen league goals in the second 45 minutes , and kahn was swiftly forced into two brave stops within a minute from france defender valerien ismaël -lrb- photo -rrb- .
charisteas was proving a thorn in bayern 's side until felix magath brought his defensive tactics into operation in a bid to neutralize the tall greek striker and his fellow invigorated attackers .
magath sent on martin demichelis and bastian schweinsteiger for deisler and frings to stiffen the rearguard before the hour , prompting schaaf to throw on nelson valdez as a third striker .

munich came out 2-1 in the end , going in front through a michael ballack header in the 20th minute which looked suspiciously like a foul on the challenging bremen player miroslav klose .
the first half saw poor displays from both teams and plenty of brutal challenges beginning as early as the third minute when frank fahrenhorst clashed with ballack 's elbow and left the field with blood streaming from his nose .
the germany national player did not return , making straight for the hospital instead .
there was precious little ball play in the first 20 minutes , but fans of all-in wrestling will have thoroughly enjoyed what action did materialize with five yellow cards in total being waved in the tempestuous first half .
bayern 's felix magath chose to change the winning team which beat ajax amsterdam 4-0 in midweek , opting for sebastian deisler as a fifth midfielder at the expense of front man claudio pizarro .
otherwise , it was business as usual at the back with a defense including sammy kuffour and hasan salihamidzic who sought to deal with the threat posed by in-form miroslav klose and croatia hitman ivan klasnic , while owen hargreaves was charged with containing france playmaker johan micoud .
teams choose physicality over creativity bremen looked lackluster and could only count a borowski drive midway through the first half and a glaring klasnic miss on the half-hour as their best chances of the opening 45 minutes .
bayern were hardly any better but had more chances , mostly coming from ballack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack overcame the constant boos to open bayern 's account .
the germany captain saw an angled header saved by home keeper reinke after nine minutes and later side-footed wide with only reinke to beat .
greek hero inspires early bremen pressure werder came out fighting for the second period and the visitors were on the back foot for a good few minutes .
bremen coach thomas schaaf introduced greece euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas for klasnic after the break and the champions immediately piled on the pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valerien ismael was lively in the second half but could n't rally bremen .
werder had scored thirteen of their fourteen league goals in the second 45 minutes , and kahn was swiftly forced into two brave stops within a minute from france defender valerien ismaël -lrb- photo -rrb- .
charisteas was proving a thorn in bayern 's side until felix magath brought his defensive tactics into operation in a bid to neutralize the tall greek striker and his fellow invigorated attackers .
magath sent on martin demichelis and bastian schweinsteiger for deisler and frings to stiffen the rearguard before the hour , prompting schaaf to throw on nelson valdez as a third striker .
bad luck befalls bremen while schweinsteiger was supposed to prevent bremen from scoring , he was instrumental in bayern 's second goal .
a cross from roy makaay skewed into michael ballack 's path in front of goal but the midfielder 's shot was blocked .
the ball spun out to schweinsteiger whose own shot skimmed off christian schulz and arced around andreas reinke to give bayern a 2-0 lead .
but werder were not finished yet and klose guaranteed a dramatic last ten minutes with a trademark headed goal from magnin 's 81st minute free-kick .
the looping cross evaded a bayern defense which could be accused of ball watching for the bremen striker to steal in a nod the ball past oli kahn to set a dramatic finale .
in the end , bayern hung on to claim the three points and exacted revenge for a painful title-clinching home defeat to bremen last term , leapfrogging the champions in the standings in the process .
bayern now sit in third place and bremen move down to fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de victory is all as league threatens to splinter with one of the closest starts to a campaign in years , one slip could mean the difference between keeping pace with the leaders or calling it a day .

munich came out 2-1 in the end , going in front through a michael ballack header in the 20th minute which looked suspiciously like a foul on the challenging bremen player miroslav klose .
the first half saw poor displays from both teams and plenty of brutal challenges beginning as early as the third minute when frank fahrenhorst clashed with ballack 's elbow and left the field with blood streaming from his nose .
the germany national player did not return , making straight for the hospital instead .
there was precious little ball play in the first 20 minutes , but fans of all-in wrestling will have thoroughly enjoyed what action did materialize with five yellow cards in total being waved in the tempestuous first half .
bayern 's felix magath chose to change the winning team which beat ajax amsterdam 4-0 in midweek , opting for sebastian deisler as a fifth midfielder at the expense of front man claudio pizarro .
otherwise , it was business as usual at the back with a defense including sammy kuffour and hasan salihamidzic who sought to deal with the threat posed by in-form miroslav klose and croatia hitman ivan klasnic , while owen hargreaves was charged with containing france playmaker johan micoud .
teams choose physicality over creativity bremen looked lackluster and could only count a borowski drive midway through the first half and a glaring klasnic miss on the half-hour as their best chances of the opening 45 minutes .
bayern were hardly any better but had more chances , mostly coming from ballack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack overcame the constant boos to open bayern 's account .
the germany captain saw an angled header saved by home keeper reinke after nine minutes and later side-footed wide with only reinke to beat .
greek hero inspires early bremen pressure werder came out fighting for the second period and the visitors were on the back foot for a good few minutes .
bremen coach thomas schaaf introduced greece euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas for klasnic after the break and the champions immediately piled on the pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valerien ismael was lively in the second half but could n't rally bremen .
werder had scored thirteen of their fourteen league goals in the second 45 minutes , and kahn was swiftly forced into two brave stops within a minute from france defender valerien ismaël -lrb- photo -rrb- .
charisteas was proving a thorn in bayern 's side until felix magath brought his defensive tactics into operation in a bid to neutralize the tall greek striker and his fellow invigorated attackers .
magath sent on martin demichelis and bastian schweinsteiger for deisler and frings to stiffen the rearguard before the hour , prompting schaaf to throw on nelson valdez as a third striker .
bad luck befalls bremen while schweinsteiger was supposed to prevent bremen from scoring , he was instrumental in bayern 's second goal .
a cross from roy makaay skewed into michael ballack 's path in front of goal but the midfielder 's shot was blocked .
the ball spun out to schweinsteiger whose own shot skimmed off christian schulz and arced around andreas reinke to give bayern a 2-0 lead .
but werder were not finished yet and klose guaranteed a dramatic last ten minutes with a trademark headed goal from magnin 's 81st minute free-kick .
the looping cross evaded a bayern defense which could be accused of ball watching for the bremen striker to steal in a nod the ball past oli kahn to set a dramatic finale .
in the end , bayern hung on to claim the three points and exacted revenge for a painful title-clinching home defeat to bremen last term , leapfrogging the champions in the standings in the process .

the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .
with the exception of bilingual editions of the two pre-eminent arabic poets , adonis from syria and mahmoud darwwih from palestine -lrb- both from the amman verlag -rrb- , german publishers have been hesitant to offer more poetry works .
fear no classics among the big-name german publishers , c.h. beck undoubtedly has the strongest oriental program .
its " new oriental library , " designed for bibliophiles but nonetheless affordable , is currently the only book series in the german language that offers a home to the great classics of islamic culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illuminated manuscript page from the koran , in the british library all of the other publishers focus their efforts almost exclusively on modern authors .
it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .
the choice of the arab world as guest region at this year 's frankfurt book fair calls for a certain amount of curiosity , openness and willingness to experiment on the part of all those involved : book dealers , critics , literary event organizers , publishers and , last but not least , readers .
they will be richly rewarded with the discovery of a new literary continent , which promises to captivate for years to come and which might very well hold plenty of surprises in store for the future . stefan weidner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illuminated manuscript page from the koran , in the british library all of the other publishers focus their efforts almost exclusively on modern authors .
it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .
the choice of the arab world as guest region at this year 's frankfurt book fair calls for a certain amount of curiosity , openness and willingness to experiment on the part of all those involved : book dealers , critics , literary event organizers , publishers and , last but not least , readers .
they will be richly rewarded with the discovery of a new literary continent , which promises to captivate for years to come and which might very well hold plenty of surprises in store for the future . stefan weidner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all .

29 , 2004 -rrb- building bridges with books building a bridge between the middle east and the west is no small task , but its something the organizers of this year 's book fair in frankfurt hope to accomplish .

the decision will be viewed as a victory in turkey , which has been on a reform drive in past years to fulfill eu accession criteria . but , brussels ' formal decision next week is not expected to silence the at times bitter and divisive debate within the eu on whether turkey should be invited to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish immigrants dressed in traditional costume during carnival in cologne , germany the eu is expected to cite 2015 as the first realistic date at which turkey could enter the 25-nation bloc .
both opponents and proponents of ankara 's membership bid are thus likely to dig in their heels for years to come and thrash out the pros and cons of the large muslim-dominated nation joining the bloc . harmful debate but some fear that the debate on eu membership for turkey is not just outdated , but also harmful . erhard busek , coordinator of the stability and growth pact for south-eastern europe said ever since the decision of the eu summit in 2002 , it 's been clear that turkey would get a full-fledged membership and not an alternative form of cooperation with the eu as skeptics are demanding . " one can debate about turkey .
but , in reality , the issue has already been decided , " busek told deutsche welle .
" the only problem is that the individual governments and leaders in the eu have n't explained the issue well in their home countries .
and that could cause a number of difficulties , " he said . eu at the end of its tether bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok however , german eu parliamentarian and member of the conservative evp , elmar brok , said he saw difficulties elsewhere . brok said the european union was at the end of its tether after the last large wave of expansion - where ten mainly former communist eastern european countries joined the bloc - and the tough negotiations over a constitution .
consolidation is now on the agenda ; the eu must focus on internal stabilization , brok said . " i do n't want the current 25-member union once again disintegrating into various categories , " brok said .
" but rather , the constitution which we agreed upon in summer , should also have some substance .
but it can only have that if the eu has internal negotiating capacity , " he added .
" it 's of no use to allow the eu to just become bigger and along with it , internally weaker . " eu full up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva , bulgarian minister for european affairs , right with european commission president romano prodi and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen but it 's already clear that eu expansion is n't going to stop at the entry of the ten eastern european nations .

at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .

language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .
this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .

munich came out 2-1 in the end , going in front through a michael ballack header in the 20th minute which looked suspiciously like a foul on the challenging bremen player miroslav klose .
the first half saw poor displays from both teams and plenty of brutal challenges beginning as early as the third minute when frank fahrenhorst clashed with ballack 's elbow and left the field with blood streaming from his nose .
the germany national player did not return , making straight for the hospital instead .
there was precious little ball play in the first 20 minutes , but fans of all-in wrestling will have thoroughly enjoyed what action did materialize with five yellow cards in total being waved in the tempestuous first half .
bayern 's felix magath chose to change the winning team which beat ajax amsterdam 4-0 in midweek , opting for sebastian deisler as a fifth midfielder at the expense of front man claudio pizarro .
otherwise , it was business as usual at the back with a defense including sammy kuffour and hasan salihamidzic who sought to deal with the threat posed by in-form miroslav klose and croatia hitman ivan klasnic , while owen hargreaves was charged with containing france playmaker johan micoud .
teams choose physicality over creativity bremen looked lackluster and could only count a borowski drive midway through the first half and a glaring klasnic miss on the half-hour as their best chances of the opening 45 minutes .
bayern were hardly any better but had more chances , mostly coming from ballack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack overcame the constant boos to open bayern 's account .
the germany captain saw an angled header saved by home keeper reinke after nine minutes and later side-footed wide with only reinke to beat .
greek hero inspires early bremen pressure werder came out fighting for the second period and the visitors were on the back foot for a good few minutes .
bremen coach thomas schaaf introduced greece euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas for klasnic after the break and the champions immediately piled on the pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valerien ismael was lively in the second half but could n't rally bremen .
werder had scored thirteen of their fourteen league goals in the second 45 minutes , and kahn was swiftly forced into two brave stops within a minute from france defender valerien ismaël -lrb- photo -rrb- .
charisteas was proving a thorn in bayern 's side until felix magath brought his defensive tactics into operation in a bid to neutralize the tall greek striker and his fellow invigorated attackers .
magath sent on martin demichelis and bastian schweinsteiger for deisler and frings to stiffen the rearguard before the hour , prompting schaaf to throw on nelson valdez as a third striker .
bad luck befalls bremen while schweinsteiger was supposed to prevent bremen from scoring , he was instrumental in bayern 's second goal .
a cross from roy makaay skewed into michael ballack 's path in front of goal but the midfielder 's shot was blocked .
the ball spun out to schweinsteiger whose own shot skimmed off christian schulz and arced around andreas reinke to give bayern a 2-0 lead .
but werder were not finished yet and klose guaranteed a dramatic last ten minutes with a trademark headed goal from magnin 's 81st minute free-kick .
the looping cross evaded a bayern defense which could be accused of ball watching for the bremen striker to steal in a nod the ball past oli kahn to set a dramatic finale .
in the end , bayern hung on to claim the three points and exacted revenge for a painful title-clinching home defeat to bremen last term , leapfrogging the champions in the standings in the process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 2004 frankfurt book fair book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2004 opinion : open , sesame ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a world of books waits to be discovered when the frankfurt book fair opens next week , the guest of honor will be the arab world .
the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .
with the exception of bilingual editions of the two pre-eminent arabic poets , adonis from syria and mahmoud darwwih from palestine -lrb- both from the amman verlag -rrb- , german publishers have been hesitant to offer more poetry works .
fear no classics among the big-name german publishers , c.h. beck undoubtedly has the strongest oriental program .
its " new oriental library , " designed for bibliophiles but nonetheless affordable , is currently the only book series in the german language that offers a home to the great classics of islamic culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illuminated manuscript page from the koran , in the british library all of the other publishers focus their efforts almost exclusively on modern authors .
it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .
the choice of the arab world as guest region at this year 's frankfurt book fair calls for a certain amount of curiosity , openness and willingness to experiment on the part of all those involved : book dealers , critics , literary event organizers , publishers and , last but not least , readers .
they will be richly rewarded with the discovery of a new literary continent , which promises to captivate for years to come and which might very well hold plenty of surprises in store for the future . stefan weidner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all .
-lrb- sept .
29 , 2004 -rrb- building bridges with books building a bridge between the middle east and the west is no small task , but its something the organizers of this year 's book fair in frankfurt hope to accomplish .
can literature and commerce do the job ?

the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .
with the exception of bilingual editions of the two pre-eminent arabic poets , adonis from syria and mahmoud darwwih from palestine -lrb- both from the amman verlag -rrb- , german publishers have been hesitant to offer more poetry works .
fear no classics among the big-name german publishers , c.h. beck undoubtedly has the strongest oriental program .
its " new oriental library , " designed for bibliophiles but nonetheless affordable , is currently the only book series in the german language that offers a home to the great classics of islamic culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illuminated manuscript page from the koran , in the british library all of the other publishers focus their efforts almost exclusively on modern authors .
it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .
the choice of the arab world as guest region at this year 's frankfurt book fair calls for a certain amount of curiosity , openness and willingness to experiment on the part of all those involved : book dealers , critics , literary event organizers , publishers and , last but not least , readers .
they will be richly rewarded with the discovery of a new literary continent , which promises to captivate for years to come and which might very well hold plenty of surprises in store for the future . stefan weidner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .

meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .

the decision will be viewed as a victory in turkey , which has been on a reform drive in past years to fulfill eu accession criteria . but , brussels ' formal decision next week is not expected to silence the at times bitter and divisive debate within the eu on whether turkey should be invited to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish immigrants dressed in traditional costume during carnival in cologne , germany the eu is expected to cite 2015 as the first realistic date at which turkey could enter the 25-nation bloc .
both opponents and proponents of ankara 's membership bid are thus likely to dig in their heels for years to come and thrash out the pros and cons of the large muslim-dominated nation joining the bloc . harmful debate but some fear that the debate on eu membership for turkey is not just outdated , but also harmful . erhard busek , coordinator of the stability and growth pact for south-eastern europe said ever since the decision of the eu summit in 2002 , it 's been clear that turkey would get a full-fledged membership and not an alternative form of cooperation with the eu as skeptics are demanding . " one can debate about turkey .
but , in reality , the issue has already been decided , " busek told deutsche welle .
" the only problem is that the individual governments and leaders in the eu have n't explained the issue well in their home countries .
and that could cause a number of difficulties , " he said . eu at the end of its tether bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok however , german eu parliamentarian and member of the conservative evp , elmar brok , said he saw difficulties elsewhere . brok said the european union was at the end of its tether after the last large wave of expansion - where ten mainly former communist eastern european countries joined the bloc - and the tough negotiations over a constitution .
consolidation is now on the agenda ; the eu must focus on internal stabilization , brok said . " i do n't want the current 25-member union once again disintegrating into various categories , " brok said .
" but rather , the constitution which we agreed upon in summer , should also have some substance .
but it can only have that if the eu has internal negotiating capacity , " he added .
" it 's of no use to allow the eu to just become bigger and along with it , internally weaker . " eu full up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva , bulgarian minister for european affairs , right with european commission president romano prodi and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen but it 's already clear that eu expansion is n't going to stop at the entry of the ten eastern european nations .
bulgaria and romania have already been promised entries by 2007 . according to elmar brok , the two countries differ from turkey as far as membership goes .
" in the case of romania and bulgaria , entry negotiations have almost been concluded .
here , if they satisfy entry criteria by 2007 , the eu has to fulfill its promises of membership , " brok said .
" but it also shows that we 're full up .
and that 's why we need to apply the brakes here -lrb- in turkey 's case -rrb- . " at the latest , after croatia 's entry , the eu must ask itself whether it wants to expand further at all , brok said .
he added that in turkey 's case , one should n't make overhasty mistakes but rather take time and see whether both sides had done their homework in two to three years . leaving the past behind but , even though romania and bulgaria 's entry into the eu look like a done deal , the perception there is that enlargement euphoria in the eu has largely evaporated . maria ligor of the romanian foreign ministry said she reckoned that brussels would pay more stringent attention to whether her country was fulfilling the enlargement criteria than has been the case with the current new members . ligor is clear , however , that bucharest would have no fundamental doubts against turkey 's eu entry as long as the country met the necessary criteria .
she said that negative emotions such as memories of the ottoman empire were a thing of the past . " the relationship to turkey has been strongly transformed .
we work closely together with turkey , especially in the south-eastern european region , in the black sea region , " ligor said .
" what 's important is to drive forward the democratization process in the caucasus .

meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .
while snow said he did n't fear a recession in the us as a result of the oil price , he did caution about a slowing of growth in the world economy .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet echoed those concerns , saying " all we are observing today is not encouraging . "
the euro zone 's chief banker said that if oil prices continued to climb it " could certainly hamper the global economy . "
more market information in an attempt to determine why oil costs have soared to levels that now threaten growth prospects , the world 's top economic leaders called for better market data .
the g7 pressed the international energy agency , founded during the 1974 oil crisis , to improve " oil data transparency , " and to help sort out whether scarce oil supplies , speculations or rocketing demand is behind the steady rise in prices .
germany and britain are reputedly involved in negotiations for a detailed oil transparency initiative .
ahead of the g7 meeting , chancellor gerhard schröder said he believed speculation was one of the main reasons for soaring prices and that a better overview of the market through increased information could improve the situation .
bildunterschrift : supplies can not meet up with the growing demand for oil little power to change price better information and calls for increased production will most likely do very little in bringing down the oil price .
analysts say the g7 has little influence over the oil market .
the problem is one of simple economics , they point out : demand is outpacing supply , said nariman behravesh , chief economist at the economic research firm global insight .
" it 's not as if opec is manipulating the market .

the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .

but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .

the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .
with the exception of bilingual editions of the two pre-eminent arabic poets , adonis from syria and mahmoud darwwih from palestine -lrb- both from the amman verlag -rrb- , german publishers have been hesitant to offer more poetry works .
fear no classics among the big-name german publishers , c.h. beck undoubtedly has the strongest oriental program .
its " new oriental library , " designed for bibliophiles but nonetheless affordable , is currently the only book series in the german language that offers a home to the great classics of islamic culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illuminated manuscript page from the koran , in the british library all of the other publishers focus their efforts almost exclusively on modern authors .
it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .
the choice of the arab world as guest region at this year 's frankfurt book fair calls for a certain amount of curiosity , openness and willingness to experiment on the part of all those involved : book dealers , critics , literary event organizers , publishers and , last but not least , readers .

munich came out 2-1 in the end , going in front through a michael ballack header in the 20th minute which looked suspiciously like a foul on the challenging bremen player miroslav klose .
the first half saw poor displays from both teams and plenty of brutal challenges beginning as early as the third minute when frank fahrenhorst clashed with ballack 's elbow and left the field with blood streaming from his nose .
the germany national player did not return , making straight for the hospital instead .
there was precious little ball play in the first 20 minutes , but fans of all-in wrestling will have thoroughly enjoyed what action did materialize with five yellow cards in total being waved in the tempestuous first half .
bayern 's felix magath chose to change the winning team which beat ajax amsterdam 4-0 in midweek , opting for sebastian deisler as a fifth midfielder at the expense of front man claudio pizarro .
otherwise , it was business as usual at the back with a defense including sammy kuffour and hasan salihamidzic who sought to deal with the threat posed by in-form miroslav klose and croatia hitman ivan klasnic , while owen hargreaves was charged with containing france playmaker johan micoud .
teams choose physicality over creativity bremen looked lackluster and could only count a borowski drive midway through the first half and a glaring klasnic miss on the half-hour as their best chances of the opening 45 minutes .
bayern were hardly any better but had more chances , mostly coming from ballack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack overcame the constant boos to open bayern 's account .
the germany captain saw an angled header saved by home keeper reinke after nine minutes and later side-footed wide with only reinke to beat .
greek hero inspires early bremen pressure werder came out fighting for the second period and the visitors were on the back foot for a good few minutes .
bremen coach thomas schaaf introduced greece euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas for klasnic after the break and the champions immediately piled on the pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valerien ismael was lively in the second half but could n't rally bremen .
werder had scored thirteen of their fourteen league goals in the second 45 minutes , and kahn was swiftly forced into two brave stops within a minute from france defender valerien ismaël -lrb- photo -rrb- .
charisteas was proving a thorn in bayern 's side until felix magath brought his defensive tactics into operation in a bid to neutralize the tall greek striker and his fellow invigorated attackers .
magath sent on martin demichelis and bastian schweinsteiger for deisler and frings to stiffen the rearguard before the hour , prompting schaaf to throw on nelson valdez as a third striker .
bad luck befalls bremen while schweinsteiger was supposed to prevent bremen from scoring , he was instrumental in bayern 's second goal .
a cross from roy makaay skewed into michael ballack 's path in front of goal but the midfielder 's shot was blocked .
the ball spun out to schweinsteiger whose own shot skimmed off christian schulz and arced around andreas reinke to give bayern a 2-0 lead .
but werder were not finished yet and klose guaranteed a dramatic last ten minutes with a trademark headed goal from magnin 's 81st minute free-kick .
the looping cross evaded a bayern defense which could be accused of ball watching for the bremen striker to steal in a nod the ball past oli kahn to set a dramatic finale .
in the end , bayern hung on to claim the three points and exacted revenge for a painful title-clinching home defeat to bremen last term , leapfrogging the champions in the standings in the process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey " a change in mentality is needed " waiting for eu capturing turkish culture 's changing face europe -pipe- 02.10.2004 turkey debate reduces eu 's enlargement appetite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate on turkey 's eu entry has often centered on religion as turkey awaits brussels ' decision to open concrete talks on its membership bid , experts fear that the divisive debate on ankara 's entry has already thrown a pall on the bloc 's enlargement euphoria . on october 6 , the european commission is expected to recommend that ankara get the green light to open eu membership negotiations .
the decision will be viewed as a victory in turkey , which has been on a reform drive in past years to fulfill eu accession criteria . but , brussels ' formal decision next week is not expected to silence the at times bitter and divisive debate within the eu on whether turkey should be invited to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish immigrants dressed in traditional costume during carnival in cologne , germany the eu is expected to cite 2015 as the first realistic date at which turkey could enter the 25-nation bloc .
both opponents and proponents of ankara 's membership bid are thus likely to dig in their heels for years to come and thrash out the pros and cons of the large muslim-dominated nation joining the bloc . harmful debate but some fear that the debate on eu membership for turkey is not just outdated , but also harmful . erhard busek , coordinator of the stability and growth pact for south-eastern europe said ever since the decision of the eu summit in 2002 , it 's been clear that turkey would get a full-fledged membership and not an alternative form of cooperation with the eu as skeptics are demanding . " one can debate about turkey .
but , in reality , the issue has already been decided , " busek told deutsche welle .
" the only problem is that the individual governments and leaders in the eu have n't explained the issue well in their home countries .
and that could cause a number of difficulties , " he said . eu at the end of its tether bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok however , german eu parliamentarian and member of the conservative evp , elmar brok , said he saw difficulties elsewhere . brok said the european union was at the end of its tether after the last large wave of expansion - where ten mainly former communist eastern european countries joined the bloc - and the tough negotiations over a constitution .
consolidation is now on the agenda ; the eu must focus on internal stabilization , brok said . " i do n't want the current 25-member union once again disintegrating into various categories , " brok said .
" but rather , the constitution which we agreed upon in summer , should also have some substance .
but it can only have that if the eu has internal negotiating capacity , " he added .
" it 's of no use to allow the eu to just become bigger and along with it , internally weaker . " eu full up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva , bulgarian minister for european affairs , right with european commission president romano prodi and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen but it 's already clear that eu expansion is n't going to stop at the entry of the ten eastern european nations .
bulgaria and romania have already been promised entries by 2007 . according to elmar brok , the two countries differ from turkey as far as membership goes .
" in the case of romania and bulgaria , entry negotiations have almost been concluded .
here , if they satisfy entry criteria by 2007 , the eu has to fulfill its promises of membership , " brok said .
" but it also shows that we 're full up .
and that 's why we need to apply the brakes here -lrb- in turkey 's case -rrb- . " at the latest , after croatia 's entry , the eu must ask itself whether it wants to expand further at all , brok said .
he added that in turkey 's case , one should n't make overhasty mistakes but rather take time and see whether both sides had done their homework in two to three years . leaving the past behind but , even though romania and bulgaria 's entry into the eu look like a done deal , the perception there is that enlargement euphoria in the eu has largely evaporated . maria ligor of the romanian foreign ministry said she reckoned that brussels would pay more stringent attention to whether her country was fulfilling the enlargement criteria than has been the case with the current new members . ligor is clear , however , that bucharest would have no fundamental doubts against turkey 's eu entry as long as the country met the necessary criteria .
she said that negative emotions such as memories of the ottoman empire were a thing of the past . " the relationship to turkey has been strongly transformed .

the decision will be viewed as a victory in turkey , which has been on a reform drive in past years to fulfill eu accession criteria . but , brussels ' formal decision next week is not expected to silence the at times bitter and divisive debate within the eu on whether turkey should be invited to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish immigrants dressed in traditional costume during carnival in cologne , germany the eu is expected to cite 2015 as the first realistic date at which turkey could enter the 25-nation bloc .
both opponents and proponents of ankara 's membership bid are thus likely to dig in their heels for years to come and thrash out the pros and cons of the large muslim-dominated nation joining the bloc . harmful debate but some fear that the debate on eu membership for turkey is not just outdated , but also harmful . erhard busek , coordinator of the stability and growth pact for south-eastern europe said ever since the decision of the eu summit in 2002 , it 's been clear that turkey would get a full-fledged membership and not an alternative form of cooperation with the eu as skeptics are demanding . " one can debate about turkey .
but , in reality , the issue has already been decided , " busek told deutsche welle .
" the only problem is that the individual governments and leaders in the eu have n't explained the issue well in their home countries .
and that could cause a number of difficulties , " he said . eu at the end of its tether bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok however , german eu parliamentarian and member of the conservative evp , elmar brok , said he saw difficulties elsewhere . brok said the european union was at the end of its tether after the last large wave of expansion - where ten mainly former communist eastern european countries joined the bloc - and the tough negotiations over a constitution .
consolidation is now on the agenda ; the eu must focus on internal stabilization , brok said . " i do n't want the current 25-member union once again disintegrating into various categories , " brok said .
" but rather , the constitution which we agreed upon in summer , should also have some substance .
but it can only have that if the eu has internal negotiating capacity , " he added .
" it 's of no use to allow the eu to just become bigger and along with it , internally weaker . " eu full up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva , bulgarian minister for european affairs , right with european commission president romano prodi and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen but it 's already clear that eu expansion is n't going to stop at the entry of the ten eastern european nations .
bulgaria and romania have already been promised entries by 2007 . according to elmar brok , the two countries differ from turkey as far as membership goes .
" in the case of romania and bulgaria , entry negotiations have almost been concluded .
here , if they satisfy entry criteria by 2007 , the eu has to fulfill its promises of membership , " brok said .
" but it also shows that we 're full up .
and that 's why we need to apply the brakes here -lrb- in turkey 's case -rrb- . " at the latest , after croatia 's entry , the eu must ask itself whether it wants to expand further at all , brok said .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .

23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .
this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mit 5.000 neuen wörtern ist am freitag der neue duden in die buchläden gekommen .
die 22 .
auflage ist 1.152 seiten stark und enthält insgesamt 120.000 stichwörter as in the advertising industry , where surveys have shown that commercials using english words are lost to consumers , linguists have argued that politicians should speak in a clear and broadly understood language , avoiding jargon and foreign words .
convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .
" i think that in these cases , they 're moving in a direction that 's not very sensible in terms of future cultural developments . "
more deutsch at home not everyone need go as far as former us president john f. kennedy of the " ich bin ein berliner " fame or even more recently french president jacques chirac -lrb- " ich bin es wieder , " it 's me again -rrb- , who charmed the chancellor with his attempt at a colloquial greeting , and incorporate the local language into their speeches .
but german politicians should at least start showing that german can be used on the international stage just as readily as english or french , say the linguists .
for years , berlin has been lobbying to increase the use of german in all european institutions , with varied success .
a bit of self-confidence and more usage of the language by german politicians abroad could help those efforts . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german radio quota debate goes live one of the most debated topics at the popkomm music industry conference in berlin this week is that of a german radio quota as a means to promote german language music and artists .

" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .
while snow said he did n't fear a recession in the us as a result of the oil price , he did caution about a slowing of growth in the world economy .

germany and britain are reputedly involved in negotiations for a detailed oil transparency initiative .

meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .
while snow said he did n't fear a recession in the us as a result of the oil price , he did caution about a slowing of growth in the world economy .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet echoed those concerns , saying " all we are observing today is not encouraging . "
the euro zone 's chief banker said that if oil prices continued to climb it " could certainly hamper the global economy . "
more market information in an attempt to determine why oil costs have soared to levels that now threaten growth prospects , the world 's top economic leaders called for better market data .
the g7 pressed the international energy agency , founded during the 1974 oil crisis , to improve " oil data transparency , " and to help sort out whether scarce oil supplies , speculations or rocketing demand is behind the steady rise in prices .
germany and britain are reputedly involved in negotiations for a detailed oil transparency initiative .
ahead of the g7 meeting , chancellor gerhard schröder said he believed speculation was one of the main reasons for soaring prices and that a better overview of the market through increased information could improve the situation .
bildunterschrift : supplies can not meet up with the growing demand for oil little power to change price better information and calls for increased production will most likely do very little in bringing down the oil price .
analysts say the g7 has little influence over the oil market .
the problem is one of simple economics , they point out : demand is outpacing supply , said nariman behravesh , chief economist at the economic research firm global insight .
" it 's not as if opec is manipulating the market .
there 's really not much anybody can do until the investments now being made bring some fruit , " he added .
the g7 may be effective in currency markets , but they have no real history in the oil markets .
in all reality , the price of oil will only come down when the supply improves and global growth begins to slow . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for oil market transparency in the face of record high oil prices , germany and britain are expected at the g7 meeting on friday in washington to propose measures to make world oil markets more transparent .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .
this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .
" i think that in these cases , they 're moving in a direction that 's not very sensible in terms of future cultural developments . "

but german politicians should at least start showing that german can be used on the international stage just as readily as english or french , say the linguists .
for years , berlin has been lobbying to increase the use of german in all european institutions , with varied success .
a bit of self-confidence and more usage of the language by german politicians abroad could help those efforts . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german radio quota debate goes live one of the most debated topics at the popkomm music industry conference in berlin this week is that of a german radio quota as a means to promote german language music and artists .

munich came out 2-1 in the end , going in front through a michael ballack header in the 20th minute which looked suspiciously like a foul on the challenging bremen player miroslav klose .
the first half saw poor displays from both teams and plenty of brutal challenges beginning as early as the third minute when frank fahrenhorst clashed with ballack 's elbow and left the field with blood streaming from his nose .
the germany national player did not return , making straight for the hospital instead .
there was precious little ball play in the first 20 minutes , but fans of all-in wrestling will have thoroughly enjoyed what action did materialize with five yellow cards in total being waved in the tempestuous first half .
bayern 's felix magath chose to change the winning team which beat ajax amsterdam 4-0 in midweek , opting for sebastian deisler as a fifth midfielder at the expense of front man claudio pizarro .
otherwise , it was business as usual at the back with a defense including sammy kuffour and hasan salihamidzic who sought to deal with the threat posed by in-form miroslav klose and croatia hitman ivan klasnic , while owen hargreaves was charged with containing france playmaker johan micoud .
teams choose physicality over creativity bremen looked lackluster and could only count a borowski drive midway through the first half and a glaring klasnic miss on the half-hour as their best chances of the opening 45 minutes .

werder had scored thirteen of their fourteen league goals in the second 45 minutes , and kahn was swiftly forced into two brave stops within a minute from france defender valerien ismaël -lrb- photo -rrb- .
charisteas was proving a thorn in bayern 's side until felix magath brought his defensive tactics into operation in a bid to neutralize the tall greek striker and his fellow invigorated attackers .
magath sent on martin demichelis and bastian schweinsteiger for deisler and frings to stiffen the rearguard before the hour , prompting schaaf to throw on nelson valdez as a third striker .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .

this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .

23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .

meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .
while snow said he did n't fear a recession in the us as a result of the oil price , he did caution about a slowing of growth in the world economy .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet echoed those concerns , saying " all we are observing today is not encouraging . "
the euro zone 's chief banker said that if oil prices continued to climb it " could certainly hamper the global economy . "
more market information in an attempt to determine why oil costs have soared to levels that now threaten growth prospects , the world 's top economic leaders called for better market data .
the g7 pressed the international energy agency , founded during the 1974 oil crisis , to improve " oil data transparency , " and to help sort out whether scarce oil supplies , speculations or rocketing demand is behind the steady rise in prices .
germany and britain are reputedly involved in negotiations for a detailed oil transparency initiative .
ahead of the g7 meeting , chancellor gerhard schröder said he believed speculation was one of the main reasons for soaring prices and that a better overview of the market through increased information could improve the situation .
bildunterschrift : supplies can not meet up with the growing demand for oil little power to change price better information and calls for increased production will most likely do very little in bringing down the oil price .
analysts say the g7 has little influence over the oil market .
the problem is one of simple economics , they point out : demand is outpacing supply , said nariman behravesh , chief economist at the economic research firm global insight .
" it 's not as if opec is manipulating the market .
there 's really not much anybody can do until the investments now being made bring some fruit , " he added .
the g7 may be effective in currency markets , but they have no real history in the oil markets .
in all reality , the price of oil will only come down when the supply improves and global growth begins to slow . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for oil market transparency in the face of record high oil prices , germany and britain are expected at the g7 meeting on friday in washington to propose measures to make world oil markets more transparent .

the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .
with the exception of bilingual editions of the two pre-eminent arabic poets , adonis from syria and mahmoud darwwih from palestine -lrb- both from the amman verlag -rrb- , german publishers have been hesitant to offer more poetry works .
fear no classics among the big-name german publishers , c.h. beck undoubtedly has the strongest oriental program .
its " new oriental library , " designed for bibliophiles but nonetheless affordable , is currently the only book series in the german language that offers a home to the great classics of islamic culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illuminated manuscript page from the koran , in the british library all of the other publishers focus their efforts almost exclusively on modern authors .
it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .
the choice of the arab world as guest region at this year 's frankfurt book fair calls for a certain amount of curiosity , openness and willingness to experiment on the part of all those involved : book dealers , critics , literary event organizers , publishers and , last but not least , readers .
they will be richly rewarded with the discovery of a new literary continent , which promises to captivate for years to come and which might very well hold plenty of surprises in store for the future . stefan weidner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .

the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .
with the exception of bilingual editions of the two pre-eminent arabic poets , adonis from syria and mahmoud darwwih from palestine -lrb- both from the amman verlag -rrb- , german publishers have been hesitant to offer more poetry works .
fear no classics among the big-name german publishers , c.h. beck undoubtedly has the strongest oriental program .
its " new oriental library , " designed for bibliophiles but nonetheless affordable , is currently the only book series in the german language that offers a home to the great classics of islamic culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illuminated manuscript page from the koran , in the british library all of the other publishers focus their efforts almost exclusively on modern authors .
it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .

the decision will be viewed as a victory in turkey , which has been on a reform drive in past years to fulfill eu accession criteria . but , brussels ' formal decision next week is not expected to silence the at times bitter and divisive debate within the eu on whether turkey should be invited to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish immigrants dressed in traditional costume during carnival in cologne , germany the eu is expected to cite 2015 as the first realistic date at which turkey could enter the 25-nation bloc .
both opponents and proponents of ankara 's membership bid are thus likely to dig in their heels for years to come and thrash out the pros and cons of the large muslim-dominated nation joining the bloc . harmful debate but some fear that the debate on eu membership for turkey is not just outdated , but also harmful . erhard busek , coordinator of the stability and growth pact for south-eastern europe said ever since the decision of the eu summit in 2002 , it 's been clear that turkey would get a full-fledged membership and not an alternative form of cooperation with the eu as skeptics are demanding . " one can debate about turkey .
but , in reality , the issue has already been decided , " busek told deutsche welle .
" the only problem is that the individual governments and leaders in the eu have n't explained the issue well in their home countries .
and that could cause a number of difficulties , " he said . eu at the end of its tether bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok however , german eu parliamentarian and member of the conservative evp , elmar brok , said he saw difficulties elsewhere . brok said the european union was at the end of its tether after the last large wave of expansion - where ten mainly former communist eastern european countries joined the bloc - and the tough negotiations over a constitution .
consolidation is now on the agenda ; the eu must focus on internal stabilization , brok said . " i do n't want the current 25-member union once again disintegrating into various categories , " brok said .
" but rather , the constitution which we agreed upon in summer , should also have some substance .
but it can only have that if the eu has internal negotiating capacity , " he added .
" it 's of no use to allow the eu to just become bigger and along with it , internally weaker . " eu full up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva , bulgarian minister for european affairs , right with european commission president romano prodi and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen but it 's already clear that eu expansion is n't going to stop at the entry of the ten eastern european nations .
bulgaria and romania have already been promised entries by 2007 . according to elmar brok , the two countries differ from turkey as far as membership goes .
" in the case of romania and bulgaria , entry negotiations have almost been concluded .
here , if they satisfy entry criteria by 2007 , the eu has to fulfill its promises of membership , " brok said .
" but it also shows that we 're full up .
and that 's why we need to apply the brakes here -lrb- in turkey 's case -rrb- . " at the latest , after croatia 's entry , the eu must ask itself whether it wants to expand further at all , brok said .
he added that in turkey 's case , one should n't make overhasty mistakes but rather take time and see whether both sides had done their homework in two to three years . leaving the past behind but , even though romania and bulgaria 's entry into the eu look like a done deal , the perception there is that enlargement euphoria in the eu has largely evaporated . maria ligor of the romanian foreign ministry said she reckoned that brussels would pay more stringent attention to whether her country was fulfilling the enlargement criteria than has been the case with the current new members . ligor is clear , however , that bucharest would have no fundamental doubts against turkey 's eu entry as long as the country met the necessary criteria .
she said that negative emotions such as memories of the ottoman empire were a thing of the past . " the relationship to turkey has been strongly transformed .
we work closely together with turkey , especially in the south-eastern european region , in the black sea region , " ligor said .
" what 's important is to drive forward the democratization process in the caucasus .
the new relationship has pushed the past into the shadows . " klaus dahmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth after years of waiting , turkey says it 's ready to join the european union .

" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .
while snow said he did n't fear a recession in the us as a result of the oil price , he did caution about a slowing of growth in the world economy .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet echoed those concerns , saying " all we are observing today is not encouraging . "
the euro zone 's chief banker said that if oil prices continued to climb it " could certainly hamper the global economy . "
more market information in an attempt to determine why oil costs have soared to levels that now threaten growth prospects , the world 's top economic leaders called for better market data .
the g7 pressed the international energy agency , founded during the 1974 oil crisis , to improve " oil data transparency , " and to help sort out whether scarce oil supplies , speculations or rocketing demand is behind the steady rise in prices .
germany and britain are reputedly involved in negotiations for a detailed oil transparency initiative .
ahead of the g7 meeting , chancellor gerhard schröder said he believed speculation was one of the main reasons for soaring prices and that a better overview of the market through increased information could improve the situation .
bildunterschrift : supplies can not meet up with the growing demand for oil little power to change price better information and calls for increased production will most likely do very little in bringing down the oil price .
analysts say the g7 has little influence over the oil market .
the problem is one of simple economics , they point out : demand is outpacing supply , said nariman behravesh , chief economist at the economic research firm global insight .
" it 's not as if opec is manipulating the market .
there 's really not much anybody can do until the investments now being made bring some fruit , " he added .

meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "

the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .
with the exception of bilingual editions of the two pre-eminent arabic poets , adonis from syria and mahmoud darwwih from palestine -lrb- both from the amman verlag -rrb- , german publishers have been hesitant to offer more poetry works .
fear no classics among the big-name german publishers , c.h. beck undoubtedly has the strongest oriental program .

it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .
the choice of the arab world as guest region at this year 's frankfurt book fair calls for a certain amount of curiosity , openness and willingness to experiment on the part of all those involved : book dealers , critics , literary event organizers , publishers and , last but not least , readers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 2004 frankfurt book fair book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2004 opinion : open , sesame ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a world of books waits to be discovered when the frankfurt book fair opens next week , the guest of honor will be the arab world .
the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .
with the exception of bilingual editions of the two pre-eminent arabic poets , adonis from syria and mahmoud darwwih from palestine -lrb- both from the amman verlag -rrb- , german publishers have been hesitant to offer more poetry works .
fear no classics among the big-name german publishers , c.h. beck undoubtedly has the strongest oriental program .
its " new oriental library , " designed for bibliophiles but nonetheless affordable , is currently the only book series in the german language that offers a home to the great classics of islamic culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illuminated manuscript page from the koran , in the british library all of the other publishers focus their efforts almost exclusively on modern authors .
it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .
the choice of the arab world as guest region at this year 's frankfurt book fair calls for a certain amount of curiosity , openness and willingness to experiment on the part of all those involved : book dealers , critics , literary event organizers , publishers and , last but not least , readers .
they will be richly rewarded with the discovery of a new literary continent , which promises to captivate for years to come and which might very well hold plenty of surprises in store for the future . stefan weidner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all .
-lrb- sept .
29 , 2004 -rrb- building bridges with books building a bridge between the middle east and the west is no small task , but its something the organizers of this year 's book fair in frankfurt hope to accomplish .
can literature and commerce do the job ?

munich came out 2-1 in the end , going in front through a michael ballack header in the 20th minute which looked suspiciously like a foul on the challenging bremen player miroslav klose .
the first half saw poor displays from both teams and plenty of brutal challenges beginning as early as the third minute when frank fahrenhorst clashed with ballack 's elbow and left the field with blood streaming from his nose .
the germany national player did not return , making straight for the hospital instead .
there was precious little ball play in the first 20 minutes , but fans of all-in wrestling will have thoroughly enjoyed what action did materialize with five yellow cards in total being waved in the tempestuous first half .
bayern 's felix magath chose to change the winning team which beat ajax amsterdam 4-0 in midweek , opting for sebastian deisler as a fifth midfielder at the expense of front man claudio pizarro .
otherwise , it was business as usual at the back with a defense including sammy kuffour and hasan salihamidzic who sought to deal with the threat posed by in-form miroslav klose and croatia hitman ivan klasnic , while owen hargreaves was charged with containing france playmaker johan micoud .
teams choose physicality over creativity bremen looked lackluster and could only count a borowski drive midway through the first half and a glaring klasnic miss on the half-hour as their best chances of the opening 45 minutes .
bayern were hardly any better but had more chances , mostly coming from ballack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack overcame the constant boos to open bayern 's account .
the germany captain saw an angled header saved by home keeper reinke after nine minutes and later side-footed wide with only reinke to beat .
greek hero inspires early bremen pressure werder came out fighting for the second period and the visitors were on the back foot for a good few minutes .
bremen coach thomas schaaf introduced greece euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas for klasnic after the break and the champions immediately piled on the pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valerien ismael was lively in the second half but could n't rally bremen .
werder had scored thirteen of their fourteen league goals in the second 45 minutes , and kahn was swiftly forced into two brave stops within a minute from france defender valerien ismaël -lrb- photo -rrb- .
charisteas was proving a thorn in bayern 's side until felix magath brought his defensive tactics into operation in a bid to neutralize the tall greek striker and his fellow invigorated attackers .
magath sent on martin demichelis and bastian schweinsteiger for deisler and frings to stiffen the rearguard before the hour , prompting schaaf to throw on nelson valdez as a third striker .
bad luck befalls bremen while schweinsteiger was supposed to prevent bremen from scoring , he was instrumental in bayern 's second goal .
a cross from roy makaay skewed into michael ballack 's path in front of goal but the midfielder 's shot was blocked .
the ball spun out to schweinsteiger whose own shot skimmed off christian schulz and arced around andreas reinke to give bayern a 2-0 lead .
but werder were not finished yet and klose guaranteed a dramatic last ten minutes with a trademark headed goal from magnin 's 81st minute free-kick .
the looping cross evaded a bayern defense which could be accused of ball watching for the bremen striker to steal in a nod the ball past oli kahn to set a dramatic finale .
in the end , bayern hung on to claim the three points and exacted revenge for a painful title-clinching home defeat to bremen last term , leapfrogging the champions in the standings in the process .

munich came out 2-1 in the end , going in front through a michael ballack header in the 20th minute which looked suspiciously like a foul on the challenging bremen player miroslav klose .
the first half saw poor displays from both teams and plenty of brutal challenges beginning as early as the third minute when frank fahrenhorst clashed with ballack 's elbow and left the field with blood streaming from his nose .
the germany national player did not return , making straight for the hospital instead .
there was precious little ball play in the first 20 minutes , but fans of all-in wrestling will have thoroughly enjoyed what action did materialize with five yellow cards in total being waved in the tempestuous first half .
bayern 's felix magath chose to change the winning team which beat ajax amsterdam 4-0 in midweek , opting for sebastian deisler as a fifth midfielder at the expense of front man claudio pizarro .
otherwise , it was business as usual at the back with a defense including sammy kuffour and hasan salihamidzic who sought to deal with the threat posed by in-form miroslav klose and croatia hitman ivan klasnic , while owen hargreaves was charged with containing france playmaker johan micoud .
teams choose physicality over creativity bremen looked lackluster and could only count a borowski drive midway through the first half and a glaring klasnic miss on the half-hour as their best chances of the opening 45 minutes .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .
this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

auflage ist 1.152 seiten stark und enthält insgesamt 120.000 stichwörter as in the advertising industry , where surveys have shown that commercials using english words are lost to consumers , linguists have argued that politicians should speak in a clear and broadly understood language , avoiding jargon and foreign words .
convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .
" i think that in these cases , they 're moving in a direction that 's not very sensible in terms of future cultural developments . "
more deutsch at home not everyone need go as far as former us president john f. kennedy of the " ich bin ein berliner " fame or even more recently french president jacques chirac -lrb- " ich bin es wieder , " it 's me again -rrb- , who charmed the chancellor with his attempt at a colloquial greeting , and incorporate the local language into their speeches .
but german politicians should at least start showing that german can be used on the international stage just as readily as english or french , say the linguists .
for years , berlin has been lobbying to increase the use of german in all european institutions , with varied success .
a bit of self-confidence and more usage of the language by german politicians abroad could help those efforts . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german radio quota debate goes live one of the most debated topics at the popkomm music industry conference in berlin this week is that of a german radio quota as a means to promote german language music and artists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.10.2004 g7 says high oil price threatens economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for oil means an ever-shrinking world supply with a view to rising costs , the group of seven finance chiefs called on oil producers to help keep energy prices manageable .
meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .
while snow said he did n't fear a recession in the us as a result of the oil price , he did caution about a slowing of growth in the world economy .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet echoed those concerns , saying " all we are observing today is not encouraging . "
the euro zone 's chief banker said that if oil prices continued to climb it " could certainly hamper the global economy . "
more market information in an attempt to determine why oil costs have soared to levels that now threaten growth prospects , the world 's top economic leaders called for better market data .
the g7 pressed the international energy agency , founded during the 1974 oil crisis , to improve " oil data transparency , " and to help sort out whether scarce oil supplies , speculations or rocketing demand is behind the steady rise in prices .
germany and britain are reputedly involved in negotiations for a detailed oil transparency initiative .
ahead of the g7 meeting , chancellor gerhard schröder said he believed speculation was one of the main reasons for soaring prices and that a better overview of the market through increased information could improve the situation .
bildunterschrift : supplies can not meet up with the growing demand for oil little power to change price better information and calls for increased production will most likely do very little in bringing down the oil price .
analysts say the g7 has little influence over the oil market .
the problem is one of simple economics , they point out : demand is outpacing supply , said nariman behravesh , chief economist at the economic research firm global insight .
" it 's not as if opec is manipulating the market .
there 's really not much anybody can do until the investments now being made bring some fruit , " he added .
the g7 may be effective in currency markets , but they have no real history in the oil markets .
in all reality , the price of oil will only come down when the supply improves and global growth begins to slow . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for oil market transparency in the face of record high oil prices , germany and britain are expected at the g7 meeting on friday in washington to propose measures to make world oil markets more transparent .

the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .

the decision will be viewed as a victory in turkey , which has been on a reform drive in past years to fulfill eu accession criteria . but , brussels ' formal decision next week is not expected to silence the at times bitter and divisive debate within the eu on whether turkey should be invited to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish immigrants dressed in traditional costume during carnival in cologne , germany the eu is expected to cite 2015 as the first realistic date at which turkey could enter the 25-nation bloc .
both opponents and proponents of ankara 's membership bid are thus likely to dig in their heels for years to come and thrash out the pros and cons of the large muslim-dominated nation joining the bloc . harmful debate but some fear that the debate on eu membership for turkey is not just outdated , but also harmful . erhard busek , coordinator of the stability and growth pact for south-eastern europe said ever since the decision of the eu summit in 2002 , it 's been clear that turkey would get a full-fledged membership and not an alternative form of cooperation with the eu as skeptics are demanding . " one can debate about turkey .
but , in reality , the issue has already been decided , " busek told deutsche welle .
" the only problem is that the individual governments and leaders in the eu have n't explained the issue well in their home countries .
and that could cause a number of difficulties , " he said . eu at the end of its tether bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok however , german eu parliamentarian and member of the conservative evp , elmar brok , said he saw difficulties elsewhere . brok said the european union was at the end of its tether after the last large wave of expansion - where ten mainly former communist eastern european countries joined the bloc - and the tough negotiations over a constitution .
consolidation is now on the agenda ; the eu must focus on internal stabilization , brok said . " i do n't want the current 25-member union once again disintegrating into various categories , " brok said .
" but rather , the constitution which we agreed upon in summer , should also have some substance .
but it can only have that if the eu has internal negotiating capacity , " he added .
" it 's of no use to allow the eu to just become bigger and along with it , internally weaker . " eu full up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva , bulgarian minister for european affairs , right with european commission president romano prodi and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen but it 's already clear that eu expansion is n't going to stop at the entry of the ten eastern european nations .
bulgaria and romania have already been promised entries by 2007 . according to elmar brok , the two countries differ from turkey as far as membership goes .
" in the case of romania and bulgaria , entry negotiations have almost been concluded .
here , if they satisfy entry criteria by 2007 , the eu has to fulfill its promises of membership , " brok said .
" but it also shows that we 're full up .
and that 's why we need to apply the brakes here -lrb- in turkey 's case -rrb- . " at the latest , after croatia 's entry , the eu must ask itself whether it wants to expand further at all , brok said .
he added that in turkey 's case , one should n't make overhasty mistakes but rather take time and see whether both sides had done their homework in two to three years . leaving the past behind but , even though romania and bulgaria 's entry into the eu look like a done deal , the perception there is that enlargement euphoria in the eu has largely evaporated . maria ligor of the romanian foreign ministry said she reckoned that brussels would pay more stringent attention to whether her country was fulfilling the enlargement criteria than has been the case with the current new members . ligor is clear , however , that bucharest would have no fundamental doubts against turkey 's eu entry as long as the country met the necessary criteria .
she said that negative emotions such as memories of the ottoman empire were a thing of the past . " the relationship to turkey has been strongly transformed .
we work closely together with turkey , especially in the south-eastern european region , in the black sea region , " ligor said .

" eu full up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva , bulgarian minister for european affairs , right with european commission president romano prodi and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen but it 's already clear that eu expansion is n't going to stop at the entry of the ten eastern european nations .
bulgaria and romania have already been promised entries by 2007 . according to elmar brok , the two countries differ from turkey as far as membership goes .
" in the case of romania and bulgaria , entry negotiations have almost been concluded .
here , if they satisfy entry criteria by 2007 , the eu has to fulfill its promises of membership , " brok said .
" but it also shows that we 're full up .
and that 's why we need to apply the brakes here -lrb- in turkey 's case -rrb- . " at the latest , after croatia 's entry , the eu must ask itself whether it wants to expand further at all , brok said .
he added that in turkey 's case , one should n't make overhasty mistakes but rather take time and see whether both sides had done their homework in two to three years . leaving the past behind but , even though romania and bulgaria 's entry into the eu look like a done deal , the perception there is that enlargement euphoria in the eu has largely evaporated . maria ligor of the romanian foreign ministry said she reckoned that brussels would pay more stringent attention to whether her country was fulfilling the enlargement criteria than has been the case with the current new members . ligor is clear , however , that bucharest would have no fundamental doubts against turkey 's eu entry as long as the country met the necessary criteria .
she said that negative emotions such as memories of the ottoman empire were a thing of the past . " the relationship to turkey has been strongly transformed .
we work closely together with turkey , especially in the south-eastern european region , in the black sea region , " ligor said .
" what 's important is to drive forward the democratization process in the caucasus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.10.2004 g7 says high oil price threatens economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for oil means an ever-shrinking world supply with a view to rising costs , the group of seven finance chiefs called on oil producers to help keep energy prices manageable .
meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .
while snow said he did n't fear a recession in the us as a result of the oil price , he did caution about a slowing of growth in the world economy .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet echoed those concerns , saying " all we are observing today is not encouraging . "
the euro zone 's chief banker said that if oil prices continued to climb it " could certainly hamper the global economy . "
more market information in an attempt to determine why oil costs have soared to levels that now threaten growth prospects , the world 's top economic leaders called for better market data .
the g7 pressed the international energy agency , founded during the 1974 oil crisis , to improve " oil data transparency , " and to help sort out whether scarce oil supplies , speculations or rocketing demand is behind the steady rise in prices .
germany and britain are reputedly involved in negotiations for a detailed oil transparency initiative .
ahead of the g7 meeting , chancellor gerhard schröder said he believed speculation was one of the main reasons for soaring prices and that a better overview of the market through increased information could improve the situation .
bildunterschrift : supplies can not meet up with the growing demand for oil little power to change price better information and calls for increased production will most likely do very little in bringing down the oil price .
analysts say the g7 has little influence over the oil market .
the problem is one of simple economics , they point out : demand is outpacing supply , said nariman behravesh , chief economist at the economic research firm global insight .
" it 's not as if opec is manipulating the market .
there 's really not much anybody can do until the investments now being made bring some fruit , " he added .
the g7 may be effective in currency markets , but they have no real history in the oil markets .
in all reality , the price of oil will only come down when the supply improves and global growth begins to slow . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for oil market transparency in the face of record high oil prices , germany and britain are expected at the g7 meeting on friday in washington to propose measures to make world oil markets more transparent .
-lrb- sept .
30 , 2004 -rrb- oil prices reach record high oil prices soared to a new record on tuesday , breaking through the psychologically important $ 50 -lrb- € 40.67 -rrb- per barrel mark .
experts say the new high was pushed by political instability in nigeria .

munich came out 2-1 in the end , going in front through a michael ballack header in the 20th minute which looked suspiciously like a foul on the challenging bremen player miroslav klose .
the first half saw poor displays from both teams and plenty of brutal challenges beginning as early as the third minute when frank fahrenhorst clashed with ballack 's elbow and left the field with blood streaming from his nose .
the germany national player did not return , making straight for the hospital instead .
there was precious little ball play in the first 20 minutes , but fans of all-in wrestling will have thoroughly enjoyed what action did materialize with five yellow cards in total being waved in the tempestuous first half .
bayern 's felix magath chose to change the winning team which beat ajax amsterdam 4-0 in midweek , opting for sebastian deisler as a fifth midfielder at the expense of front man claudio pizarro .
otherwise , it was business as usual at the back with a defense including sammy kuffour and hasan salihamidzic who sought to deal with the threat posed by in-form miroslav klose and croatia hitman ivan klasnic , while owen hargreaves was charged with containing france playmaker johan micoud .
teams choose physicality over creativity bremen looked lackluster and could only count a borowski drive midway through the first half and a glaring klasnic miss on the half-hour as their best chances of the opening 45 minutes .
bayern were hardly any better but had more chances , mostly coming from ballack .

werder had scored thirteen of their fourteen league goals in the second 45 minutes , and kahn was swiftly forced into two brave stops within a minute from france defender valerien ismaël -lrb- photo -rrb- .
charisteas was proving a thorn in bayern 's side until felix magath brought his defensive tactics into operation in a bid to neutralize the tall greek striker and his fellow invigorated attackers .
magath sent on martin demichelis and bastian schweinsteiger for deisler and frings to stiffen the rearguard before the hour , prompting schaaf to throw on nelson valdez as a third striker .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .

23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 02.10.2004 bayern turns up heat with win in bremen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scrappy game full of yellow cards finally came alive near the end it was n't pretty but bayern munich claimed a victory over arch rivals werder bremen on saturday , moving up to third in the league with a 2-1 win . a capacity 43,000 crowd at the weser stadium saw werder bremen take on bayern munich in a physical game punctuated by six yellow cards and two debatable goals .
munich came out 2-1 in the end , going in front through a michael ballack header in the 20th minute which looked suspiciously like a foul on the challenging bremen player miroslav klose .
the first half saw poor displays from both teams and plenty of brutal challenges beginning as early as the third minute when frank fahrenhorst clashed with ballack 's elbow and left the field with blood streaming from his nose .
the germany national player did not return , making straight for the hospital instead .
there was precious little ball play in the first 20 minutes , but fans of all-in wrestling will have thoroughly enjoyed what action did materialize with five yellow cards in total being waved in the tempestuous first half .
bayern 's felix magath chose to change the winning team which beat ajax amsterdam 4-0 in midweek , opting for sebastian deisler as a fifth midfielder at the expense of front man claudio pizarro .
otherwise , it was business as usual at the back with a defense including sammy kuffour and hasan salihamidzic who sought to deal with the threat posed by in-form miroslav klose and croatia hitman ivan klasnic , while owen hargreaves was charged with containing france playmaker johan micoud .
teams choose physicality over creativity bremen looked lackluster and could only count a borowski drive midway through the first half and a glaring klasnic miss on the half-hour as their best chances of the opening 45 minutes .
bayern were hardly any better but had more chances , mostly coming from ballack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack overcame the constant boos to open bayern 's account .
the germany captain saw an angled header saved by home keeper reinke after nine minutes and later side-footed wide with only reinke to beat .
greek hero inspires early bremen pressure werder came out fighting for the second period and the visitors were on the back foot for a good few minutes .
bremen coach thomas schaaf introduced greece euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas for klasnic after the break and the champions immediately piled on the pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valerien ismael was lively in the second half but could n't rally bremen .
werder had scored thirteen of their fourteen league goals in the second 45 minutes , and kahn was swiftly forced into two brave stops within a minute from france defender valerien ismaël -lrb- photo -rrb- .
charisteas was proving a thorn in bayern 's side until felix magath brought his defensive tactics into operation in a bid to neutralize the tall greek striker and his fellow invigorated attackers .
magath sent on martin demichelis and bastian schweinsteiger for deisler and frings to stiffen the rearguard before the hour , prompting schaaf to throw on nelson valdez as a third striker .
bad luck befalls bremen while schweinsteiger was supposed to prevent bremen from scoring , he was instrumental in bayern 's second goal .
a cross from roy makaay skewed into michael ballack 's path in front of goal but the midfielder 's shot was blocked .
the ball spun out to schweinsteiger whose own shot skimmed off christian schulz and arced around andreas reinke to give bayern a 2-0 lead .
but werder were not finished yet and klose guaranteed a dramatic last ten minutes with a trademark headed goal from magnin 's 81st minute free-kick .
the looping cross evaded a bayern defense which could be accused of ball watching for the bremen striker to steal in a nod the ball past oli kahn to set a dramatic finale .
in the end , bayern hung on to claim the three points and exacted revenge for a painful title-clinching home defeat to bremen last term , leapfrogging the champions in the standings in the process .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valerien ismael was lively in the second half but could n't rally bremen .
werder had scored thirteen of their fourteen league goals in the second 45 minutes , and kahn was swiftly forced into two brave stops within a minute from france defender valerien ismaël -lrb- photo -rrb- .
charisteas was proving a thorn in bayern 's side until felix magath brought his defensive tactics into operation in a bid to neutralize the tall greek striker and his fellow invigorated attackers .
magath sent on martin demichelis and bastian schweinsteiger for deisler and frings to stiffen the rearguard before the hour , prompting schaaf to throw on nelson valdez as a third striker .
bad luck befalls bremen while schweinsteiger was supposed to prevent bremen from scoring , he was instrumental in bayern 's second goal .
a cross from roy makaay skewed into michael ballack 's path in front of goal but the midfielder 's shot was blocked .
the ball spun out to schweinsteiger whose own shot skimmed off christian schulz and arced around andreas reinke to give bayern a 2-0 lead .
but werder were not finished yet and klose guaranteed a dramatic last ten minutes with a trademark headed goal from magnin 's 81st minute free-kick .
the looping cross evaded a bayern defense which could be accused of ball watching for the bremen striker to steal in a nod the ball past oli kahn to set a dramatic finale .
in the end , bayern hung on to claim the three points and exacted revenge for a painful title-clinching home defeat to bremen last term , leapfrogging the champions in the standings in the process .

ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .
this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mit 5.000 neuen wörtern ist am freitag der neue duden in die buchläden gekommen .
die 22 .
auflage ist 1.152 seiten stark und enthält insgesamt 120.000 stichwörter as in the advertising industry , where surveys have shown that commercials using english words are lost to consumers , linguists have argued that politicians should speak in a clear and broadly understood language , avoiding jargon and foreign words .
convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .
" i think that in these cases , they 're moving in a direction that 's not very sensible in terms of future cultural developments . "
more deutsch at home not everyone need go as far as former us president john f. kennedy of the " ich bin ein berliner " fame or even more recently french president jacques chirac -lrb- " ich bin es wieder , " it 's me again -rrb- , who charmed the chancellor with his attempt at a colloquial greeting , and incorporate the local language into their speeches .
but german politicians should at least start showing that german can be used on the international stage just as readily as english or french , say the linguists .
for years , berlin has been lobbying to increase the use of german in all european institutions , with varied success .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .
this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .
" i think that in these cases , they 're moving in a direction that 's not very sensible in terms of future cultural developments . "

but german politicians should at least start showing that german can be used on the international stage just as readily as english or french , say the linguists .

meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .
while snow said he did n't fear a recession in the us as a result of the oil price , he did caution about a slowing of growth in the world economy .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet echoed those concerns , saying " all we are observing today is not encouraging . "
the euro zone 's chief banker said that if oil prices continued to climb it " could certainly hamper the global economy . "

germany and britain are reputedly involved in negotiations for a detailed oil transparency initiative .

the decision will be viewed as a victory in turkey , which has been on a reform drive in past years to fulfill eu accession criteria . but , brussels ' formal decision next week is not expected to silence the at times bitter and divisive debate within the eu on whether turkey should be invited to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish immigrants dressed in traditional costume during carnival in cologne , germany the eu is expected to cite 2015 as the first realistic date at which turkey could enter the 25-nation bloc .
both opponents and proponents of ankara 's membership bid are thus likely to dig in their heels for years to come and thrash out the pros and cons of the large muslim-dominated nation joining the bloc . harmful debate but some fear that the debate on eu membership for turkey is not just outdated , but also harmful . erhard busek , coordinator of the stability and growth pact for south-eastern europe said ever since the decision of the eu summit in 2002 , it 's been clear that turkey would get a full-fledged membership and not an alternative form of cooperation with the eu as skeptics are demanding . " one can debate about turkey .
but , in reality , the issue has already been decided , " busek told deutsche welle .
" the only problem is that the individual governments and leaders in the eu have n't explained the issue well in their home countries .
and that could cause a number of difficulties , " he said . eu at the end of its tether bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok however , german eu parliamentarian and member of the conservative evp , elmar brok , said he saw difficulties elsewhere . brok said the european union was at the end of its tether after the last large wave of expansion - where ten mainly former communist eastern european countries joined the bloc - and the tough negotiations over a constitution .
consolidation is now on the agenda ; the eu must focus on internal stabilization , brok said . " i do n't want the current 25-member union once again disintegrating into various categories , " brok said .
" but rather , the constitution which we agreed upon in summer , should also have some substance .
but it can only have that if the eu has internal negotiating capacity , " he added .
" it 's of no use to allow the eu to just become bigger and along with it , internally weaker . " eu full up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva , bulgarian minister for european affairs , right with european commission president romano prodi and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen but it 's already clear that eu expansion is n't going to stop at the entry of the ten eastern european nations .
bulgaria and romania have already been promised entries by 2007 . according to elmar brok , the two countries differ from turkey as far as membership goes .
" in the case of romania and bulgaria , entry negotiations have almost been concluded .
here , if they satisfy entry criteria by 2007 , the eu has to fulfill its promises of membership , " brok said .
" but it also shows that we 're full up .
and that 's why we need to apply the brakes here -lrb- in turkey 's case -rrb- . " at the latest , after croatia 's entry , the eu must ask itself whether it wants to expand further at all , brok said .
he added that in turkey 's case , one should n't make overhasty mistakes but rather take time and see whether both sides had done their homework in two to three years . leaving the past behind but , even though romania and bulgaria 's entry into the eu look like a done deal , the perception there is that enlargement euphoria in the eu has largely evaporated . maria ligor of the romanian foreign ministry said she reckoned that brussels would pay more stringent attention to whether her country was fulfilling the enlargement criteria than has been the case with the current new members . ligor is clear , however , that bucharest would have no fundamental doubts against turkey 's eu entry as long as the country met the necessary criteria .
she said that negative emotions such as memories of the ottoman empire were a thing of the past . " the relationship to turkey has been strongly transformed .
we work closely together with turkey , especially in the south-eastern european region , in the black sea region , " ligor said .
" what 's important is to drive forward the democratization process in the caucasus .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .
this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mit 5.000 neuen wörtern ist am freitag der neue duden in die buchläden gekommen .
die 22 .
auflage ist 1.152 seiten stark und enthält insgesamt 120.000 stichwörter as in the advertising industry , where surveys have shown that commercials using english words are lost to consumers , linguists have argued that politicians should speak in a clear and broadly understood language , avoiding jargon and foreign words .
convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .
" i think that in these cases , they 're moving in a direction that 's not very sensible in terms of future cultural developments . "
more deutsch at home not everyone need go as far as former us president john f. kennedy of the " ich bin ein berliner " fame or even more recently french president jacques chirac -lrb- " ich bin es wieder , " it 's me again -rrb- , who charmed the chancellor with his attempt at a colloquial greeting , and incorporate the local language into their speeches .
but german politicians should at least start showing that german can be used on the international stage just as readily as english or french , say the linguists .
for years , berlin has been lobbying to increase the use of german in all european institutions , with varied success .

speaking english is no longer a must . in new york last week , german foreign minister joschka fisscher delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly .
it was n't the first time the statesman had done so , but until now , he 's always spoken in english , without exception .
this time he made his first official speech abroad in german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

convoluted political phrases like the " brain up " slogan coined by the education ministry to describe a program for elite universities mean nothing to the german people and only get laughs from those who understand enough english to know it makes no sense .
" we 've actually observed over a length of time that a range of ministries seem to want to distinguish themselves by the use of english , new-english or new-german english , " language expert ehlich noted .
" i think that in these cases , they 're moving in a direction that 's not very sensible in terms of future cultural developments . "

but german politicians should at least start showing that german can be used on the international stage just as readily as english or french , say the linguists .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the united nations general assembly in new york , thursday sept .
23 , 2004 .
perhaps fischer had heard that german language specialists had a bone to pick with him .
at the recent germanistentag in munich , german studies experts and language researchers called upon politicians to start holding their speeches in german when abroad as a sign of confidence in their mother tongue .
" it 's not about whether or not our politicians speak english well , " said konrad ehlich , a linguist and attendee at the conference .
" it simply has to do with the question of how german policies are presented , and how german politicians present themselves in an international political market , which is also a language market , " he told deutsche welle .
language flexibility the german linguists demands , however , have not met with acceptance among all of the country 's politicians .
the german minister for economic cooperation and development , for instance , said she has no intention of letting anyone dictate what to say or how to say it .
" the language specialists can decide whatever they want for themselves .
i sometimes speak german , and sometimes english , according to what the situation requires , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" i do n't think there are any general rules about it , " she added in perfect english .
even though the ministers and politicians may go back and forth comfortably between the two languages , the chancellor prefers to speak in german .
at international conferences and on official visits , even at press conferences with foreign journalists , gerhard schröder delivers his speeches in german and has an interpreter .
government spokesman bela anda explained schröder 's tendency to speak in his native language .
" nuances , which are very important in politics , can be expressed better when he speaks german and lets a specialist translate . "
interpreters also prefer when politicians speak their mother tongue .
" it 's better that they speak german with a good interpreter than speaking english with a bad accent , and we have trouble understanding it , " said martine bolomey , who often interprets schröder into english .
embarrassing denglisch it might not be a bad idea if the chancellor recommended that more ministers switch to german , not only abroad but at home as well .
too often , when the politicians want an issue or a new project to sound particularly with-the-times , they revert to using terms that sound a bit like english , but for native speakers are nothing of the kind .

the decision will be viewed as a victory in turkey , which has been on a reform drive in past years to fulfill eu accession criteria . but , brussels ' formal decision next week is not expected to silence the at times bitter and divisive debate within the eu on whether turkey should be invited to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish immigrants dressed in traditional costume during carnival in cologne , germany the eu is expected to cite 2015 as the first realistic date at which turkey could enter the 25-nation bloc .
both opponents and proponents of ankara 's membership bid are thus likely to dig in their heels for years to come and thrash out the pros and cons of the large muslim-dominated nation joining the bloc . harmful debate but some fear that the debate on eu membership for turkey is not just outdated , but also harmful . erhard busek , coordinator of the stability and growth pact for south-eastern europe said ever since the decision of the eu summit in 2002 , it 's been clear that turkey would get a full-fledged membership and not an alternative form of cooperation with the eu as skeptics are demanding . " one can debate about turkey .
but , in reality , the issue has already been decided , " busek told deutsche welle .
" the only problem is that the individual governments and leaders in the eu have n't explained the issue well in their home countries .
and that could cause a number of difficulties , " he said . eu at the end of its tether bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok however , german eu parliamentarian and member of the conservative evp , elmar brok , said he saw difficulties elsewhere . brok said the european union was at the end of its tether after the last large wave of expansion - where ten mainly former communist eastern european countries joined the bloc - and the tough negotiations over a constitution .
consolidation is now on the agenda ; the eu must focus on internal stabilization , brok said . " i do n't want the current 25-member union once again disintegrating into various categories , " brok said .
" but rather , the constitution which we agreed upon in summer , should also have some substance .
but it can only have that if the eu has internal negotiating capacity , " he added .
" it 's of no use to allow the eu to just become bigger and along with it , internally weaker . " eu full up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meglena kuneva , bulgarian minister for european affairs , right with european commission president romano prodi and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen but it 's already clear that eu expansion is n't going to stop at the entry of the ten eastern european nations .
bulgaria and romania have already been promised entries by 2007 . according to elmar brok , the two countries differ from turkey as far as membership goes .
" in the case of romania and bulgaria , entry negotiations have almost been concluded .
here , if they satisfy entry criteria by 2007 , the eu has to fulfill its promises of membership , " brok said .
" but it also shows that we 're full up .
and that 's why we need to apply the brakes here -lrb- in turkey 's case -rrb- . " at the latest , after croatia 's entry , the eu must ask itself whether it wants to expand further at all , brok said .
he added that in turkey 's case , one should n't make overhasty mistakes but rather take time and see whether both sides had done their homework in two to three years . leaving the past behind but , even though romania and bulgaria 's entry into the eu look like a done deal , the perception there is that enlargement euphoria in the eu has largely evaporated . maria ligor of the romanian foreign ministry said she reckoned that brussels would pay more stringent attention to whether her country was fulfilling the enlargement criteria than has been the case with the current new members . ligor is clear , however , that bucharest would have no fundamental doubts against turkey 's eu entry as long as the country met the necessary criteria .
she said that negative emotions such as memories of the ottoman empire were a thing of the past . " the relationship to turkey has been strongly transformed .
we work closely together with turkey , especially in the south-eastern european region , in the black sea region , " ligor said .
" what 's important is to drive forward the democratization process in the caucasus .
the new relationship has pushed the past into the shadows . " klaus dahmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth after years of waiting , turkey says it 's ready to join the european union .

munich came out 2-1 in the end , going in front through a michael ballack header in the 20th minute which looked suspiciously like a foul on the challenging bremen player miroslav klose .
the first half saw poor displays from both teams and plenty of brutal challenges beginning as early as the third minute when frank fahrenhorst clashed with ballack 's elbow and left the field with blood streaming from his nose .
the germany national player did not return , making straight for the hospital instead .
there was precious little ball play in the first 20 minutes , but fans of all-in wrestling will have thoroughly enjoyed what action did materialize with five yellow cards in total being waved in the tempestuous first half .
bayern 's felix magath chose to change the winning team which beat ajax amsterdam 4-0 in midweek , opting for sebastian deisler as a fifth midfielder at the expense of front man claudio pizarro .
otherwise , it was business as usual at the back with a defense including sammy kuffour and hasan salihamidzic who sought to deal with the threat posed by in-form miroslav klose and croatia hitman ivan klasnic , while owen hargreaves was charged with containing france playmaker johan micoud .
teams choose physicality over creativity bremen looked lackluster and could only count a borowski drive midway through the first half and a glaring klasnic miss on the half-hour as their best chances of the opening 45 minutes .
bayern were hardly any better but had more chances , mostly coming from ballack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack overcame the constant boos to open bayern 's account .
the germany captain saw an angled header saved by home keeper reinke after nine minutes and later side-footed wide with only reinke to beat .
greek hero inspires early bremen pressure werder came out fighting for the second period and the visitors were on the back foot for a good few minutes .
bremen coach thomas schaaf introduced greece euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas for klasnic after the break and the champions immediately piled on the pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valerien ismael was lively in the second half but could n't rally bremen .
werder had scored thirteen of their fourteen league goals in the second 45 minutes , and kahn was swiftly forced into two brave stops within a minute from france defender valerien ismaël -lrb- photo -rrb- .
charisteas was proving a thorn in bayern 's side until felix magath brought his defensive tactics into operation in a bid to neutralize the tall greek striker and his fellow invigorated attackers .
magath sent on martin demichelis and bastian schweinsteiger for deisler and frings to stiffen the rearguard before the hour , prompting schaaf to throw on nelson valdez as a third striker .
bad luck befalls bremen while schweinsteiger was supposed to prevent bremen from scoring , he was instrumental in bayern 's second goal .
a cross from roy makaay skewed into michael ballack 's path in front of goal but the midfielder 's shot was blocked .
the ball spun out to schweinsteiger whose own shot skimmed off christian schulz and arced around andreas reinke to give bayern a 2-0 lead .
but werder were not finished yet and klose guaranteed a dramatic last ten minutes with a trademark headed goal from magnin 's 81st minute free-kick .
the looping cross evaded a bayern defense which could be accused of ball watching for the bremen striker to steal in a nod the ball past oli kahn to set a dramatic finale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 2004 frankfurt book fair book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent the healing power of storytelling the unknown guest of honor frankfurt book fair opens culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2004 opinion : open , sesame ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a world of books waits to be discovered when the frankfurt book fair opens next week , the guest of honor will be the arab world .
the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .

the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .

but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .

the decision will be viewed as a victory in turkey , which has been on a reform drive in past years to fulfill eu accession criteria . but , brussels ' formal decision next week is not expected to silence the at times bitter and divisive debate within the eu on whether turkey should be invited to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish immigrants dressed in traditional costume during carnival in cologne , germany the eu is expected to cite 2015 as the first realistic date at which turkey could enter the 25-nation bloc .
both opponents and proponents of ankara 's membership bid are thus likely to dig in their heels for years to come and thrash out the pros and cons of the large muslim-dominated nation joining the bloc . harmful debate but some fear that the debate on eu membership for turkey is not just outdated , but also harmful . erhard busek , coordinator of the stability and growth pact for south-eastern europe said ever since the decision of the eu summit in 2002 , it 's been clear that turkey would get a full-fledged membership and not an alternative form of cooperation with the eu as skeptics are demanding . " one can debate about turkey .
but , in reality , the issue has already been decided , " busek told deutsche welle .
" the only problem is that the individual governments and leaders in the eu have n't explained the issue well in their home countries .
and that could cause a number of difficulties , " he said . eu at the end of its tether bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elmar brok however , german eu parliamentarian and member of the conservative evp , elmar brok , said he saw difficulties elsewhere . brok said the european union was at the end of its tether after the last large wave of expansion - where ten mainly former communist eastern european countries joined the bloc - and the tough negotiations over a constitution .
consolidation is now on the agenda ; the eu must focus on internal stabilization , brok said . " i do n't want the current 25-member union once again disintegrating into various categories , " brok said .
" but rather , the constitution which we agreed upon in summer , should also have some substance .
but it can only have that if the eu has internal negotiating capacity , " he added .
" it 's of no use to allow the eu to just become bigger and along with it , internally weaker .

bulgaria and romania have already been promised entries by 2007 . according to elmar brok , the two countries differ from turkey as far as membership goes .
" in the case of romania and bulgaria , entry negotiations have almost been concluded .
here , if they satisfy entry criteria by 2007 , the eu has to fulfill its promises of membership , " brok said .
" but it also shows that we 're full up .
and that 's why we need to apply the brakes here -lrb- in turkey 's case -rrb- . " at the latest , after croatia 's entry , the eu must ask itself whether it wants to expand further at all , brok said .
he added that in turkey 's case , one should n't make overhasty mistakes but rather take time and see whether both sides had done their homework in two to three years . leaving the past behind but , even though romania and bulgaria 's entry into the eu look like a done deal , the perception there is that enlargement euphoria in the eu has largely evaporated . maria ligor of the romanian foreign ministry said she reckoned that brussels would pay more stringent attention to whether her country was fulfilling the enlargement criteria than has been the case with the current new members . ligor is clear , however , that bucharest would have no fundamental doubts against turkey 's eu entry as long as the country met the necessary criteria .
she said that negative emotions such as memories of the ottoman empire were a thing of the past . " the relationship to turkey has been strongly transformed .
we work closely together with turkey , especially in the south-eastern european region , in the black sea region , " ligor said .

he added that in turkey 's case , one should n't make overhasty mistakes but rather take time and see whether both sides had done their homework in two to three years . leaving the past behind but , even though romania and bulgaria 's entry into the eu look like a done deal , the perception there is that enlargement euphoria in the eu has largely evaporated . maria ligor of the romanian foreign ministry said she reckoned that brussels would pay more stringent attention to whether her country was fulfilling the enlargement criteria than has been the case with the current new members . ligor is clear , however , that bucharest would have no fundamental doubts against turkey 's eu entry as long as the country met the necessary criteria .
she said that negative emotions such as memories of the ottoman empire were a thing of the past . " the relationship to turkey has been strongly transformed .
we work closely together with turkey , especially in the south-eastern european region , in the black sea region , " ligor said .

meeting in washington , the world 's richest nations warned economic growth was at risk . although they gave general upbeat assessments for global economic prospects next year , finance ministers and central bankers from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states , expressed concern that an unchecked increase in oil prices could jeopardize growth .
" oil prices remain high and are a risk .
we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate , " they said in a statement issued after friday 's g7 meeting in washington , and added that " consumer nations had to increase their energy efficiency . "
on friday , new york crude oil futures closed at over $ 50 , the highest level ever and a 20 percent increase since the finance ministers made a similar call for higher production at a meeting in new york in may .
" we 're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements , " us treasury secretary john snow told reporters .
" that commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty , which i think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the stock price well above the fundamentals of the market , " he said .
while snow said he did n't fear a recession in the us as a result of the oil price , he did caution about a slowing of growth in the world economy .
european central bank president jean-claude trichet echoed those concerns , saying " all we are observing today is not encouraging . "
the euro zone 's chief banker said that if oil prices continued to climb it " could certainly hamper the global economy . "
more market information in an attempt to determine why oil costs have soared to levels that now threaten growth prospects , the world 's top economic leaders called for better market data .
the g7 pressed the international energy agency , founded during the 1974 oil crisis , to improve " oil data transparency , " and to help sort out whether scarce oil supplies , speculations or rocketing demand is behind the steady rise in prices .
germany and britain are reputedly involved in negotiations for a detailed oil transparency initiative .
ahead of the g7 meeting , chancellor gerhard schröder said he believed speculation was one of the main reasons for soaring prices and that a better overview of the market through increased information could improve the situation .
bildunterschrift : supplies can not meet up with the growing demand for oil little power to change price better information and calls for increased production will most likely do very little in bringing down the oil price .
analysts say the g7 has little influence over the oil market .
the problem is one of simple economics , they point out : demand is outpacing supply , said nariman behravesh , chief economist at the economic research firm global insight .
" it 's not as if opec is manipulating the market .
there 's really not much anybody can do until the investments now being made bring some fruit , " he added .
the g7 may be effective in currency markets , but they have no real history in the oil markets .

the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in . arabic literature is booming these days on the german-language book market – but no one has quite noticed it yet .
ever since egyptian writer nagib machfus was awarded the nobel prize for literature in 1988 , the number of books translated from arabic into german has grown by 10 to 20 percent .
while in the mid- ' 80s only a handful of contemporary arabic authors were available in translation , today german readers can choose from some 150 works , ranging from volumes of poetry to novels , anthologies and classics .
and this number does not even include north africans writing in french , such as tahar ben jelloun or assia djebar ; nor does it account for editions of the koran , or non-fiction books about the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stacks of books in the world 's largest bookstore , amazon.com this trend will most likely peak this fall as publishers rush to bring out their next year 's line-up to coincide with the 2004 frankfurt book fair , where the arab world is featured as guest region .
but an increase in the number of arabic books on the market does not necessarily equate with a bigger public interest .
the arab world in publishers ' fall programs even if the number of translations being commissioned is steadily growing , publishers in the german-speaking world still harbor reservations about arabic literature .
publishing houses that have always offered oriental literature such as the switzerland 's lenos verlag , amman verlag and unionsverlag , have strengthened their offerings even further .
but others , including most of the major publishers , have kept their distance or at most concentrated their efforts on non-fiction and a few big name writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookstore in northern iraq poetry , which for the arabs themselves is the most esteemed of literary genres , is underrepresented in the fall line-up .
with the exception of bilingual editions of the two pre-eminent arabic poets , adonis from syria and mahmoud darwwih from palestine -lrb- both from the amman verlag -rrb- , german publishers have been hesitant to offer more poetry works .
fear no classics among the big-name german publishers , c.h. beck undoubtedly has the strongest oriental program .
its " new oriental library , " designed for bibliophiles but nonetheless affordable , is currently the only book series in the german language that offers a home to the great classics of islamic culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illuminated manuscript page from the koran , in the british library all of the other publishers focus their efforts almost exclusively on modern authors .
it might very well be that publishing the classics is not as rewarding in terms of quick sales .
but the works appearing in the " new oriental library " indisputably belong to the great classics of world literature , and the success with which the new translation of " 1001 nights , " also by c. h. beck , was greeted shows that , with the right marketing and support from bookstores , this can also be a best-selling segment .
curiosity called for widely considered " fringe " literature among german mainstream publishers , the real problem facing arabic authors in german-speaking countries is not a lack of translations , but rather a lack of vocal proponents .
there are hardly any literary critics who specialize in oriental literature .
the neue züricher zeitung and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , leading papers in switzerland and germany , are the only newspapers that publish reviews of arabic literature with some degree of regularity .
thus , there is a danger that , although plenty of arabic books will be available this coming fall , there will be very few critics who will be working to familiarize the public with this segment of literature .
moreover , there are no overviews available to help interested book dealers , critics or readers orient themselves in the market .
the choice of the arab world as guest region at this year 's frankfurt book fair calls for a certain amount of curiosity , openness and willingness to experiment on the part of all those involved : book dealers , critics , literary event organizers , publishers and , last but not least , readers .

ukip came third in thursday 's hartlepool by-election , pushing the tories into fourth place .
the bristol conference will discuss whether to put up candidates in every constituency at a general election .
alternatively , the party may decide to stand down in those seats where the sitting mp backs its anti-eu stance .
' marvellous backdrop ' the two-day bristol conference will begin with a parade of the party 's recent election winners .
these include the 11 ukip meps who took up their seats after june 's european elections and the party 's two new london assembly members . "
if the people like what we say i am positive they will come out at the general election and will give us that support " geoffrey titford , ukip mep ukip 's leaders are confident the party can win seats at the next election , pointing out that in the european elections they came first in 22 constituencies .
however , they accept they would win nothing like that number of seats in a general election .
jeffrey titford , the party 's mep for the eastern region , said the hartlepool result - where the party was beaten only by labour and the lib dems - had given it a huge boost .

it has been organised at lee moor by the dartmoor society , which says it is the first event of its kind in devon .
representatives from the china clay firms imerys and watts blake bearne will speak at the debate , and include economic benefits in their speeches .
dartmoor national park authority 's former director , professor ian mercer , will make a case for the environment . £ 18m is a considerable economic advantage to west devon ivor bowditch , imerys people have been extracting china clay from the moor for more than 175 years .
however , in recent years , some local residents have had concerns about expansion of the china clay works .
professor mercer said the debate will be weighing up whether the loss of landscape is worth the economic gain .
he said : " we will look at how does environmental pressure and technological difficulty mount a general pressure on whether you stay doing it or whether you go somewhere else . "
ivor bowditch from imerys said the companies would listen to all arguments and respond to any concerns .
he said he wanted to highlight the fact that china clay contributes about £ 18m to the local economy with its work around lee moor employing more than 200 people .
he also said the company 's attitude to the environment was a modern one .
he said : " that £ 18m is a considerable economic advantage to west devon .
" we know critics may say there is an ecological disadvantage , but we 're trying to marry the two : the economic importance of the industry , but also to do that business in an economical and environmentally way which will allow the sustainability of the business . "
the debate is being held at the lee moor village hall .
it will be followed by a tour around nearby clay works .

traffic wardens feared vinci park 's plan to make them take breaks in public places increased the risk of abuse as they could see people they had fined .
formerly the wardens , who patrol bromley , south-east london , went to the civic centre 's staff canteen .
vinci park said it will look into other venues for staff breaks on monday .
parking attendants run a daily gauntlet of abuse and threats , and physical assaults are a regular occurrence rmt general secretary bob crow the rmt says it is open to suggestions for alternative arrangements but the emphasis was on safety .
sixteen of the 19 rmt members balloted over a possible strike voted in favour of industrial action , while three did not return a vote , the union said .
rmt general secretary bob crow said : " parking attendants run a daily gauntlet of abuse and threats , and physical assaults are a regular occurrence , yet the company imposed changes that expose our members to an increased risk of attack .
" this is a very straightforward dispute .
the company needs to understand that it can not continue to put its profits ahead of employees ' safety . "
vinci park provides all street parking attendants for the london borough of bromley .

traffic wardens feared vinci park 's plan to make them take breaks in public places increased the risk of abuse as they could see people they had fined .
formerly the wardens , who patrol bromley , south-east london , went to the civic centre 's staff canteen .
vinci park said it will look into other venues for staff breaks on monday . "
parking attendants run a daily gauntlet of abuse and threats , and physical assaults are a regular occurrence " rmt general secretary bob crow the rmt says it is open to suggestions for alternative arrangements but the emphasis was on safety .
sixteen of the 19 rmt members balloted over a possible strike voted in favour of industrial action , while three did not return a vote , the union said .
rmt general secretary bob crow said : " parking attendants run a daily gauntlet of abuse and threats , and physical assaults are a regular occurrence , yet the company imposed changes that expose our members to an increased risk of attack .
" this is a very straightforward dispute .
the company needs to understand that it can not continue to put its profits ahead of employees ' safety . "
