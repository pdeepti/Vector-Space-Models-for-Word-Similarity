the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

" so far we have coordination only with france .

they announced the results of consultations by a commission of lawyers from both countries who had concluded that german post-war claims on poland and polish demands for reparations from germany were " without foundation . "

belka said the claims would not be eligible for consideration by courts either in germany , poland or the united states .

wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .
stuttgart , who looked like championship thoroughbreds in a field of stumbling ponies just three weeks ago , have long since waved goodbye to their unbeaten record and are on a losing streak themselves . second placed schlake keep the heat on stuttgart fell victim to schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick 's resurgent title contenders in a scorcher of a match in gelsenkirchen , losing 3-2 to the royal blues .
brazilian ailton scored after just forty seconds to register his third goal in as many matches as schalke 04 recorded their fifth straight league win .
after going the first eight games unbeaten stuttgart have now lost three in a row . schalke travel to hamburg on sunday to face an hsv side on a slow rise out of the drop zone .
hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .
the southerners travel to leverkusen to face a potentially fired up bayer team out for revenge after losing to dortmund last weekend . however , the 1-1 draw which put as roma out of the champions league in midweek and helped their own chances of qualification could help leverkusen regain the more positive side of their spluttering form . borussia dortmund notched their first home win of the season over leverkusen in the 1-0 defeat , thanks to brazilian ewerthon who scored the only goal after 41 minutes .
the victory was a respite from the freefall the heavily in-debt have been suffering of late and it helped bvb hang on to 11th spot .
the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .
substitute selim teber cancelled out delron buckley 's 79th minute opener and struck a late winner to move kaiserslautern off the bottom spot and to give their under-fire boss some breathing space . kaiserslautern have the opportunity to get further out of trouble at the expense of a side in danger of going further in the opposite direction .
bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .
the 3-0 win at home to bochum continued their current renaissance and lifted them up to within four points of the summit .
it is conceivable , given their opponents loss of form of late , that hanover could keep the unexpected pressure on with another victory in week twelve . spluttering bavarian giants risk disaster bayern suffered a major setback when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
bayern 's third defeat of the campaign means they slipped to fifth , four points adrift of leaders wolfsburg .
on top of that , a 1-0 loss at home to juventus in the champions league left bayern 's european ambitions on a knife edge . munich will be without brazilian world cup winner lucio on saturday after he was dismissed in the second half of last week 's league game for stomping on czech opponent vaclav sverkos , capping a miserable afternoon for felix magath 's bavarian outfit . playing bayern in your first match in charge is not ideal but interim borussia mönchengladbach chief horst koppel , who stepped in to replace holger fach when he was sacked on wednesday , kept a cool head - and goals from marcelo pletsch and joris van hout made his job easier .
his next match in charge will be away at fsv mainz . plucky mainz off the pace mainz have seen their own season hit a lull after pushing for the top spots for the first two months .
back-to-back defeats have seen the reds slip to seventh and the spirited but ultimately futile tussle with the wolves last week . the 4-3 defeat may have dented their chances of claiming an improbable first bundesliga title but it at least showed they have the scoring ability , something they will want to exploit against ' gladbach on saturday if they 're not to slip further out of contention . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern embarrassed , wolfsburg wins goalfest bayern munich suffered a major setback ahead of wednesday 's champions league clash with juventus when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .

the information followed a short statement by a senior french military official who said " mr arafat is not dead . "
the palestinian authority president 's condition was " complex , " general christian estripeau , the spokesman for the french defence forces ' medical service , told reporters outside the paris military hospital which had been tending to arafat .
" the patient 's condition needs appropriate treatment which required his being transferred to a unit suited to his pathology on the afternoon of wednesday november 3 , " he said .
he refused to take questions , but said his statement had been prepared according to the wishes of arafat 's wife , suha .
earlier thursday , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and israeli media had reported that arafat had died .
" mr. arafat passed away a quarter of an hour ago , " juncker told reporters in brussels at 1640 gmt .
his aides later retracted the statement .
french president jacques chirac , who made an half-hour visit to the percy military training hospital where arafat had been admitted before going to brussels for an meeting with juncker and other eu leaders , refused to answer journalists ' questions as to whether arafat was dead .
palestinian officials in paris and the west bank spent the day denying the reports of arafat 's demise , but said their leader was in " critical condition " in the hospital 's intensive care unit .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qorei told reporters at his west bank headquarters in ramallah that arafat " is not in a coma . "
" there have been examinations and results are positive , " he said without elaborating .
" it is wrong .
if the president was dead , the whole world would know , " palestinian communications minister azzam al-ahmed told afp .
" but it is true that he is a very critical condition , " he added .
no diagnosis french medical sources said arafat 's health had suddenly and dramatically deteriorated wednesday while he was undergoing tests to determine the cause of an illness which prompted his medical evacuation to paris last friday .
a diagnosis of the illness has not been revealed .
palestinian officials said weekend tests had ruled out leukaemia or other cancers that might have explained the symptoms suffered by arafat , who had low levels of blood platelets needed for blood clotting .
in washington , newly re-elected us president george w. bush said " god bless his soul " when told by a reporter of the unconfirmed reports that the palestinian leader had died .
a us state department official later said : " the latest we have from the french is that he is in a criticial but semi-conscious state . "
no brain activity a french medical source said an electroencephalogram -lrb- eeg -rrb- , a type of brain scan , was carried out on arafat thursday - itself " a sign of extreme gravity " - and that there was no reading of any cerebral activity .
france has long supported arafat in his 40-year struggle for palestinian statehood , and chirac was said to have made the decision personally to provide hospital treatment for him .
arafat was said to have been well enough wednesday to welcome bush 's re-election and , according to one of his aides , said he hoped for a jumpstart to the moribund middle east peace process .
arafat 's departure from his battered west bank headquarters have sparked intense speculation about his eventual successor , but officials insist there is no power vacuum .
in arafat 's absence , qorei has taken over as acting head of the palestinian authority , while former premier mahmud abbas is temporarily heading the plo and arafat 's dominant fatah faction . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?
ailing palestinian leader yasser arafat has been flown to paris for medical treatment .

the information followed a short statement by a senior french military official who said " mr arafat is not dead . "
the palestinian authority president 's condition was " complex , " general christian estripeau , the spokesman for the french defence forces ' medical service , told reporters outside the paris military hospital which had been tending to arafat .
" the patient 's condition needs appropriate treatment which required his being transferred to a unit suited to his pathology on the afternoon of wednesday november 3 , " he said .
he refused to take questions , but said his statement had been prepared according to the wishes of arafat 's wife , suha .
earlier thursday , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and israeli media had reported that arafat had died .
" mr. arafat passed away a quarter of an hour ago , " juncker told reporters in brussels at 1640 gmt .
his aides later retracted the statement .
french president jacques chirac , who made an half-hour visit to the percy military training hospital where arafat had been admitted before going to brussels for an meeting with juncker and other eu leaders , refused to answer journalists ' questions as to whether arafat was dead .
palestinian officials in paris and the west bank spent the day denying the reports of arafat 's demise , but said their leader was in " critical condition " in the hospital 's intensive care unit .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qorei told reporters at his west bank headquarters in ramallah that arafat " is not in a coma . "
" there have been examinations and results are positive , " he said without elaborating .
" it is wrong .
if the president was dead , the whole world would know , " palestinian communications minister azzam al-ahmed told afp .
" but it is true that he is a very critical condition , " he added .
no diagnosis french medical sources said arafat 's health had suddenly and dramatically deteriorated wednesday while he was undergoing tests to determine the cause of an illness which prompted his medical evacuation to paris last friday .
a diagnosis of the illness has not been revealed .
palestinian officials said weekend tests had ruled out leukaemia or other cancers that might have explained the symptoms suffered by arafat , who had low levels of blood platelets needed for blood clotting .
in washington , newly re-elected us president george w. bush said " god bless his soul " when told by a reporter of the unconfirmed reports that the palestinian leader had died .
a us state department official later said : " the latest we have from the french is that he is in a criticial but semi-conscious state . "
no brain activity a french medical source said an electroencephalogram -lrb- eeg -rrb- , a type of brain scan , was carried out on arafat thursday - itself " a sign of extreme gravity " - and that there was no reading of any cerebral activity .
france has long supported arafat in his 40-year struggle for palestinian statehood , and chirac was said to have made the decision personally to provide hospital treatment for him .
arafat was said to have been well enough wednesday to welcome bush 's re-election and , according to one of his aides , said he hoped for a jumpstart to the moribund middle east peace process .
arafat 's departure from his battered west bank headquarters have sparked intense speculation about his eventual successor , but officials insist there is no power vacuum .

" so far we have coordination only with france .
a similar process with poland shows the equal value we attach to relations with both east and west , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new coordinator for german-polish relations , gesine schwan schröder announced the appointment of his former candidate for the german presidency , gesine schwan -lrb- photo -rrb- , as the new coordinator for relations with poland .
schwan is also the head of european university viadrina at frankfurt on oder .
belka told reporters that the polish coordinator for german relations would be irena lipowicz , formerly poland 's ambassador to austria .
reparation feud settled the two government leaders also said they have laid to rest a recent row over world war ii compensation claims .
they announced the results of consultations by a commission of lawyers from both countries who had concluded that german post-war claims on poland and polish demands for reparations from germany were " without foundation . "
" the most important factor in the -lrb- commission 's -rrb- expert opinion is that there is no legal basis for claims by one side or the other , " schroeder said .
belka said the claims would not be eligible for consideration by courts either in germany , poland or the united states .
the threats of legal action that were flying back and forth between laywers representing victims ' groups had chilled otherwise warm relations between poland and germany .
after talks last month in berlin , schroöder and belka agreed to set up a joint team of lawyers to challenge any compensation claim from germans seeking to reclaim property lost after 1945 . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reconciliation instead of reparation as tension simmers between germany and poland over world war ii compensation claims , a german journalist is trying to bring reason to the impassioned debate by urging ethnic germans to relinquish their claims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 04.11.2004 wolves open up lead in championship race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's daylight between wolfsburg and their nearest rivals at the top the close bundesliga title race is beginning to fracture .
wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .
stuttgart , who looked like championship thoroughbreds in a field of stumbling ponies just three weeks ago , have long since waved goodbye to their unbeaten record and are on a losing streak themselves . second placed schlake keep the heat on stuttgart fell victim to schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick 's resurgent title contenders in a scorcher of a match in gelsenkirchen , losing 3-2 to the royal blues .
brazilian ailton scored after just forty seconds to register his third goal in as many matches as schalke 04 recorded their fifth straight league win .
after going the first eight games unbeaten stuttgart have now lost three in a row . schalke travel to hamburg on sunday to face an hsv side on a slow rise out of the drop zone .
hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .
the southerners travel to leverkusen to face a potentially fired up bayer team out for revenge after losing to dortmund last weekend . however , the 1-1 draw which put as roma out of the champions league in midweek and helped their own chances of qualification could help leverkusen regain the more positive side of their spluttering form . borussia dortmund notched their first home win of the season over leverkusen in the 1-0 defeat , thanks to brazilian ewerthon who scored the only goal after 41 minutes .
the victory was a respite from the freefall the heavily in-debt have been suffering of late and it helped bvb hang on to 11th spot .
the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .
substitute selim teber cancelled out delron buckley 's 79th minute opener and struck a late winner to move kaiserslautern off the bottom spot and to give their under-fire boss some breathing space . kaiserslautern have the opportunity to get further out of trouble at the expense of a side in danger of going further in the opposite direction .
bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .
the 3-0 win at home to bochum continued their current renaissance and lifted them up to within four points of the summit .
it is conceivable , given their opponents loss of form of late , that hanover could keep the unexpected pressure on with another victory in week twelve . spluttering bavarian giants risk disaster bayern suffered a major setback when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
bayern 's third defeat of the campaign means they slipped to fifth , four points adrift of leaders wolfsburg .
on top of that , a 1-0 loss at home to juventus in the champions league left bayern 's european ambitions on a knife edge . munich will be without brazilian world cup winner lucio on saturday after he was dismissed in the second half of last week 's league game for stomping on czech opponent vaclav sverkos , capping a miserable afternoon for felix magath 's bavarian outfit . playing bayern in your first match in charge is not ideal but interim borussia mönchengladbach chief horst koppel , who stepped in to replace holger fach when he was sacked on wednesday , kept a cool head - and goals from marcelo pletsch and joris van hout made his job easier .
his next match in charge will be away at fsv mainz . plucky mainz off the pace mainz have seen their own season hit a lull after pushing for the top spots for the first two months .
back-to-back defeats have seen the reds slip to seventh and the spirited but ultimately futile tussle with the wolves last week . the 4-3 defeat may have dented their chances of claiming an improbable first bundesliga title but it at least showed they have the scoring ability , something they will want to exploit against ' gladbach on saturday if they 're not to slip further out of contention . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern embarrassed , wolfsburg wins goalfest bayern munich suffered a major setback ahead of wednesday 's champions league clash with juventus when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .

but chocoholics can take comfort from the good news that their guilty pleasure also has some health benefits . we 're all familiar with the theory that eating chocolate triggers the release of endorphins , natural opiates in the brain that reduce pain .

dak based the claim on a scientific study conducted by greek heart experts and presented at a recent convention in munich hosted by the association of european cardiologists .
apparently , the flavanol in cocoa reduces what 's known as cellular " oxidative stress , " which can contribute to circulatory disorders . over the years , scientists have begun to accept that the antioxidants found in cocoa can decrease the risk of coronary artery disease .
flavanols have a beneficial influence on vascular health , and cardiovascular diseases remain the number one killer in developed countries .
you know you want to but never before has an insurance firm actually advised clients to indulge their sugar cravings .

the information followed a short statement by a senior french military official who said " mr arafat is not dead . "
the palestinian authority president 's condition was " complex , " general christian estripeau , the spokesman for the french defence forces ' medical service , told reporters outside the paris military hospital which had been tending to arafat .
" the patient 's condition needs appropriate treatment which required his being transferred to a unit suited to his pathology on the afternoon of wednesday november 3 , " he said .
he refused to take questions , but said his statement had been prepared according to the wishes of arafat 's wife , suha .
earlier thursday , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and israeli media had reported that arafat had died .
" mr. arafat passed away a quarter of an hour ago , " juncker told reporters in brussels at 1640 gmt .
his aides later retracted the statement .
french president jacques chirac , who made an half-hour visit to the percy military training hospital where arafat had been admitted before going to brussels for an meeting with juncker and other eu leaders , refused to answer journalists ' questions as to whether arafat was dead .
palestinian officials in paris and the west bank spent the day denying the reports of arafat 's demise , but said their leader was in " critical condition " in the hospital 's intensive care unit .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qorei told reporters at his west bank headquarters in ramallah that arafat " is not in a coma . "
" there have been examinations and results are positive , " he said without elaborating .
" it is wrong .
if the president was dead , the whole world would know , " palestinian communications minister azzam al-ahmed told afp .
" but it is true that he is a very critical condition , " he added .
no diagnosis french medical sources said arafat 's health had suddenly and dramatically deteriorated wednesday while he was undergoing tests to determine the cause of an illness which prompted his medical evacuation to paris last friday .
a diagnosis of the illness has not been revealed .
palestinian officials said weekend tests had ruled out leukaemia or other cancers that might have explained the symptoms suffered by arafat , who had low levels of blood platelets needed for blood clotting .
in washington , newly re-elected us president george w. bush said " god bless his soul " when told by a reporter of the unconfirmed reports that the palestinian leader had died .
a us state department official later said : " the latest we have from the french is that he is in a criticial but semi-conscious state . "
no brain activity a french medical source said an electroencephalogram -lrb- eeg -rrb- , a type of brain scan , was carried out on arafat thursday - itself " a sign of extreme gravity " - and that there was no reading of any cerebral activity .
france has long supported arafat in his 40-year struggle for palestinian statehood , and chirac was said to have made the decision personally to provide hospital treatment for him .
arafat was said to have been well enough wednesday to welcome bush 's re-election and , according to one of his aides , said he hoped for a jumpstart to the moribund middle east peace process .
arafat 's departure from his battered west bank headquarters have sparked intense speculation about his eventual successor , but officials insist there is no power vacuum .
in arafat 's absence , qorei has taken over as acting head of the palestinian authority , while former premier mahmud abbas is temporarily heading the plo and arafat 's dominant fatah faction . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?

but chocoholics can take comfort from the good news that their guilty pleasure also has some health benefits . we 're all familiar with the theory that eating chocolate triggers the release of endorphins , natural opiates in the brain that reduce pain .
but the feel-good factor aside , hamburg-based dak health insurance firm says eating chocolate actually cuts the risk of heart attacks .
dak based the claim on a scientific study conducted by greek heart experts and presented at a recent convention in munich hosted by the association of european cardiologists .
apparently , the flavanol in cocoa reduces what 's known as cellular " oxidative stress , " which can contribute to circulatory disorders . over the years , scientists have begun to accept that the antioxidants found in cocoa can decrease the risk of coronary artery disease .
flavanols have a beneficial influence on vascular health , and cardiovascular diseases remain the number one killer in developed countries .
you know you want to but never before has an insurance firm actually advised clients to indulge their sugar cravings .
dak says that the evidence is now strong enough that they have decided to encourage clients to eat more plain chocolate .

wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .
stuttgart , who looked like championship thoroughbreds in a field of stumbling ponies just three weeks ago , have long since waved goodbye to their unbeaten record and are on a losing streak themselves . second placed schlake keep the heat on stuttgart fell victim to schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick 's resurgent title contenders in a scorcher of a match in gelsenkirchen , losing 3-2 to the royal blues .
brazilian ailton scored after just forty seconds to register his third goal in as many matches as schalke 04 recorded their fifth straight league win .
after going the first eight games unbeaten stuttgart have now lost three in a row . schalke travel to hamburg on sunday to face an hsv side on a slow rise out of the drop zone .
hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .
the southerners travel to leverkusen to face a potentially fired up bayer team out for revenge after losing to dortmund last weekend . however , the 1-1 draw which put as roma out of the champions league in midweek and helped their own chances of qualification could help leverkusen regain the more positive side of their spluttering form . borussia dortmund notched their first home win of the season over leverkusen in the 1-0 defeat , thanks to brazilian ewerthon who scored the only goal after 41 minutes .
the victory was a respite from the freefall the heavily in-debt have been suffering of late and it helped bvb hang on to 11th spot .
the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .
substitute selim teber cancelled out delron buckley 's 79th minute opener and struck a late winner to move kaiserslautern off the bottom spot and to give their under-fire boss some breathing space . kaiserslautern have the opportunity to get further out of trouble at the expense of a side in danger of going further in the opposite direction .
bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .
the 3-0 win at home to bochum continued their current renaissance and lifted them up to within four points of the summit .
it is conceivable , given their opponents loss of form of late , that hanover could keep the unexpected pressure on with another victory in week twelve . spluttering bavarian giants risk disaster bayern suffered a major setback when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
bayern 's third defeat of the campaign means they slipped to fifth , four points adrift of leaders wolfsburg .
on top of that , a 1-0 loss at home to juventus in the champions league left bayern 's european ambitions on a knife edge . munich will be without brazilian world cup winner lucio on saturday after he was dismissed in the second half of last week 's league game for stomping on czech opponent vaclav sverkos , capping a miserable afternoon for felix magath 's bavarian outfit . playing bayern in your first match in charge is not ideal but interim borussia mönchengladbach chief horst koppel , who stepped in to replace holger fach when he was sacked on wednesday , kept a cool head - and goals from marcelo pletsch and joris van hout made his job easier .
his next match in charge will be away at fsv mainz . plucky mainz off the pace mainz have seen their own season hit a lull after pushing for the top spots for the first two months .
back-to-back defeats have seen the reds slip to seventh and the spirited but ultimately futile tussle with the wolves last week . the 4-3 defeat may have dented their chances of claiming an improbable first bundesliga title but it at least showed they have the scoring ability , something they will want to exploit against ' gladbach on saturday if they 're not to slip further out of contention . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern embarrassed , wolfsburg wins goalfest bayern munich suffered a major setback ahead of wednesday 's champions league clash with juventus when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .

the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .
substitute selim teber cancelled out delron buckley 's 79th minute opener and struck a late winner to move kaiserslautern off the bottom spot and to give their under-fire boss some breathing space . kaiserslautern have the opportunity to get further out of trouble at the expense of a side in danger of going further in the opposite direction .
bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .
the 3-0 win at home to bochum continued their current renaissance and lifted them up to within four points of the summit .
it is conceivable , given their opponents loss of form of late , that hanover could keep the unexpected pressure on with another victory in week twelve . spluttering bavarian giants risk disaster bayern suffered a major setback when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
bayern 's third defeat of the campaign means they slipped to fifth , four points adrift of leaders wolfsburg .
on top of that , a 1-0 loss at home to juventus in the champions league left bayern 's european ambitions on a knife edge . munich will be without brazilian world cup winner lucio on saturday after he was dismissed in the second half of last week 's league game for stomping on czech opponent vaclav sverkos , capping a miserable afternoon for felix magath 's bavarian outfit . playing bayern in your first match in charge is not ideal but interim borussia mönchengladbach chief horst koppel , who stepped in to replace holger fach when he was sacked on wednesday , kept a cool head - and goals from marcelo pletsch and joris van hout made his job easier .
his next match in charge will be away at fsv mainz . plucky mainz off the pace mainz have seen their own season hit a lull after pushing for the top spots for the first two months .
back-to-back defeats have seen the reds slip to seventh and the spirited but ultimately futile tussle with the wolves last week . the 4-3 defeat may have dented their chances of claiming an improbable first bundesliga title but it at least showed they have the scoring ability , something they will want to exploit against ' gladbach on saturday if they 're not to slip further out of contention . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern embarrassed , wolfsburg wins goalfest bayern munich suffered a major setback ahead of wednesday 's champions league clash with juventus when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe europe -pipe- 04.11.2004 opinion : the world 's bush dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he be as divisive during his second term ?
americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .
up to now , the german farms were shut down as a precaution , since traces of the known carcinogen have yet to be proven .
testing , however , is being carried out .

potato skins are source in the netherlands a few weeks ago , dioxin was found in cow milk and traced to potato-skin feed that came from canadian french-fry maker mccain .
all of the nearly 150 shut down farms fed their livestock potato skins that had been treated with a specific kind of clay used in sorting the spuds , a spokeswoman for the dutch agriculture ministry said wednesday .
the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .

the information followed a short statement by a senior french military official who said " mr arafat is not dead . "
the palestinian authority president 's condition was " complex , " general christian estripeau , the spokesman for the french defence forces ' medical service , told reporters outside the paris military hospital which had been tending to arafat .
" the patient 's condition needs appropriate treatment which required his being transferred to a unit suited to his pathology on the afternoon of wednesday november 3 , " he said .
he refused to take questions , but said his statement had been prepared according to the wishes of arafat 's wife , suha .
earlier thursday , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and israeli media had reported that arafat had died .
" mr. arafat passed away a quarter of an hour ago , " juncker told reporters in brussels at 1640 gmt .
his aides later retracted the statement .
french president jacques chirac , who made an half-hour visit to the percy military training hospital where arafat had been admitted before going to brussels for an meeting with juncker and other eu leaders , refused to answer journalists ' questions as to whether arafat was dead .
palestinian officials in paris and the west bank spent the day denying the reports of arafat 's demise , but said their leader was in " critical condition " in the hospital 's intensive care unit .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qorei told reporters at his west bank headquarters in ramallah that arafat " is not in a coma . "
" there have been examinations and results are positive , " he said without elaborating .
" it is wrong .
if the president was dead , the whole world would know , " palestinian communications minister azzam al-ahmed told afp .
" but it is true that he is a very critical condition , " he added .
no diagnosis french medical sources said arafat 's health had suddenly and dramatically deteriorated wednesday while he was undergoing tests to determine the cause of an illness which prompted his medical evacuation to paris last friday .
a diagnosis of the illness has not been revealed .
palestinian officials said weekend tests had ruled out leukaemia or other cancers that might have explained the symptoms suffered by arafat , who had low levels of blood platelets needed for blood clotting .
in washington , newly re-elected us president george w. bush said " god bless his soul " when told by a reporter of the unconfirmed reports that the palestinian leader had died .
a us state department official later said : " the latest we have from the french is that he is in a criticial but semi-conscious state . "
no brain activity a french medical source said an electroencephalogram -lrb- eeg -rrb- , a type of brain scan , was carried out on arafat thursday - itself " a sign of extreme gravity " - and that there was no reading of any cerebral activity .
france has long supported arafat in his 40-year struggle for palestinian statehood , and chirac was said to have made the decision personally to provide hospital treatment for him .
arafat was said to have been well enough wednesday to welcome bush 's re-election and , according to one of his aides , said he hoped for a jumpstart to the moribund middle east peace process .
arafat 's departure from his battered west bank headquarters have sparked intense speculation about his eventual successor , but officials insist there is no power vacuum .
in arafat 's absence , qorei has taken over as acting head of the palestinian authority , while former premier mahmud abbas is temporarily heading the plo and arafat 's dominant fatah faction . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?
ailing palestinian leader yasser arafat has been flown to paris for medical treatment .
even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .
up to now , the german farms were shut down as a precaution , since traces of the known carcinogen have yet to be proven .
testing , however , is being carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch agriculture authorities named the farms as having received dioxin-contaminated feed from the netherlands , a spokesperson for north rhine-westphalia 's environmental ministry told news agencies in düsseldorf .
the state borders holland and belgium .
potato skins are source in the netherlands a few weeks ago , dioxin was found in cow milk and traced to potato-skin feed that came from canadian french-fry maker mccain .
all of the nearly 150 shut down farms fed their livestock potato skins that had been treated with a specific kind of clay used in sorting the spuds , a spokeswoman for the dutch agriculture ministry said wednesday .
the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .
dioxins are one of a number of toxic chemicals that originate in pesticides or industrial processes , leach into rivers and lakes and build up in the flesh of fish and animals . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study triggers new bse scandal in france france is bracing itself for another bse or " mad cow " disease scandal after two medical researchers published a study suggesting the number of infected animals has been drastically underestimated .

americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .

his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .

" so far we have coordination only with france .

they announced the results of consultations by a commission of lawyers from both countries who had concluded that german post-war claims on poland and polish demands for reparations from germany were " without foundation . "
" the most important factor in the -lrb- commission 's -rrb- expert opinion is that there is no legal basis for claims by one side or the other , " schroeder said .
belka said the claims would not be eligible for consideration by courts either in germany , poland or the united states .
the threats of legal action that were flying back and forth between laywers representing victims ' groups had chilled otherwise warm relations between poland and germany .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.11.2004 germany 's national holiday in jeopardy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from 2005 , germans wo n't get a day off to mark reunification germany looks set to lose one of its public holidays as the government struggles with a growing budget deficit .
the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

the information followed a short statement by a senior french military official who said " mr arafat is not dead . "
the palestinian authority president 's condition was " complex , " general christian estripeau , the spokesman for the french defence forces ' medical service , told reporters outside the paris military hospital which had been tending to arafat .
" the patient 's condition needs appropriate treatment which required his being transferred to a unit suited to his pathology on the afternoon of wednesday november 3 , " he said .
he refused to take questions , but said his statement had been prepared according to the wishes of arafat 's wife , suha .
earlier thursday , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and israeli media had reported that arafat had died .
" mr. arafat passed away a quarter of an hour ago , " juncker told reporters in brussels at 1640 gmt .
his aides later retracted the statement .
french president jacques chirac , who made an half-hour visit to the percy military training hospital where arafat had been admitted before going to brussels for an meeting with juncker and other eu leaders , refused to answer journalists ' questions as to whether arafat was dead .
palestinian officials in paris and the west bank spent the day denying the reports of arafat 's demise , but said their leader was in " critical condition " in the hospital 's intensive care unit .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qorei told reporters at his west bank headquarters in ramallah that arafat " is not in a coma . "
" there have been examinations and results are positive , " he said without elaborating .
" it is wrong .
if the president was dead , the whole world would know , " palestinian communications minister azzam al-ahmed told afp .
" but it is true that he is a very critical condition , " he added .
no diagnosis french medical sources said arafat 's health had suddenly and dramatically deteriorated wednesday while he was undergoing tests to determine the cause of an illness which prompted his medical evacuation to paris last friday .
a diagnosis of the illness has not been revealed .
palestinian officials said weekend tests had ruled out leukaemia or other cancers that might have explained the symptoms suffered by arafat , who had low levels of blood platelets needed for blood clotting .
in washington , newly re-elected us president george w. bush said " god bless his soul " when told by a reporter of the unconfirmed reports that the palestinian leader had died .
a us state department official later said : " the latest we have from the french is that he is in a criticial but semi-conscious state . "
no brain activity a french medical source said an electroencephalogram -lrb- eeg -rrb- , a type of brain scan , was carried out on arafat thursday - itself " a sign of extreme gravity " - and that there was no reading of any cerebral activity .
france has long supported arafat in his 40-year struggle for palestinian statehood , and chirac was said to have made the decision personally to provide hospital treatment for him .
arafat was said to have been well enough wednesday to welcome bush 's re-election and , according to one of his aides , said he hoped for a jumpstart to the moribund middle east peace process .
arafat 's departure from his battered west bank headquarters have sparked intense speculation about his eventual successor , but officials insist there is no power vacuum .

wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .
stuttgart , who looked like championship thoroughbreds in a field of stumbling ponies just three weeks ago , have long since waved goodbye to their unbeaten record and are on a losing streak themselves . second placed schlake keep the heat on stuttgart fell victim to schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick 's resurgent title contenders in a scorcher of a match in gelsenkirchen , losing 3-2 to the royal blues .
brazilian ailton scored after just forty seconds to register his third goal in as many matches as schalke 04 recorded their fifth straight league win .
after going the first eight games unbeaten stuttgart have now lost three in a row . schalke travel to hamburg on sunday to face an hsv side on a slow rise out of the drop zone .
hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .
the southerners travel to leverkusen to face a potentially fired up bayer team out for revenge after losing to dortmund last weekend . however , the 1-1 draw which put as roma out of the champions league in midweek and helped their own chances of qualification could help leverkusen regain the more positive side of their spluttering form . borussia dortmund notched their first home win of the season over leverkusen in the 1-0 defeat , thanks to brazilian ewerthon who scored the only goal after 41 minutes .
the victory was a respite from the freefall the heavily in-debt have been suffering of late and it helped bvb hang on to 11th spot .
the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .
substitute selim teber cancelled out delron buckley 's 79th minute opener and struck a late winner to move kaiserslautern off the bottom spot and to give their under-fire boss some breathing space . kaiserslautern have the opportunity to get further out of trouble at the expense of a side in danger of going further in the opposite direction .
bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .

the information followed a short statement by a senior french military official who said " mr arafat is not dead . "
the palestinian authority president 's condition was " complex , " general christian estripeau , the spokesman for the french defence forces ' medical service , told reporters outside the paris military hospital which had been tending to arafat .
" the patient 's condition needs appropriate treatment which required his being transferred to a unit suited to his pathology on the afternoon of wednesday november 3 , " he said .
he refused to take questions , but said his statement had been prepared according to the wishes of arafat 's wife , suha .
earlier thursday , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and israeli media had reported that arafat had died .
" mr. arafat passed away a quarter of an hour ago , " juncker told reporters in brussels at 1640 gmt .
his aides later retracted the statement .
french president jacques chirac , who made an half-hour visit to the percy military training hospital where arafat had been admitted before going to brussels for an meeting with juncker and other eu leaders , refused to answer journalists ' questions as to whether arafat was dead .
palestinian officials in paris and the west bank spent the day denying the reports of arafat 's demise , but said their leader was in " critical condition " in the hospital 's intensive care unit .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qorei told reporters at his west bank headquarters in ramallah that arafat " is not in a coma . "
" there have been examinations and results are positive , " he said without elaborating .
" it is wrong .
if the president was dead , the whole world would know , " palestinian communications minister azzam al-ahmed told afp .
" but it is true that he is a very critical condition , " he added .
no diagnosis french medical sources said arafat 's health had suddenly and dramatically deteriorated wednesday while he was undergoing tests to determine the cause of an illness which prompted his medical evacuation to paris last friday .
a diagnosis of the illness has not been revealed .
palestinian officials said weekend tests had ruled out leukaemia or other cancers that might have explained the symptoms suffered by arafat , who had low levels of blood platelets needed for blood clotting .
in washington , newly re-elected us president george w. bush said " god bless his soul " when told by a reporter of the unconfirmed reports that the palestinian leader had died .
a us state department official later said : " the latest we have from the french is that he is in a criticial but semi-conscious state . "
no brain activity a french medical source said an electroencephalogram -lrb- eeg -rrb- , a type of brain scan , was carried out on arafat thursday - itself " a sign of extreme gravity " - and that there was no reading of any cerebral activity .
france has long supported arafat in his 40-year struggle for palestinian statehood , and chirac was said to have made the decision personally to provide hospital treatment for him .
arafat was said to have been well enough wednesday to welcome bush 's re-election and , according to one of his aides , said he hoped for a jumpstart to the moribund middle east peace process .
arafat 's departure from his battered west bank headquarters have sparked intense speculation about his eventual successor , but officials insist there is no power vacuum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 04.11.2004 wolves open up lead in championship race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's daylight between wolfsburg and their nearest rivals at the top the close bundesliga title race is beginning to fracture .
wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .
stuttgart , who looked like championship thoroughbreds in a field of stumbling ponies just three weeks ago , have long since waved goodbye to their unbeaten record and are on a losing streak themselves . second placed schlake keep the heat on stuttgart fell victim to schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick 's resurgent title contenders in a scorcher of a match in gelsenkirchen , losing 3-2 to the royal blues .
brazilian ailton scored after just forty seconds to register his third goal in as many matches as schalke 04 recorded their fifth straight league win .
after going the first eight games unbeaten stuttgart have now lost three in a row . schalke travel to hamburg on sunday to face an hsv side on a slow rise out of the drop zone .
hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .
the southerners travel to leverkusen to face a potentially fired up bayer team out for revenge after losing to dortmund last weekend . however , the 1-1 draw which put as roma out of the champions league in midweek and helped their own chances of qualification could help leverkusen regain the more positive side of their spluttering form . borussia dortmund notched their first home win of the season over leverkusen in the 1-0 defeat , thanks to brazilian ewerthon who scored the only goal after 41 minutes .
the victory was a respite from the freefall the heavily in-debt have been suffering of late and it helped bvb hang on to 11th spot .
the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .
substitute selim teber cancelled out delron buckley 's 79th minute opener and struck a late winner to move kaiserslautern off the bottom spot and to give their under-fire boss some breathing space . kaiserslautern have the opportunity to get further out of trouble at the expense of a side in danger of going further in the opposite direction .
bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .
the 3-0 win at home to bochum continued their current renaissance and lifted them up to within four points of the summit .
it is conceivable , given their opponents loss of form of late , that hanover could keep the unexpected pressure on with another victory in week twelve . spluttering bavarian giants risk disaster bayern suffered a major setback when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
bayern 's third defeat of the campaign means they slipped to fifth , four points adrift of leaders wolfsburg .
on top of that , a 1-0 loss at home to juventus in the champions league left bayern 's european ambitions on a knife edge . munich will be without brazilian world cup winner lucio on saturday after he was dismissed in the second half of last week 's league game for stomping on czech opponent vaclav sverkos , capping a miserable afternoon for felix magath 's bavarian outfit . playing bayern in your first match in charge is not ideal but interim borussia mönchengladbach chief horst koppel , who stepped in to replace holger fach when he was sacked on wednesday , kept a cool head - and goals from marcelo pletsch and joris van hout made his job easier .
his next match in charge will be away at fsv mainz . plucky mainz off the pace mainz have seen their own season hit a lull after pushing for the top spots for the first two months .
back-to-back defeats have seen the reds slip to seventh and the spirited but ultimately futile tussle with the wolves last week . the 4-3 defeat may have dented their chances of claiming an improbable first bundesliga title but it at least showed they have the scoring ability , something they will want to exploit against ' gladbach on saturday if they 're not to slip further out of contention . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern embarrassed , wolfsburg wins goalfest bayern munich suffered a major setback ahead of wednesday 's champions league clash with juventus when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .

the information followed a short statement by a senior french military official who said " mr arafat is not dead . "
the palestinian authority president 's condition was " complex , " general christian estripeau , the spokesman for the french defence forces ' medical service , told reporters outside the paris military hospital which had been tending to arafat .
" the patient 's condition needs appropriate treatment which required his being transferred to a unit suited to his pathology on the afternoon of wednesday november 3 , " he said .
he refused to take questions , but said his statement had been prepared according to the wishes of arafat 's wife , suha .
earlier thursday , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and israeli media had reported that arafat had died .
" mr. arafat passed away a quarter of an hour ago , " juncker told reporters in brussels at 1640 gmt .
his aides later retracted the statement .
french president jacques chirac , who made an half-hour visit to the percy military training hospital where arafat had been admitted before going to brussels for an meeting with juncker and other eu leaders , refused to answer journalists ' questions as to whether arafat was dead .
palestinian officials in paris and the west bank spent the day denying the reports of arafat 's demise , but said their leader was in " critical condition " in the hospital 's intensive care unit .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qorei told reporters at his west bank headquarters in ramallah that arafat " is not in a coma . "
" there have been examinations and results are positive , " he said without elaborating .
" it is wrong .
if the president was dead , the whole world would know , " palestinian communications minister azzam al-ahmed told afp .
" but it is true that he is a very critical condition , " he added .
no diagnosis french medical sources said arafat 's health had suddenly and dramatically deteriorated wednesday while he was undergoing tests to determine the cause of an illness which prompted his medical evacuation to paris last friday .
a diagnosis of the illness has not been revealed .
palestinian officials said weekend tests had ruled out leukaemia or other cancers that might have explained the symptoms suffered by arafat , who had low levels of blood platelets needed for blood clotting .
in washington , newly re-elected us president george w. bush said " god bless his soul " when told by a reporter of the unconfirmed reports that the palestinian leader had died .

the information followed a short statement by a senior french military official who said " mr arafat is not dead . "
the palestinian authority president 's condition was " complex , " general christian estripeau , the spokesman for the french defence forces ' medical service , told reporters outside the paris military hospital which had been tending to arafat .
" the patient 's condition needs appropriate treatment which required his being transferred to a unit suited to his pathology on the afternoon of wednesday november 3 , " he said .
he refused to take questions , but said his statement had been prepared according to the wishes of arafat 's wife , suha .
earlier thursday , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and israeli media had reported that arafat had died .
" mr. arafat passed away a quarter of an hour ago , " juncker told reporters in brussels at 1640 gmt .
his aides later retracted the statement .
french president jacques chirac , who made an half-hour visit to the percy military training hospital where arafat had been admitted before going to brussels for an meeting with juncker and other eu leaders , refused to answer journalists ' questions as to whether arafat was dead .
palestinian officials in paris and the west bank spent the day denying the reports of arafat 's demise , but said their leader was in " critical condition " in the hospital 's intensive care unit .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qorei told reporters at his west bank headquarters in ramallah that arafat " is not in a coma . "
" there have been examinations and results are positive , " he said without elaborating .
" it is wrong .
if the president was dead , the whole world would know , " palestinian communications minister azzam al-ahmed told afp .
" but it is true that he is a very critical condition , " he added .
no diagnosis french medical sources said arafat 's health had suddenly and dramatically deteriorated wednesday while he was undergoing tests to determine the cause of an illness which prompted his medical evacuation to paris last friday .
a diagnosis of the illness has not been revealed .
palestinian officials said weekend tests had ruled out leukaemia or other cancers that might have explained the symptoms suffered by arafat , who had low levels of blood platelets needed for blood clotting .
in washington , newly re-elected us president george w. bush said " god bless his soul " when told by a reporter of the unconfirmed reports that the palestinian leader had died .
a us state department official later said : " the latest we have from the french is that he is in a criticial but semi-conscious state . "
no brain activity a french medical source said an electroencephalogram -lrb- eeg -rrb- , a type of brain scan , was carried out on arafat thursday - itself " a sign of extreme gravity " - and that there was no reading of any cerebral activity .
france has long supported arafat in his 40-year struggle for palestinian statehood , and chirac was said to have made the decision personally to provide hospital treatment for him .
arafat was said to have been well enough wednesday to welcome bush 's re-election and , according to one of his aides , said he hoped for a jumpstart to the moribund middle east peace process .
arafat 's departure from his battered west bank headquarters have sparked intense speculation about his eventual successor , but officials insist there is no power vacuum .
in arafat 's absence , qorei has taken over as acting head of the palestinian authority , while former premier mahmud abbas is temporarily heading the plo and arafat 's dominant fatah faction . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?
ailing palestinian leader yasser arafat has been flown to paris for medical treatment .
even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician .
-lrb- oct.29 , 2004 -rrb- eu : funds not used for palestinian terror following a preliminary investigation , the european union said tuesday it had found no evidence that donations to the palestinian authority had been misused to fund terrorist activities .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .
up to now , the german farms were shut down as a precaution , since traces of the known carcinogen have yet to be proven .
testing , however , is being carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch agriculture authorities named the farms as having received dioxin-contaminated feed from the netherlands , a spokesperson for north rhine-westphalia 's environmental ministry told news agencies in düsseldorf .
the state borders holland and belgium .
potato skins are source in the netherlands a few weeks ago , dioxin was found in cow milk and traced to potato-skin feed that came from canadian french-fry maker mccain .
all of the nearly 150 shut down farms fed their livestock potato skins that had been treated with a specific kind of clay used in sorting the spuds , a spokeswoman for the dutch agriculture ministry said wednesday .
the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .
dioxins are one of a number of toxic chemicals that originate in pesticides or industrial processes , leach into rivers and lakes and build up in the flesh of fish and animals . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study triggers new bse scandal in france france is bracing itself for another bse or " mad cow " disease scandal after two medical researchers published a study suggesting the number of infected animals has been drastically underestimated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe europe -pipe- 04.11.2004 opinion : the world 's bush dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he be as divisive during his second term ?
americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

the information followed a short statement by a senior french military official who said " mr arafat is not dead . "
the palestinian authority president 's condition was " complex , " general christian estripeau , the spokesman for the french defence forces ' medical service , told reporters outside the paris military hospital which had been tending to arafat .
" the patient 's condition needs appropriate treatment which required his being transferred to a unit suited to his pathology on the afternoon of wednesday november 3 , " he said .
he refused to take questions , but said his statement had been prepared according to the wishes of arafat 's wife , suha .
earlier thursday , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and israeli media had reported that arafat had died .
" mr. arafat passed away a quarter of an hour ago , " juncker told reporters in brussels at 1640 gmt .
his aides later retracted the statement .
french president jacques chirac , who made an half-hour visit to the percy military training hospital where arafat had been admitted before going to brussels for an meeting with juncker and other eu leaders , refused to answer journalists ' questions as to whether arafat was dead .
palestinian officials in paris and the west bank spent the day denying the reports of arafat 's demise , but said their leader was in " critical condition " in the hospital 's intensive care unit .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qorei told reporters at his west bank headquarters in ramallah that arafat " is not in a coma . "
" there have been examinations and results are positive , " he said without elaborating .
" it is wrong .
if the president was dead , the whole world would know , " palestinian communications minister azzam al-ahmed told afp .
" but it is true that he is a very critical condition , " he added .
no diagnosis french medical sources said arafat 's health had suddenly and dramatically deteriorated wednesday while he was undergoing tests to determine the cause of an illness which prompted his medical evacuation to paris last friday .
a diagnosis of the illness has not been revealed .
palestinian officials said weekend tests had ruled out leukaemia or other cancers that might have explained the symptoms suffered by arafat , who had low levels of blood platelets needed for blood clotting .
in washington , newly re-elected us president george w. bush said " god bless his soul " when told by a reporter of the unconfirmed reports that the palestinian leader had died .
a us state department official later said : " the latest we have from the french is that he is in a criticial but semi-conscious state . "
no brain activity a french medical source said an electroencephalogram -lrb- eeg -rrb- , a type of brain scan , was carried out on arafat thursday - itself " a sign of extreme gravity " - and that there was no reading of any cerebral activity .
france has long supported arafat in his 40-year struggle for palestinian statehood , and chirac was said to have made the decision personally to provide hospital treatment for him .
arafat was said to have been well enough wednesday to welcome bush 's re-election and , according to one of his aides , said he hoped for a jumpstart to the moribund middle east peace process .
arafat 's departure from his battered west bank headquarters have sparked intense speculation about his eventual successor , but officials insist there is no power vacuum .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .

potato skins are source in the netherlands a few weeks ago , dioxin was found in cow milk and traced to potato-skin feed that came from canadian french-fry maker mccain .
all of the nearly 150 shut down farms fed their livestock potato skins that had been treated with a specific kind of clay used in sorting the spuds , a spokeswoman for the dutch agriculture ministry said wednesday .
the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 04.11.2004 wolves open up lead in championship race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's daylight between wolfsburg and their nearest rivals at the top the close bundesliga title race is beginning to fracture .
wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .
stuttgart , who looked like championship thoroughbreds in a field of stumbling ponies just three weeks ago , have long since waved goodbye to their unbeaten record and are on a losing streak themselves . second placed schlake keep the heat on stuttgart fell victim to schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick 's resurgent title contenders in a scorcher of a match in gelsenkirchen , losing 3-2 to the royal blues .
brazilian ailton scored after just forty seconds to register his third goal in as many matches as schalke 04 recorded their fifth straight league win .
after going the first eight games unbeaten stuttgart have now lost three in a row . schalke travel to hamburg on sunday to face an hsv side on a slow rise out of the drop zone .
hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .
the southerners travel to leverkusen to face a potentially fired up bayer team out for revenge after losing to dortmund last weekend . however , the 1-1 draw which put as roma out of the champions league in midweek and helped their own chances of qualification could help leverkusen regain the more positive side of their spluttering form . borussia dortmund notched their first home win of the season over leverkusen in the 1-0 defeat , thanks to brazilian ewerthon who scored the only goal after 41 minutes .
the victory was a respite from the freefall the heavily in-debt have been suffering of late and it helped bvb hang on to 11th spot .
the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .
substitute selim teber cancelled out delron buckley 's 79th minute opener and struck a late winner to move kaiserslautern off the bottom spot and to give their under-fire boss some breathing space . kaiserslautern have the opportunity to get further out of trouble at the expense of a side in danger of going further in the opposite direction .
bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .
the 3-0 win at home to bochum continued their current renaissance and lifted them up to within four points of the summit .
it is conceivable , given their opponents loss of form of late , that hanover could keep the unexpected pressure on with another victory in week twelve . spluttering bavarian giants risk disaster bayern suffered a major setback when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
bayern 's third defeat of the campaign means they slipped to fifth , four points adrift of leaders wolfsburg .
on top of that , a 1-0 loss at home to juventus in the champions league left bayern 's european ambitions on a knife edge . munich will be without brazilian world cup winner lucio on saturday after he was dismissed in the second half of last week 's league game for stomping on czech opponent vaclav sverkos , capping a miserable afternoon for felix magath 's bavarian outfit . playing bayern in your first match in charge is not ideal but interim borussia mönchengladbach chief horst koppel , who stepped in to replace holger fach when he was sacked on wednesday , kept a cool head - and goals from marcelo pletsch and joris van hout made his job easier .
his next match in charge will be away at fsv mainz . plucky mainz off the pace mainz have seen their own season hit a lull after pushing for the top spots for the first two months .
back-to-back defeats have seen the reds slip to seventh and the spirited but ultimately futile tussle with the wolves last week . the 4-3 defeat may have dented their chances of claiming an improbable first bundesliga title but it at least showed they have the scoring ability , something they will want to exploit against ' gladbach on saturday if they 're not to slip further out of contention . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern embarrassed , wolfsburg wins goalfest bayern munich suffered a major setback ahead of wednesday 's champions league clash with juventus when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .

wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .
stuttgart , who looked like championship thoroughbreds in a field of stumbling ponies just three weeks ago , have long since waved goodbye to their unbeaten record and are on a losing streak themselves . second placed schlake keep the heat on stuttgart fell victim to schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick 's resurgent title contenders in a scorcher of a match in gelsenkirchen , losing 3-2 to the royal blues .
brazilian ailton scored after just forty seconds to register his third goal in as many matches as schalke 04 recorded their fifth straight league win .
after going the first eight games unbeaten stuttgart have now lost three in a row . schalke travel to hamburg on sunday to face an hsv side on a slow rise out of the drop zone .
hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .
the southerners travel to leverkusen to face a potentially fired up bayer team out for revenge after losing to dortmund last weekend . however , the 1-1 draw which put as roma out of the champions league in midweek and helped their own chances of qualification could help leverkusen regain the more positive side of their spluttering form . borussia dortmund notched their first home win of the season over leverkusen in the 1-0 defeat , thanks to brazilian ewerthon who scored the only goal after 41 minutes .
the victory was a respite from the freefall the heavily in-debt have been suffering of late and it helped bvb hang on to 11th spot .
the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .
substitute selim teber cancelled out delron buckley 's 79th minute opener and struck a late winner to move kaiserslautern off the bottom spot and to give their under-fire boss some breathing space . kaiserslautern have the opportunity to get further out of trouble at the expense of a side in danger of going further in the opposite direction .
bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .
the 3-0 win at home to bochum continued their current renaissance and lifted them up to within four points of the summit .
it is conceivable , given their opponents loss of form of late , that hanover could keep the unexpected pressure on with another victory in week twelve . spluttering bavarian giants risk disaster bayern suffered a major setback when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
bayern 's third defeat of the campaign means they slipped to fifth , four points adrift of leaders wolfsburg .
on top of that , a 1-0 loss at home to juventus in the champions league left bayern 's european ambitions on a knife edge . munich will be without brazilian world cup winner lucio on saturday after he was dismissed in the second half of last week 's league game for stomping on czech opponent vaclav sverkos , capping a miserable afternoon for felix magath 's bavarian outfit . playing bayern in your first match in charge is not ideal but interim borussia mönchengladbach chief horst koppel , who stepped in to replace holger fach when he was sacked on wednesday , kept a cool head - and goals from marcelo pletsch and joris van hout made his job easier .
his next match in charge will be away at fsv mainz . plucky mainz off the pace mainz have seen their own season hit a lull after pushing for the top spots for the first two months .
back-to-back defeats have seen the reds slip to seventh and the spirited but ultimately futile tussle with the wolves last week . the 4-3 defeat may have dented their chances of claiming an improbable first bundesliga title but it at least showed they have the scoring ability , something they will want to exploit against ' gladbach on saturday if they 're not to slip further out of contention . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern embarrassed , wolfsburg wins goalfest bayern munich suffered a major setback ahead of wednesday 's champions league clash with juventus when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .
up to now , the german farms were shut down as a precaution , since traces of the known carcinogen have yet to be proven .
testing , however , is being carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch agriculture authorities named the farms as having received dioxin-contaminated feed from the netherlands , a spokesperson for north rhine-westphalia 's environmental ministry told news agencies in düsseldorf .
the state borders holland and belgium .
potato skins are source in the netherlands a few weeks ago , dioxin was found in cow milk and traced to potato-skin feed that came from canadian french-fry maker mccain .
all of the nearly 150 shut down farms fed their livestock potato skins that had been treated with a specific kind of clay used in sorting the spuds , a spokeswoman for the dutch agriculture ministry said wednesday .
the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

but chocoholics can take comfort from the good news that their guilty pleasure also has some health benefits . we 're all familiar with the theory that eating chocolate triggers the release of endorphins , natural opiates in the brain that reduce pain .
but the feel-good factor aside , hamburg-based dak health insurance firm says eating chocolate actually cuts the risk of heart attacks .
dak based the claim on a scientific study conducted by greek heart experts and presented at a recent convention in munich hosted by the association of european cardiologists .
apparently , the flavanol in cocoa reduces what 's known as cellular " oxidative stress , " which can contribute to circulatory disorders . over the years , scientists have begun to accept that the antioxidants found in cocoa can decrease the risk of coronary artery disease .
flavanols have a beneficial influence on vascular health , and cardiovascular diseases remain the number one killer in developed countries .
you know you want to but never before has an insurance firm actually advised clients to indulge their sugar cravings .
dak says that the evidence is now strong enough that they have decided to encourage clients to eat more plain chocolate .
hold on to your candy bars : chocolate is actually part of a well-balanced diet .
now they tell us .
however , this is n't a license to binge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 04.11.2004 wolves open up lead in championship race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's daylight between wolfsburg and their nearest rivals at the top the close bundesliga title race is beginning to fracture .
wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .
stuttgart , who looked like championship thoroughbreds in a field of stumbling ponies just three weeks ago , have long since waved goodbye to their unbeaten record and are on a losing streak themselves . second placed schlake keep the heat on stuttgart fell victim to schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick 's resurgent title contenders in a scorcher of a match in gelsenkirchen , losing 3-2 to the royal blues .
brazilian ailton scored after just forty seconds to register his third goal in as many matches as schalke 04 recorded their fifth straight league win .
after going the first eight games unbeaten stuttgart have now lost three in a row . schalke travel to hamburg on sunday to face an hsv side on a slow rise out of the drop zone .
hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .
the southerners travel to leverkusen to face a potentially fired up bayer team out for revenge after losing to dortmund last weekend . however , the 1-1 draw which put as roma out of the champions league in midweek and helped their own chances of qualification could help leverkusen regain the more positive side of their spluttering form . borussia dortmund notched their first home win of the season over leverkusen in the 1-0 defeat , thanks to brazilian ewerthon who scored the only goal after 41 minutes .
the victory was a respite from the freefall the heavily in-debt have been suffering of late and it helped bvb hang on to 11th spot .
the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .
substitute selim teber cancelled out delron buckley 's 79th minute opener and struck a late winner to move kaiserslautern off the bottom spot and to give their under-fire boss some breathing space . kaiserslautern have the opportunity to get further out of trouble at the expense of a side in danger of going further in the opposite direction .
bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .
the 3-0 win at home to bochum continued their current renaissance and lifted them up to within four points of the summit .
it is conceivable , given their opponents loss of form of late , that hanover could keep the unexpected pressure on with another victory in week twelve . spluttering bavarian giants risk disaster bayern suffered a major setback when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
bayern 's third defeat of the campaign means they slipped to fifth , four points adrift of leaders wolfsburg .
on top of that , a 1-0 loss at home to juventus in the champions league left bayern 's european ambitions on a knife edge . munich will be without brazilian world cup winner lucio on saturday after he was dismissed in the second half of last week 's league game for stomping on czech opponent vaclav sverkos , capping a miserable afternoon for felix magath 's bavarian outfit . playing bayern in your first match in charge is not ideal but interim borussia mönchengladbach chief horst koppel , who stepped in to replace holger fach when he was sacked on wednesday , kept a cool head - and goals from marcelo pletsch and joris van hout made his job easier .
his next match in charge will be away at fsv mainz . plucky mainz off the pace mainz have seen their own season hit a lull after pushing for the top spots for the first two months .
back-to-back defeats have seen the reds slip to seventh and the spirited but ultimately futile tussle with the wolves last week . the 4-3 defeat may have dented their chances of claiming an improbable first bundesliga title but it at least showed they have the scoring ability , something they will want to exploit against ' gladbach on saturday if they 're not to slip further out of contention . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern embarrassed , wolfsburg wins goalfest bayern munich suffered a major setback ahead of wednesday 's champions league clash with juventus when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.11.2004 germany 's national holiday in jeopardy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from 2005 , germans wo n't get a day off to mark reunification germany looks set to lose one of its public holidays as the government struggles with a growing budget deficit .
the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

-lrb- sept .
30 , 2004 -rrb- no new savings measures , eichel promises german finance minister hans eichel said he has no plans to introduce additional savings measures in the wake of a ruling by the european court of justice on germany 's inflated budget deficit . -lrb- july 14 , 2004 -rrb- germany to sell last ' family silver ' the german cabinet on wednesday approved the 2005 budget : it includes plans to sell the country 's last major stakes in former state-owned companies , a move that has been criticized as short-sighted . -lrb- june 24 , 2004 -rrb- feedback is germany right to abolish its national holiday ?

americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

but chocoholics can take comfort from the good news that their guilty pleasure also has some health benefits . we 're all familiar with the theory that eating chocolate triggers the release of endorphins , natural opiates in the brain that reduce pain .
but the feel-good factor aside , hamburg-based dak health insurance firm says eating chocolate actually cuts the risk of heart attacks .
dak based the claim on a scientific study conducted by greek heart experts and presented at a recent convention in munich hosted by the association of european cardiologists .
apparently , the flavanol in cocoa reduces what 's known as cellular " oxidative stress , " which can contribute to circulatory disorders . over the years , scientists have begun to accept that the antioxidants found in cocoa can decrease the risk of coronary artery disease .
flavanols have a beneficial influence on vascular health , and cardiovascular diseases remain the number one killer in developed countries .
you know you want to but never before has an insurance firm actually advised clients to indulge their sugar cravings .
dak says that the evidence is now strong enough that they have decided to encourage clients to eat more plain chocolate .
hold on to your candy bars : chocolate is actually part of a well-balanced diet .
now they tell us .
however , this is n't a license to binge .

americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .
up to now , the german farms were shut down as a precaution , since traces of the known carcinogen have yet to be proven .

potato skins are source in the netherlands a few weeks ago , dioxin was found in cow milk and traced to potato-skin feed that came from canadian french-fry maker mccain .
all of the nearly 150 shut down farms fed their livestock potato skins that had been treated with a specific kind of clay used in sorting the spuds , a spokeswoman for the dutch agriculture ministry said wednesday .
the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .

wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .
stuttgart , who looked like championship thoroughbreds in a field of stumbling ponies just three weeks ago , have long since waved goodbye to their unbeaten record and are on a losing streak themselves . second placed schlake keep the heat on stuttgart fell victim to schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick 's resurgent title contenders in a scorcher of a match in gelsenkirchen , losing 3-2 to the royal blues .
brazilian ailton scored after just forty seconds to register his third goal in as many matches as schalke 04 recorded their fifth straight league win .
after going the first eight games unbeaten stuttgart have now lost three in a row . schalke travel to hamburg on sunday to face an hsv side on a slow rise out of the drop zone .
hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .
the southerners travel to leverkusen to face a potentially fired up bayer team out for revenge after losing to dortmund last weekend . however , the 1-1 draw which put as roma out of the champions league in midweek and helped their own chances of qualification could help leverkusen regain the more positive side of their spluttering form . borussia dortmund notched their first home win of the season over leverkusen in the 1-0 defeat , thanks to brazilian ewerthon who scored the only goal after 41 minutes .
the victory was a respite from the freefall the heavily in-debt have been suffering of late and it helped bvb hang on to 11th spot .
the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .

bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .
the 3-0 win at home to bochum continued their current renaissance and lifted them up to within four points of the summit .
it is conceivable , given their opponents loss of form of late , that hanover could keep the unexpected pressure on with another victory in week twelve . spluttering bavarian giants risk disaster bayern suffered a major setback when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
bayern 's third defeat of the campaign means they slipped to fifth , four points adrift of leaders wolfsburg .
on top of that , a 1-0 loss at home to juventus in the champions league left bayern 's european ambitions on a knife edge . munich will be without brazilian world cup winner lucio on saturday after he was dismissed in the second half of last week 's league game for stomping on czech opponent vaclav sverkos , capping a miserable afternoon for felix magath 's bavarian outfit . playing bayern in your first match in charge is not ideal but interim borussia mönchengladbach chief horst koppel , who stepped in to replace holger fach when he was sacked on wednesday , kept a cool head - and goals from marcelo pletsch and joris van hout made his job easier .
his next match in charge will be away at fsv mainz . plucky mainz off the pace mainz have seen their own season hit a lull after pushing for the top spots for the first two months .
back-to-back defeats have seen the reds slip to seventh and the spirited but ultimately futile tussle with the wolves last week . the 4-3 defeat may have dented their chances of claiming an improbable first bundesliga title but it at least showed they have the scoring ability , something they will want to exploit against ' gladbach on saturday if they 're not to slip further out of contention . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern embarrassed , wolfsburg wins goalfest bayern munich suffered a major setback ahead of wednesday 's champions league clash with juventus when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .

wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .
stuttgart , who looked like championship thoroughbreds in a field of stumbling ponies just three weeks ago , have long since waved goodbye to their unbeaten record and are on a losing streak themselves . second placed schlake keep the heat on stuttgart fell victim to schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick 's resurgent title contenders in a scorcher of a match in gelsenkirchen , losing 3-2 to the royal blues .
brazilian ailton scored after just forty seconds to register his third goal in as many matches as schalke 04 recorded their fifth straight league win .
after going the first eight games unbeaten stuttgart have now lost three in a row . schalke travel to hamburg on sunday to face an hsv side on a slow rise out of the drop zone .
hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .
the southerners travel to leverkusen to face a potentially fired up bayer team out for revenge after losing to dortmund last weekend . however , the 1-1 draw which put as roma out of the champions league in midweek and helped their own chances of qualification could help leverkusen regain the more positive side of their spluttering form . borussia dortmund notched their first home win of the season over leverkusen in the 1-0 defeat , thanks to brazilian ewerthon who scored the only goal after 41 minutes .
the victory was a respite from the freefall the heavily in-debt have been suffering of late and it helped bvb hang on to 11th spot .
the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .
substitute selim teber cancelled out delron buckley 's 79th minute opener and struck a late winner to move kaiserslautern off the bottom spot and to give their under-fire boss some breathing space . kaiserslautern have the opportunity to get further out of trouble at the expense of a side in danger of going further in the opposite direction .
bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .
up to now , the german farms were shut down as a precaution , since traces of the known carcinogen have yet to be proven .
testing , however , is being carried out .

potato skins are source in the netherlands a few weeks ago , dioxin was found in cow milk and traced to potato-skin feed that came from canadian french-fry maker mccain .
all of the nearly 150 shut down farms fed their livestock potato skins that had been treated with a specific kind of clay used in sorting the spuds , a spokeswoman for the dutch agriculture ministry said wednesday .
the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .
up to now , the german farms were shut down as a precaution , since traces of the known carcinogen have yet to be proven .
testing , however , is being carried out .

the state borders holland and belgium .
potato skins are source in the netherlands a few weeks ago , dioxin was found in cow milk and traced to potato-skin feed that came from canadian french-fry maker mccain .
all of the nearly 150 shut down farms fed their livestock potato skins that had been treated with a specific kind of clay used in sorting the spuds , a spokeswoman for the dutch agriculture ministry said wednesday .
the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

but chocoholics can take comfort from the good news that their guilty pleasure also has some health benefits . we 're all familiar with the theory that eating chocolate triggers the release of endorphins , natural opiates in the brain that reduce pain .
but the feel-good factor aside , hamburg-based dak health insurance firm says eating chocolate actually cuts the risk of heart attacks .
dak based the claim on a scientific study conducted by greek heart experts and presented at a recent convention in munich hosted by the association of european cardiologists .
apparently , the flavanol in cocoa reduces what 's known as cellular " oxidative stress , " which can contribute to circulatory disorders . over the years , scientists have begun to accept that the antioxidants found in cocoa can decrease the risk of coronary artery disease .
flavanols have a beneficial influence on vascular health , and cardiovascular diseases remain the number one killer in developed countries .
you know you want to but never before has an insurance firm actually advised clients to indulge their sugar cravings .
dak says that the evidence is now strong enough that they have decided to encourage clients to eat more plain chocolate .
hold on to your candy bars : chocolate is actually part of a well-balanced diet .
now they tell us .
however , this is n't a license to binge .

americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .
up to now , the german farms were shut down as a precaution , since traces of the known carcinogen have yet to be proven .
testing , however , is being carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch agriculture authorities named the farms as having received dioxin-contaminated feed from the netherlands , a spokesperson for north rhine-westphalia 's environmental ministry told news agencies in düsseldorf .
the state borders holland and belgium .
potato skins are source in the netherlands a few weeks ago , dioxin was found in cow milk and traced to potato-skin feed that came from canadian french-fry maker mccain .
all of the nearly 150 shut down farms fed their livestock potato skins that had been treated with a specific kind of clay used in sorting the spuds , a spokeswoman for the dutch agriculture ministry said wednesday .
the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .
dioxins are one of a number of toxic chemicals that originate in pesticides or industrial processes , leach into rivers and lakes and build up in the flesh of fish and animals . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study triggers new bse scandal in france france is bracing itself for another bse or " mad cow " disease scandal after two medical researchers published a study suggesting the number of infected animals has been drastically underestimated .

but chocoholics can take comfort from the good news that their guilty pleasure also has some health benefits . we 're all familiar with the theory that eating chocolate triggers the release of endorphins , natural opiates in the brain that reduce pain .
but the feel-good factor aside , hamburg-based dak health insurance firm says eating chocolate actually cuts the risk of heart attacks .
dak based the claim on a scientific study conducted by greek heart experts and presented at a recent convention in munich hosted by the association of european cardiologists .
apparently , the flavanol in cocoa reduces what 's known as cellular " oxidative stress , " which can contribute to circulatory disorders . over the years , scientists have begun to accept that the antioxidants found in cocoa can decrease the risk of coronary artery disease .
flavanols have a beneficial influence on vascular health , and cardiovascular diseases remain the number one killer in developed countries .
you know you want to but never before has an insurance firm actually advised clients to indulge their sugar cravings .
dak says that the evidence is now strong enough that they have decided to encourage clients to eat more plain chocolate .
hold on to your candy bars : chocolate is actually part of a well-balanced diet .
now they tell us .
however , this is n't a license to binge .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .

potato skins are source in the netherlands a few weeks ago , dioxin was found in cow milk and traced to potato-skin feed that came from canadian french-fry maker mccain .
all of the nearly 150 shut down farms fed their livestock potato skins that had been treated with a specific kind of clay used in sorting the spuds , a spokeswoman for the dutch agriculture ministry said wednesday .
the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .

inside that pink stuff is something a little bit like a computer .
it has " wires " which transmit electricity , and create logical patterns -lrb- you might wonder whether your little sister has logical patterns in her head , but actually , compared to something without a brain like , for example , a pile of mud , even your little sister is logical -rrb- .
but these " wires " do n't look like the wires on telephone poles .

americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .
up to now , the german farms were shut down as a precaution , since traces of the known carcinogen have yet to be proven .
testing , however , is being carried out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch agriculture authorities named the farms as having received dioxin-contaminated feed from the netherlands , a spokesperson for north rhine-westphalia 's environmental ministry told news agencies in düsseldorf .
the state borders holland and belgium .
potato skins are source in the netherlands a few weeks ago , dioxin was found in cow milk and traced to potato-skin feed that came from canadian french-fry maker mccain .
all of the nearly 150 shut down farms fed their livestock potato skins that had been treated with a specific kind of clay used in sorting the spuds , a spokeswoman for the dutch agriculture ministry said wednesday .
the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

the information followed a short statement by a senior french military official who said " mr arafat is not dead . "
the palestinian authority president 's condition was " complex , " general christian estripeau , the spokesman for the french defence forces ' medical service , told reporters outside the paris military hospital which had been tending to arafat .
" the patient 's condition needs appropriate treatment which required his being transferred to a unit suited to his pathology on the afternoon of wednesday november 3 , " he said .
he refused to take questions , but said his statement had been prepared according to the wishes of arafat 's wife , suha .
earlier thursday , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and israeli media had reported that arafat had died .
" mr. arafat passed away a quarter of an hour ago , " juncker told reporters in brussels at 1640 gmt .
his aides later retracted the statement .
french president jacques chirac , who made an half-hour visit to the percy military training hospital where arafat had been admitted before going to brussels for an meeting with juncker and other eu leaders , refused to answer journalists ' questions as to whether arafat was dead .
palestinian officials in paris and the west bank spent the day denying the reports of arafat 's demise , but said their leader was in " critical condition " in the hospital 's intensive care unit .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qorei told reporters at his west bank headquarters in ramallah that arafat " is not in a coma . "
" there have been examinations and results are positive , " he said without elaborating .
" it is wrong .
if the president was dead , the whole world would know , " palestinian communications minister azzam al-ahmed told afp .
" but it is true that he is a very critical condition , " he added .
no diagnosis french medical sources said arafat 's health had suddenly and dramatically deteriorated wednesday while he was undergoing tests to determine the cause of an illness which prompted his medical evacuation to paris last friday .
a diagnosis of the illness has not been revealed .
palestinian officials said weekend tests had ruled out leukaemia or other cancers that might have explained the symptoms suffered by arafat , who had low levels of blood platelets needed for blood clotting .
in washington , newly re-elected us president george w. bush said " god bless his soul " when told by a reporter of the unconfirmed reports that the palestinian leader had died .
a us state department official later said : " the latest we have from the french is that he is in a criticial but semi-conscious state . "
no brain activity a french medical source said an electroencephalogram -lrb- eeg -rrb- , a type of brain scan , was carried out on arafat thursday - itself " a sign of extreme gravity " - and that there was no reading of any cerebral activity .
france has long supported arafat in his 40-year struggle for palestinian statehood , and chirac was said to have made the decision personally to provide hospital treatment for him .
arafat was said to have been well enough wednesday to welcome bush 's re-election and , according to one of his aides , said he hoped for a jumpstart to the moribund middle east peace process .
arafat 's departure from his battered west bank headquarters have sparked intense speculation about his eventual successor , but officials insist there is no power vacuum .
in arafat 's absence , qorei has taken over as acting head of the palestinian authority , while former premier mahmud abbas is temporarily heading the plo and arafat 's dominant fatah faction . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?

wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .

hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .

apparently , the flavanol in cocoa reduces what 's known as cellular " oxidative stress , " which can contribute to circulatory disorders . over the years , scientists have begun to accept that the antioxidants found in cocoa can decrease the risk of coronary artery disease .
flavanols have a beneficial influence on vascular health , and cardiovascular diseases remain the number one killer in developed countries .
you know you want to but never before has an insurance firm actually advised clients to indulge their sugar cravings .
dak says that the evidence is now strong enough that they have decided to encourage clients to eat more plain chocolate .
hold on to your candy bars : chocolate is actually part of a well-balanced diet .
now they tell us .
however , this is n't a license to binge .

the opposition has described the move as " unpatriotic . " finance minister hans eichel is scheduled thursday to present his tax revenue projections and unveil a budget plan which will include the abolition of the " day of german unity , " a public holiday introduced in 1990 to mark the reunification of east and west germany . in future , the anniversary will be celebrated on the first sunday in october rather than october 3 .
the government elected to dispense with this particular holiday on the grounds the move would be less controversial than abolishing a religious holiday . lifting economic growth germans get up to 13 public holidays a year , depending on which state they live in , plus an average of 30 days paid vacation .
several ministers in schröder 's cabinet want the number of public holidays to be reduced .
economics minister wolfgang clement has noted that for this year , at least 0.25 percent of german gdp growth is due to the fact that numerous holidays fall on either saturday or sunday , meaning germans will work a larger than normal number of days in 2004 .
the proposal will now be put to the bundestag , which will then decide whether shifting the public holiday from a working day to a sunday is a viable means of increasing productivity and therefore tax revenue .
abolishing the public holiday will lift economic growth by 0.1 percent . plans to plug deficit revenue experts from germany 's local , regional and national authorities meeting in bremen over the past few days have calculated that the country faces tax revenue shortfalls of € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- for both the current year and 2005 . the news is bad for chancellor gerhard schröder 's government , which still hopes to prevent germany from violating the eu 's growth and stability pact for the fourth year in a row .
the german deficit ratio exceeded the limit of 3.0 percent of gdp in both 2002 and 2003 , and it is set to do so again this year . according to recent media reports , berlin is also considering tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help rein in its budget deficit .
under a deal yet to be approved , the state would pocket windfall gains from the partially privatized companies in exchange for assuming part of their pension liabilities . " one less public holiday is one way of kick-starting significant growth , " said fritz kuhn of the green party , the junior partner in germany 's ruling coalition . a question of patriotism ? free democratic party leader guido westerwelle was less receptive to the idea .
" if we stop celebrating german unity we will soon forget german 's division , " he argued .
" healthy patriotism is not out of date , it has contemporary relevance . "
laurenz meyer , secretary general of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- suggested the proposal showed the government was " desperate , " while markus söder , meyer 's colleague in the christian democrats ' sister party , the csu , observed that the coalition government " lacked sensitivity .

americans have decided george bush is the best man for the helm of the world 's only superpower in these difficult times .
while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .
and the world may not like bush , but it must work with washington to make progress on vital global issues important to all of us . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house read dw-world 's coverage of the us election .

while he may be the pick of us voters , the world , unfortunately , deserves better . in a democracy , it has often been said , the people get the government they deserve .
after a bitter and divisive election , america has handed george bush the popular mandate for the presidency he failed to get four years ago .
to many non-americans , that means us voters have now accepted the man , as well as the consequences of his often extremely polarizing actions . the united states may prefer bush , but it 's no secret most of the world 's population would have rather seen john kerry in the white house .
many around the globe had taken hope from kerry 's promise to move away from bush 's " arrogant " foreign policy .
that hope is , of course , now gone . the botched war in iraq has left america 's reputation in tatters in many parts of the world .
it will be a long road to regain the trust of those who once looked up to the united states .
but sadly , there is little to suggest a second bush term will be more conciliatory than the first . there is a clear danger that the strong antipathy many foreigners have for bush will now be foisted upon the united states at large .
those that peddle anti-americanism can simply equate the leader and his unpopular policies with the entire country .
others who normally would reject such rhetoric may simply let it slide , assuming the american electorate had the chance to reject the bush administration 's radically unilateralist course . on a number of issues , bush 's stance has irked america 's friends and allies overseas .
though none of washington 's partners expected the president to neglect america 's interests on the world stage , he has often shown little respect for the opinions of other nations . washington 's way instead of accepting modest constraints on the united states ' unprecedented power to lead by example , bush has repeatedly chosen to push a course to washington 's liking , regardless of the consequences .
or american leadership has simply been glaringly absent on matters such as human rights , free trade and the middle east peace process . unfortunately , the world can not simply ignore the united states and let bush go his own way .
his utter disregard for working globally on environmental concerns such as global warming and respecting international law poses a threat to all nations . much to the glee of many arch-conservatives in america and to the chagrin of most europeans , a second term for the texan will put both the kyoto treaty on global warming and the new international criminal court in jeopardy .
the united nations is also likely to remain sidelined at a time when greater cooperation is needed to counter the dangers of international terrorism and nuclear proliferation . america under bush may yet decide more can be achieved through greater cooperation instead of confrontation .
but if it does n't , at some point there is sure to be a backlash .
without goodwill from the rest of the world , it is untenable that a nation with less than five percent of the planet 's population uses the most energy and emits the most greenhouse gases . the united states can not solely depend on its unmatched military and economic might , unless it intends to rule by fear .

the information followed a short statement by a senior french military official who said " mr arafat is not dead . "
the palestinian authority president 's condition was " complex , " general christian estripeau , the spokesman for the french defence forces ' medical service , told reporters outside the paris military hospital which had been tending to arafat .
" the patient 's condition needs appropriate treatment which required his being transferred to a unit suited to his pathology on the afternoon of wednesday november 3 , " he said .
he refused to take questions , but said his statement had been prepared according to the wishes of arafat 's wife , suha .
earlier thursday , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and israeli media had reported that arafat had died .
" mr. arafat passed away a quarter of an hour ago , " juncker told reporters in brussels at 1640 gmt .
his aides later retracted the statement .
french president jacques chirac , who made an half-hour visit to the percy military training hospital where arafat had been admitted before going to brussels for an meeting with juncker and other eu leaders , refused to answer journalists ' questions as to whether arafat was dead .
palestinian officials in paris and the west bank spent the day denying the reports of arafat 's demise , but said their leader was in " critical condition " in the hospital 's intensive care unit .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qorei told reporters at his west bank headquarters in ramallah that arafat " is not in a coma . "
" there have been examinations and results are positive , " he said without elaborating .
" it is wrong .
if the president was dead , the whole world would know , " palestinian communications minister azzam al-ahmed told afp .
" but it is true that he is a very critical condition , " he added .
no diagnosis french medical sources said arafat 's health had suddenly and dramatically deteriorated wednesday while he was undergoing tests to determine the cause of an illness which prompted his medical evacuation to paris last friday .
a diagnosis of the illness has not been revealed .
palestinian officials said weekend tests had ruled out leukaemia or other cancers that might have explained the symptoms suffered by arafat , who had low levels of blood platelets needed for blood clotting .
in washington , newly re-elected us president george w. bush said " god bless his soul " when told by a reporter of the unconfirmed reports that the palestinian leader had died .
a us state department official later said : " the latest we have from the french is that he is in a criticial but semi-conscious state . "
no brain activity a french medical source said an electroencephalogram -lrb- eeg -rrb- , a type of brain scan , was carried out on arafat thursday - itself " a sign of extreme gravity " - and that there was no reading of any cerebral activity .
france has long supported arafat in his 40-year struggle for palestinian statehood , and chirac was said to have made the decision personally to provide hospital treatment for him .
arafat was said to have been well enough wednesday to welcome bush 's re-election and , according to one of his aides , said he hoped for a jumpstart to the moribund middle east peace process .
arafat 's departure from his battered west bank headquarters have sparked intense speculation about his eventual successor , but officials insist there is no power vacuum .
in arafat 's absence , qorei has taken over as acting head of the palestinian authority , while former premier mahmud abbas is temporarily heading the plo and arafat 's dominant fatah faction . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?
ailing palestinian leader yasser arafat has been flown to paris for medical treatment .
even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician .
-lrb- oct.29 , 2004 -rrb- eu : funds not used for palestinian terror following a preliminary investigation , the european union said tuesday it had found no evidence that donations to the palestinian authority had been misused to fund terrorist activities .

but the alterations to be made by incoming commission president jose barroso are set to be the minimum possible .
according to sources , barroso 's new line up will affect three commissioners - although five were criticized by meps .
the new italian commissioner is expected to be franco frattini , currently the country 's foreign minister ; he would fill the gap left by rocco buttiglione who stepped down over the weekend after causing a furor with his views on gays and women .
barroso is also expected to suggest that the newly proposed latvian commissioner , andris piebalgs take on the energy portfolio .
this would free up the hungarian laszlo kovacs , still supported by his government , to move to tax .
kovacs was strongly criticized by meps for being " incompetent " in the area of energy .
such moves would not affect the dutch and danish commissioners , neelie kroes and mariann fischer boel , both of whom have been accused of having conflicts of interests in their new positions .

but the alterations to be made by incoming commission president jose barroso are set to be the minimum possible .
according to sources , barroso 's new line up will affect three commissioners - although five were criticized by meps .
the new italian commissioner is expected to be franco frattini , currently the country 's foreign minister ; he would fill the gap left by rocco buttiglione who stepped down over the weekend after causing a furor with his views on gays and women .
barroso is also expected to suggest that the newly proposed latvian commissioner , andris piebalgs take on the energy portfolio .
this would free up the hungarian laszlo kovacs , still supported by his government , to move to tax .
kovacs was strongly criticized by meps for being " incompetent " in the area of energy .
such moves would not affect the dutch and danish commissioners , neelie kroes and mariann fischer boel , both of whom have been accused of having conflicts of interests in their new positions .

economists had expected an increase of at least one percent .
but orders fell 0.2 percent from august as rising unemployment continued to weigh on domestic demand , since it has caused people to rein in their spending .

but the alterations to be made by incoming commission president jose barroso are set to be the minimum possible .
according to sources , barroso 's new line up will affect three commissioners - although five were criticized by meps .
the new italian commissioner is expected to be franco frattini , currently the country 's foreign minister ; he would fill the gap left by rocco buttiglione who stepped down over the weekend after causing a furor with his views on gays and women .
barroso is also expected to suggest that the newly proposed latvian commissioner , andris piebalgs take on the energy portfolio .
this would free up the hungarian laszlo kovacs , still supported by his government , to move to tax .
kovacs was strongly criticized by meps for being " incompetent " in the area of energy .
such moves would not affect the dutch and danish commissioners , neelie kroes and mariann fischer boel , both of whom have been accused of having conflicts of interests in their new positions .

three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals . three german livestock farms have joined some 140 in holland and eight in belgium that have been shut down due to the presence - or suspected presence - of dioxin in their animal feed .

the french fries that were made from the rest of the potatoes have remained on the market , since the dioxin only stays on the skins , a mccain spokesman told reporters .
the sale of the feed has also been temporarily stopped , and an investigation is being carried out , mccain said .
belgium affected the belgian food safety agency said eight belgian farms had been closed as a precaution after the dutch dioxin scare .
the eight were mostly pig farms that had received the potato products from the netherlands to feed animals .
contaminated feed was at the root of recent european food scares , such as the discovery of an illegal hormone in dutch pigs in 2002 and a 1999 belgian scandal concerning dioxin in chickens .

the paper outlines how the eu could help build an effective palestinian security force , hold elections and continue reforms in the palestinian authority .

the paper represents a bid to inject some momentum into the middle east peace process , which has been moribund since the launch of the eu-backed roadmap .

economists had expected an increase of at least one percent .

wolfsburg have an increasing , but still narrow , lead over their nearest rivals ahead of week twelve with many others involved in mini struggles within the league . the bundesliga gets back to business after various mid-week european adventures this weekend .
week twelve poses many questions for the teams contesting the top spots and offers those in the basement the chance to turn around a disappointing season to date . still out in front and putting more daylight between themselves and their closest rivals are the wolves of wolfsburg .
the surprise league leaders showed their mettle last saturday when they came back from two goals down to defeat mainz 05 4-3 .
bulgarian international martin petrov scored an incredible four goals , including two penalties , for the wolves and their tails will be up when they travel to 12th place nuremberg this week . nuremberg managed to stay awake long enough in a tedious game at hansa rostock on saturday to win 2-0 and consign their opponents to the bottom of the league , handing them a dubious record as they did so .
with six straight home defeats , rostock made bundesliga history and tipped over the edge into an official crisis . rostock may not fair any better when they take the long journey from the very north of germany to the south for their visit to vfb stuttgart this weekend .
stuttgart , who looked like championship thoroughbreds in a field of stumbling ponies just three weeks ago , have long since waved goodbye to their unbeaten record and are on a losing streak themselves . second placed schlake keep the heat on stuttgart fell victim to schalke 04 manager ralf rangnick 's resurgent title contenders in a scorcher of a match in gelsenkirchen , losing 3-2 to the royal blues .

after going the first eight games unbeaten stuttgart have now lost three in a row . schalke travel to hamburg on sunday to face an hsv side on a slow rise out of the drop zone .
hamburg held the champions werder bremen to 1-1 draw on saturday , the latest in a run of more encouraging results the team have enjoyed after jettisoning klaus toppmöller as coach . bremen , fresh from thrashing anderlecht 5-1 in the champions league , travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin , another side on the rise after a stuttering start to the current campaign . the champions will feel confident after their european workout but will find a berlin side who have found their scoring touch .
hertha put freiburg to the sword last week in a 3-1 away win which consolidated berlin 's ninth position . freiburg in freefall freiburg have seen a positive start to the new season turn into a disaster .
from being up there in the top five at the start of the campaign , freiburg have slowly but surely slipped to second from bottom .
the southerners travel to leverkusen to face a potentially fired up bayer team out for revenge after losing to dortmund last weekend . however , the 1-1 draw which put as roma out of the champions league in midweek and helped their own chances of qualification could help leverkusen regain the more positive side of their spluttering form . borussia dortmund notched their first home win of the season over leverkusen in the 1-0 defeat , thanks to brazilian ewerthon who scored the only goal after 41 minutes .
the victory was a respite from the freefall the heavily in-debt have been suffering of late and it helped bvb hang on to 11th spot .
the team immediately above them , arminia bielefeld , play host on saturday , a week after losing 2-1 to kaiserslautern . jara gets stay of execution the victory gave kaiserslautern boss kurt jara another stay of execution after the dramatic comeback win over bielefeld .
substitute selim teber cancelled out delron buckley 's 79th minute opener and struck a late winner to move kaiserslautern off the bottom spot and to give their under-fire boss some breathing space . kaiserslautern have the opportunity to get further out of trouble at the expense of a side in danger of going further in the opposite direction .
bochum in 15th place lost again on saturday , going down 3-0 to hanover in a defeat that extended a miserable run and increased the club 's worst start ever to a bundesliga campaign . hanover are enjoying life in the lofty heights of fourth place ahead of their clash with faltering giants bayern munich on saturday .
the 3-0 win at home to bochum continued their current renaissance and lifted them up to within four points of the summit .
it is conceivable , given their opponents loss of form of late , that hanover could keep the unexpected pressure on with another victory in week twelve . spluttering bavarian giants risk disaster bayern suffered a major setback when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
bayern 's third defeat of the campaign means they slipped to fifth , four points adrift of leaders wolfsburg .
on top of that , a 1-0 loss at home to juventus in the champions league left bayern 's european ambitions on a knife edge . munich will be without brazilian world cup winner lucio on saturday after he was dismissed in the second half of last week 's league game for stomping on czech opponent vaclav sverkos , capping a miserable afternoon for felix magath 's bavarian outfit . playing bayern in your first match in charge is not ideal but interim borussia mönchengladbach chief horst koppel , who stepped in to replace holger fach when he was sacked on wednesday , kept a cool head - and goals from marcelo pletsch and joris van hout made his job easier .
his next match in charge will be away at fsv mainz . plucky mainz off the pace mainz have seen their own season hit a lull after pushing for the top spots for the first two months .
back-to-back defeats have seen the reds slip to seventh and the spirited but ultimately futile tussle with the wolves last week . the 4-3 defeat may have dented their chances of claiming an improbable first bundesliga title but it at least showed they have the scoring ability , something they will want to exploit against ' gladbach on saturday if they 're not to slip further out of contention . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern embarrassed , wolfsburg wins goalfest bayern munich suffered a major setback ahead of wednesday 's champions league clash with juventus when they fell to a shock 2-0 away defeat to borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .

economists had expected an increase of at least one percent .
but orders fell 0.2 percent from august as rising unemployment continued to weigh on domestic demand , since it has caused people to rein in their spending .
the september drop was the third in the last four months and economist say it underlines an underlying weakness in orders .
growth prospects have also been hampered by the continuing appreciation of the euro , which makes german exports , a key driver of the economy , more expensive abroad . more briefs 03.11.2004 -pipe- german monthly jobless numbers rise 03.11.2004 -pipe- german ebay buyers can return wares 03.11.2004 -pipe- unions , vw strike wage deal 02.11.2004 -pipe- signs of progress in vw wage talks 02.11.2004 -pipe- eu government lacks will to reform 02.11.2004 -pipe- german september retail sales stagnate 01.11.2004 -pipe- more vw workers strike amid wage talks 01.11.2004 -pipe- cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

right after birth babies face sudden and severe starvation as they have lost their nutrient supply from the placenta , but have yet to drink milk .
it appears they bridge the gap by breaking down cells , and releasing essential nutrients .
the study , by tokyo metropolitan institute of medical science , is published in nature . "
existing on internal proteins in this way would only be possible for a limited period . "
dr wolf reik the tokyo team studied newborn mice .
they found that a cellular process called autophagy ramps up immediately after birth and remains high for several hours .
during autophagy , a cell breaks down its own components in small digestive sacs called autophagosomes .
the researchers developed a way to monitor autophagic activity by making autophagosomes fluorescent .
they found mice genetically engineered so that they could not form autophagosomes died within one day of birth .
the researchers believe autophagy is essential immediately after birth for the production of amino acids , which are used either as an energy source or as building blocks for new proteins .
amino acid levels in the dead mice were significantly down .
severe starvation lead researcher dr noboru mizushima said : " for mammals , birth brings inescapable severe starvation .
" the transplacental nutrient supply is suddenly interrupted at birth , and neonates face severe starvation until supply can be restored by milk nutrients .
" our results suggest that mammals tide over such starvation by autophagic degradation of self-proteins , in other words , by eating themselves inside cells .
" although we do not have direct evidence that human babies do the same thing , it is very likely that all mammals overcome the physiological neonatal starvation by inducing autophagy , at least in part . "
some experts believe autophagy , while playing a key role in keeping cells clean , may also be implicated in the development of neurodegenerative conditions such as alzheimer 's disease .
the researchers believe their work will aid research in this area .
dr wolf reik , an expert in developmental genetics at the babraham institute in cambridge , told the bbc news website the study was " interesting and intriguing " .
" it is logical that a baby would need some sort of bridging mechanism to generate energy when its nutrition supply is cut off when it first leaves the womb .
" however , existing on internal proteins in this way would only be possible for a limited period , and a baby would quite quickly need to replace the lost nutrients from the outside . "
professor al aynsley-green , of great ormond street hospital , said the finding was not surprising , given the magnitude of changes that took place in the body 's systems in the period immediately after birth .

students who pass courses are awarded one of four classes : first , upper-second , lower-second or third .
but the author of the report , professor robert burgess , says this does not give enough information about candidates .
prof burgess , vice-chancellor of leicester university , suggests a fuller " progress file " could be needed so employers can judge them better .
the system of " credits " , where students gather up " points " towards a degree - sometimes at more than one university - is also discussed .
surge in top marks prof burgess notes there is " no obvious single alternative to the honours degree classification " .
alternatives he said : " examiners amass a vast quantity of information in order to be able to reach the summative degree classification and we believe there could be potential to make more of this more widely available . "
his report adds to a growing concern that degree classes - which started about 200 years ago - are not distinguishing between above-average candidates .
the quality assurance agency , which oversees standards in higher education , said there had been " no deterioration in quality " .
but critics remain unconvinced , saying top grades are becoming easier to achieve . "
universities are caught in a trap .
if they impose tough standards , they will be ruled out and become unattractive " david thomas in 2003 , the last year for which figures are available , 55.6 % of students gained an upper-second -lrb- 2:1 -rrb- grade or a first .
in the early 1980s around a third attained these , with some 60 % getting a lower second -lrb- 2:2 -rrb- .
liberal democratic peer lord oakshott told bbc news he was " very worried " about the integrity of degrees .
he said : " has something really changed so much that over the last five years we 're giving 46 % more firsts ?
" speaking not just as a party spokesman but as a concerned parent and an employer i really wonder what is going on .
these figures look very suspicious . "
david thomas , chief executive of the careers advisory research council , said prospective students were now looking at the proportion of 2:1s and firsts awarded by universities before applying .
as , overall , there were more higher education places than students - unlike in the past - it had become a " buyers ' market " .
to attract students , universities were forced to award more top grades , which were then devalued , mr thomas said .
he added : " universities are caught in a trap .
if they impose tough standards , they will be ruled out and become unattractive . "
upper-upper-second to counter the glut of 2:1s , mr thomas recommends sub-dividing that class of degree even further , to recognise the " very good but not quite first-class " students .
prof burgess said higher marks could possibly be equated to improvements in the quality of teaching .
but he said there was " an urgent need to devise an assessment system that reflects students ' achievements and provides a meaningful picture of their abilities to employers " .
however , the report acknowledges that the uk degree is a " robust , internationally recognised qualification " .
the higher education minister , kim howells , said : " any development of the current degree classification system is entirely for the sector to determine , in consultation with the main users - students and employers .
" but i agree with professor burgess it is absolutely essential that any changes do not undermine the high international standing of uk degrees . "
the report was carried out on behalf of universities uk -lrb- uuk -rrb- , which represents vice-chancellors , and the conference of principals , representing heads of higher education colleges .
uuk 's chief executive , baroness warwick , said the findings were of " great importance " and would involve a " radical change " if implemented .

students who pass courses are awarded one of four classes : first , upper-second , lower-second or third .
but the author of the report , professor robert burgess , says this does not give enough information about candidates .
prof burgess , vice-chancellor of leicester university , suggests a fuller " progress file " could be needed so employers can judge them better .
the system of " credits " , where students gather up " points " towards a degree - sometimes at more than one university - is also discussed .
surge in top marks prof burgess notes there is " no obvious single alternative to the honours degree classification " .
alternatives how two other countries do it he said : " examiners amass a vast quantity of information in order to be able to reach the summative degree classification and we believe there could be potential to make more of this more widely available . "
his report adds to a growing concern that degree classes - which started about 200 years ago - are not distinguishing between above-average candidates .
the quality assurance agency , which oversees standards in higher education , said there had been " no deterioration in quality " .
but critics remain unconvinced , saying top grades are becoming easier to achieve .
universities are caught in a trap .
if they impose tough standards , they will be ruled out and become unattractive david thomas in 2003 , the last year for which figures are available , 55.6 % of students gained an upper-second -lrb- 2:1 -rrb- grade or a first .

a welsh assembly government inspector had held an inquiry into plans for new offices in newtown by mid wales housing association .
the local authority had turned down the association 's proposals .
after several weeks of negotiations the authority now faces costs of £ 19,421.59 , following a planning inquiry in may .

he added : " planning committees are becoming no more than assembly government rubber stamping machines and councillors are not being allowed to refuse proposals without absolutely cast iron ' planning ' reasons . "
an assembly government spokeswoman said the likelihood of costs being awarded against councils was " remote " if planning applications had regard to relevant guidelines and procedures .
she said : " in this case the inspector concluded that the local planning authority failed to give a sufficiently complete , precise and specific reason for its decision to withhold permission .

the 1904 oil painting was sold as part of the impressionist and modern art evening sale at christie 's .
it was the first time the painting - titled londres , le parlement , effet de soleil dans le brouillard - had been offered on the open market .
the sale , which also included works by miro and van gogh , fetched a total of $ 128.2m -lrb- £ 69.3m -rrb- the monet painting is one of 19 depicting the houses of parliament , with the majority hanging in museums or galleries .
it had been estimated to fetch between $ 12m -lrb- £ 6.5m -rrb- and $ 18m -lrb- £ 9.7m -rrb- .
slow down bidding for miro 's la caresse des etoiles , which had never been on the open market before , reached $ 11.8m -lrb- £ 6.9m -rrb- .
the 1938 work was originally given away by miro 's dealer in exchange for a coat , following the liberation of paris in 1944 .
the auction was the first major sale of the autumn season and provided mixed fortunes on the night .
auctioneer christopher burge said that while there were strong results there appeared to be caution from bidders , indicating the art boom of the last few years could be slowing .
the third highest lot of the night was van gogh 's le pont de trinquetaille , which fetched $ 11.2m -lrb- £ 6m -rrb- , but fell well short of the estimated high of $ 18m -lrb- £ 9.7m -rrb- .

the 1904 oil painting was sold as part of the impressionist and modern art evening sale at christie 's .
it was the first time the painting - titled londres , le parlement , effet de soleil dans le brouillard - had been offered on the open market .
the sale , which also included works by miro and van gogh , fetched a total of $ 128.2m -lrb- £ 69.3m -rrb- the monet painting is one of 19 depicting the houses of parliament , with the majority hanging in museums or galleries .

darcey bussell returns to the stage after 18 months but it has n't been easy .
sylvia has n't been performed since 1965 , only two of its original cast members are still alive and the steps were never officially written down .
the man responsible for the delicate work of reconstruction is christopher newton .
he was ballet master under sir frederick and later artistic co-ordinator of the company until he retired in 2001 .
he 's taken two years to piece the ballet back together , using an old , grainy monochrome film of a rehearsal , production photographs and dancers ' notes .
but the revival depends largely on his own powers of recall .
newton appeared in the original production of sylvia as a trumpeter in act three .
but he used to stand in the wings and watch the performances from beginning to end .
founder " i have somewhat of a photographic memory , " he says .
" sometimes i ca n't necessarily remember steps , but i remember when something does n't look right .
i have a picture in my mind and i can usually come back to what the original should look like and should be . "
it 's like being in a new work and creating again in a way darcey bussell some might wonder how the royal ballet found itself in this situation in the first place , by failing to record the work of its founder choreographer .
but notation was in its infancy at the time , and sir frederick himself was disdainful of posterity .
he created sylvia for dame margot fonteyn .
on wednesday night , the royal ballet 's principal ballerina darcey bussell steps into her shoes .
" it 's a hard ballet for a dancer technically , it 's very strenuous , " she says .
" it 's an exhausting piece because there are quite a lot of jumps . "
but returning to the royal ballet after 18 months off to have her second child , darcey bussell says she 's relishing the challenge .
" because you have n't seen it before so you 've never memorised any of the solos it 's totally fresh .
i 'm sure we 'll see many pearls within the work anthony russell roberts , royal ballet " it 's like being in a new work and creating again in a way .
i love that .
to do another swan lake or beauty would be nothing .
this is so much more interesting and it 's fun . "
' masterpiece ' sylvia is a pastoral love story , featuring nymphs , satyrs , fauns and grottoes .
sir frederick himself described it as " boy loves girl , girl captured by bad man , girl restored to boy by god " .
when it first opened some critics derided its convoluted plot and sir frederick himself was n't entirely happy with it .
his nephew anthony russell roberts is now administrative director of the royal ballet .
he admits reviving sylvia is a risk .
" one is always a little bit frightened of excavations as to whether they are going to work .
there are some old fashioned bits of stagecraft with dryads and wheel barrows . "
but he adds : " whatever happens it 's absolutely right to do it and i 'm sure we 'll see many pearls within the work - perhaps even re-evaluate it as a masterpiece . "
shortly before his death in 1988 sir frederick ashton talked about re-working sylvia .
but it 's taken the centenary of his birth for it to happen .
sylvia is performed at the royal opera house from thursday , 4 november to friday 3 december .
