program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.08.2004 germany 's verheugen changes gears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's determined to rise to the challenge germany 's günter verheugen will soon take on the portfolio for enterprise and industry at the european commission .
the former commissioner for eu enlargement has also been pegged to become one of five vice-presidents . the road from his past position to his new one was anything but easy for günter verheugen .
when german chancellor gerhard schröder first dropped his name in the hat to become one of the commissioners responsible for the economy , verheugen showed lttle enthusiasm .
this was in part due to his own realization that he had little in the way of experience to bring to the post .
but it was also because of the way he completely threw himself into his former role as eu enlargement commissioner .
" the way that project went , as far as my personal role was concerned , was slightly old-fashioned , with endless , long discussions with numerous contacts , and lots and lots of listening - and i can add today - also with a lot of patience that was demanded from me , " verheugen told deutsche welle . it was a historic task , one that turned verheugen into someone who earned trust throught europe as an honest broker of expansion .
while celebrating his 60th birthday in april , verheugen already had an inkling that any new duties he might be given would only be more difficult . " when your work consists of a single large , international project , and you 're not dragged into the daily struggles of politics , it 's much easier to make a positive impression , " verheugen said , reflecting on how his image benefited from the enlargement process . a passionate european in the end , the social democrat accepted his new duties .
as respected and experienced as verheugen is , he was a clear choice for the job , even if he himself is only slowly warming to the position . " i 've become such a passionate european , that i 'm only too happy to use my experiences , my contacts , my knowledge and abilities to continue to serve the european idea , " he said . the incoming president of the european commission - jose barroso - has made it clear that he wants verheugen to take a central role in forming economic policy .
verheugen 's main task will be to ensure that any new eu rules wo n't unduly handicap eu companies that have to compete with american and asian rivals .
he wo n't be a so-called " super-commissioner , " as chancellor schröder had pushed for .
that would only provoke others . popular at home verheugen 's name also regularly makes the rounds when important positions at home in berlin open up .
he enjoys the chancellor 's respect and has a colorful career on the german political stage behind him . in the very beginning of the 1980s , verheugen was secretary general of the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , before switching to the social democrats in 1982 .
he was a member of parliament , editor-in-chief of the socialist newspaper vorwärts , and a deputy minister in the foreign ministry .
he 's been in brussels since 1999 . for now though , verheugen will have to disregard gerhard schröder 's national interests .
he 's an eu commissioner , not the agent of german industrial politics .
and that 's an experience that could prove painful for both sides . christopher plass -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 olympic games : cash cow or money pit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are pretty , but are they worth it ?
when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals . " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . " since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even . the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in 2002 dash off from the start at the olympic stadium in munich , built for the 1972 games there .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt . " if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said . olympian hangover analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsorshops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses . " it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . " massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most cities simply do not need all the facilities . even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision . not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics will bring a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's olympics logo in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy . but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out for the best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian . " they might have a nice secondary effect on the economy , " he said . " but they are n't a primary driver .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 new berlin airport prepares for take-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld could soon become berlin 's biggest airport after years of uncertainty , berlin has been given the green light to press ahead with the expansion of its schönefeld airport in the city 's east , but opposition to the project remains strong . divided as it was for three decades , berlin needed more than one airport .
tempelhof city airport , which was built under hitler , and tegel , which appeared on the scene in the 1970s catered to the needs of the west , whilst schönefeld , on the edge of berlin , served the east .
now the latter , which has a distinctly provincial feel to it , is on track to become a major site for both domestic and international air traffic . however , the endorsement of the project , which is worth € 1.7 billion -lrb- $ 2.07 billion -rrb- , comes with strict conditions attached .
first and foremost are the issues of minimizing sound pollution for local residents , and protecting nature and the environment around the planned site .
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. , only " quiet " aircraft will be allowed to take off or land , sound barriers will have to be erected , and , for the 10,000 trees which will be felled to clear space , 20,000 new ones will have to be planted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld currently serves several low-budget airlines matthias platzeck , state premier of brandenburg , where schönefeld is located , welcomed the decision as a " milestone in the implementation of the most important infrastructure project in the region . "
he said he expected airport to generate many new jobs and create new economic impulses in the region . groundswell of complaint the project , which has been in the workings for the past 13 years , might have cleared the first major hurdle to becoming reality , but there 's still a long way to go before building can get underway .
the ultimate decision will depend on the outcome of legal proceedings which a residents ' movement in berlin and brandenburg , bvbb , has promised to launch in opposition to the project .
ten thousand people have already lodged complaints and are prepared to go to court to fight what they consider a ridiculous decision . " no major airport has been built in such a densely populated area anywhere in the world for the past 30 years , " ferdi breidbach , chairman of bvbb , told the der spiegel newsmagazine . the class-action suit , which will be dealt at the federal constitutional court in leipzig , will take between one and two years to process , which means that even if the ruling fell in favor of the new airport , construction could n't begin until 2006 at the earliest .
in any case , that is the planned start date .
germany 's deputy transport minister tilo braune told the süddeutsche zeitung daily he is confident that building will indeed begin on schedule . out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof : what will become of the building is not yet clear regardless of the way forward for schönefeld , berlin is already poised to lose one of its three airports .
tempelhof , which sits snugly between houses in the heart of the city , will watch the last plane soar to the skies from its runway at the end of october .
constructed under hitler , the imposing building is under historical protection and , as such , will remain standing .
but as yet there 's no consensus on its future use . as for tegel , which presently deals with the majority of the german capital 's international air traffic , current plans predict that it should close its doors forever in 2010 .
but there 's a long way to go until then , and there could be some vigorous pockets of turbulence en-route . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport to close time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .

in any case , that is the planned start date .

the move came after britain on wednesday gave scientists the go ahead to clone human embryos for purposes of medical research .
british law , however , still prohibits the actual cloning of humans .
leading the charge , the german medical association called for the complete prohibition of all forms of embryo cloning .
" we ca n't allow embryos to be harvested like raw materials , " association president jörg-dietrich hoppe told reporters .
other medical experts concurred .
" the indivisibility of human rights are being eroded under the blanket of research freedom , " said frank ulrich montgomery , chairman of the marburger association of doctors .
he also called for a europe-wide law protecting embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of human embryos most politicians united wolfgang wodarg - a member of the ruling social democratic party and chairman off the bio-ethics commission in the bundestag , germany 's parliament - called britain 's decision a " catastrophe . "
the social democrats ' junior coalition partner , the greens , have also called for the international community to forbid cloning .
" it 's up the german politicians to work towards holding together the nations that have spoken out against cloning , " christa nickels , a leading green and chairwoman of the bundestag 's human rights committee , told public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
a cloning ban also found resonance with germany 's conservative opposition .
the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , called for the imposition of a cloning ban and criticized britain 's move as " unacceptable . " maria böhmer , deputy chair of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said that by allowing cloning " the human being is degraded to a material .
it 's an extremely alarming and disastrous development for europe . "
not a single one of germany 's three biggest parties supports the lifting of the current ban - even for medical research . nickels of the greens noted that enormous progress has been made in conventional treatment of a number of diseases .
citing diabetes as an example , nickels said the disease could be effectively and inexpensively fought using preventative measures like nutrition programs for children .
discord prevails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : science has come a long way since dolly was cloned in 1996 however , the move by the british found support in at least one mainstream german political quarter .
the neo-liberal free democrat party called the move to allowing human embryo cloning a " logical step , " since cloned animal cells have been used in britain since 2001 without breaking any taboos .
it would be irresponsible to promote the " patient tourism , " which would result if one country developed therapies unavailable in others , just so germany " can stay in its own ivory castle , " said ulrike flach , an fdp member and chairwoman of the bundestag 's research committee .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of human embryos most politicians united wolfgang wodarg - a member of the ruling social democratic party and chairman off the bio-ethics commission in the bundestag , germany 's parliament - called britain 's decision a " catastrophe . "
the social democrats ' junior coalition partner , the greens , have also called for the international community to forbid cloning .
" it 's up the german politicians to work towards holding together the nations that have spoken out against cloning , " christa nickels , a leading green and chairwoman of the bundestag 's human rights committee , told public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
a cloning ban also found resonance with germany 's conservative opposition .
the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , called for the imposition of a cloning ban and criticized britain 's move as " unacceptable . " maria böhmer , deputy chair of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said that by allowing cloning " the human being is degraded to a material .
it 's an extremely alarming and disastrous development for europe . "
not a single one of germany 's three biggest parties supports the lifting of the current ban - even for medical research . nickels of the greens noted that enormous progress has been made in conventional treatment of a number of diseases .
citing diabetes as an example , nickels said the disease could be effectively and inexpensively fought using preventative measures like nutrition programs for children .
discord prevails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : science has come a long way since dolly was cloned in 1996 however , the move by the british found support in at least one mainstream german political quarter .
the neo-liberal free democrat party called the move to allowing human embryo cloning a " logical step , " since cloned animal cells have been used in britain since 2001 without breaking any taboos .
it would be irresponsible to promote the " patient tourism , " which would result if one country developed therapies unavailable in others , just so germany " can stay in its own ivory castle , " said ulrike flach , an fdp member and chairwoman of the bundestag 's research committee .

bernauerstrasse - the street that marks the boundary between the mitte district , which was part of the soviet-occupied sector , and the french-controlled wedding neighborhood - was a closed and heavily guarded border as well as the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70-meter section of the original wall and a documentation center about its history .

now the clamor to find it .
friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .
recently , the city has rushed to preserve the remains of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists .
there 's still plenty to see . the scene rarely varies .
a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " at checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so , where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
forty-three years after construction of the wall began and 15 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company berlin starting point told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest in the berlin wall , " especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century , and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the wall began in 1961 .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometer concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided its people .
however , no imagination is needed to recall the ways in which the wall had a devastating effect on the lives of east germans .
more than 75,000 people were imprisoned for trying to escape , and a total of 239 people were killed trying to get over the wall during its 28-year history .
only 5,043 managed to escape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some parts of berlin , small stones and plaques are the only remaining reminders of the city 's cold war history all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 olympic games : cash cow or money pit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are pretty , but are they worth it ?
when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals . " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . " since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even . the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in 2002 dash off from the start at the olympic stadium in munich , built for the 1972 games there .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt . " if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said . olympian hangover analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsorshops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses . " it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . " massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most cities simply do not need all the facilities . even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision . not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics will bring a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's olympics logo in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy . but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out for the best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian . " they might have a nice secondary effect on the economy , " he said . " but they are n't a primary driver .

dw-world readers side with the nudists . i would not feel the slightest bit uncomfortable sharing the beach with nudists .
i only wish that we were advanced enough here in pennsylvania to be even having this debate ! - dan russo it would not bother me at all to be on a beach with nudists .
i 'm suprised by this article .
i always thought that the german people were comfortable with nudity . - brent donohoe sadly , i ’ ve read that there is an effort to restrict some areas of nude bathing in germany .
personally i feel this is a mistake .
living in a country that deems public nudity as a crime , i can only hope that the german people do not allow this attitude to befall them .
since my first visit to a nude beach , i have found that being unclothed is not only most relaxing but a natural feeling as well .
my family and i will continue to travel to germany during our summer vacations and will visit the nude beaches .
i am a tourist and i am in favor of keeping the nude beaches free and open .
this is one tourist who goes to germany for the nude beaches .
it ’ s time to ask the tourist industry how much money will they lose if the fkk -lrb- nudist -rrb- beaches are closed . - wayne stanfield fkk should have right to move in what they like and textile people should refrain from going there .

the former commissioner for eu enlargement has also been pegged to become one of five vice-presidents . the road from his past position to his new one was anything but easy for günter verheugen .
when german chancellor gerhard schröder first dropped his name in the hat to become one of the commissioners responsible for the economy , verheugen showed lttle enthusiasm .
this was in part due to his own realization that he had little in the way of experience to bring to the post .
but it was also because of the way he completely threw himself into his former role as eu enlargement commissioner .
" the way that project went , as far as my personal role was concerned , was slightly old-fashioned , with endless , long discussions with numerous contacts , and lots and lots of listening - and i can add today - also with a lot of patience that was demanded from me , " verheugen told deutsche welle . it was a historic task , one that turned verheugen into someone who earned trust throught europe as an honest broker of expansion .
while celebrating his 60th birthday in april , verheugen already had an inkling that any new duties he might be given would only be more difficult . " when your work consists of a single large , international project , and you 're not dragged into the daily struggles of politics , it 's much easier to make a positive impression , " verheugen said , reflecting on how his image benefited from the enlargement process . a passionate european in the end , the social democrat accepted his new duties .
as respected and experienced as verheugen is , he was a clear choice for the job , even if he himself is only slowly warming to the position . " i 've become such a passionate european , that i 'm only too happy to use my experiences , my contacts , my knowledge and abilities to continue to serve the european idea , " he said . the incoming president of the european commission - jose barroso - has made it clear that he wants verheugen to take a central role in forming economic policy .
verheugen 's main task will be to ensure that any new eu rules wo n't unduly handicap eu companies that have to compete with american and asian rivals .
he wo n't be a so-called " super-commissioner , " as chancellor schröder had pushed for .
that would only provoke others . popular at home verheugen 's name also regularly makes the rounds when important positions at home in berlin open up .
he enjoys the chancellor 's respect and has a colorful career on the german political stage behind him . in the very beginning of the 1980s , verheugen was secretary general of the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , before switching to the social democrats in 1982 .
he was a member of parliament , editor-in-chief of the socialist newspaper vorwärts , and a deputy minister in the foreign ministry .
he 's been in brussels since 1999 . for now though , verheugen will have to disregard gerhard schröder 's national interests .
he 's an eu commissioner , not the agent of german industrial politics .

" the way that project went , as far as my personal role was concerned , was slightly old-fashioned , with endless , long discussions with numerous contacts , and lots and lots of listening - and i can add today - also with a lot of patience that was demanded from me , " verheugen told deutsche welle . it was a historic task , one that turned verheugen into someone who earned trust throught europe as an honest broker of expansion .
while celebrating his 60th birthday in april , verheugen already had an inkling that any new duties he might be given would only be more difficult . " when your work consists of a single large , international project , and you 're not dragged into the daily struggles of politics , it 's much easier to make a positive impression , " verheugen said , reflecting on how his image benefited from the enlargement process . a passionate european in the end , the social democrat accepted his new duties .
as respected and experienced as verheugen is , he was a clear choice for the job , even if he himself is only slowly warming to the position . " i 've become such a passionate european , that i 'm only too happy to use my experiences , my contacts , my knowledge and abilities to continue to serve the european idea , " he said . the incoming president of the european commission - jose barroso - has made it clear that he wants verheugen to take a central role in forming economic policy .
verheugen 's main task will be to ensure that any new eu rules wo n't unduly handicap eu companies that have to compete with american and asian rivals .
he wo n't be a so-called " super-commissioner , " as chancellor schröder had pushed for .
that would only provoke others . popular at home verheugen 's name also regularly makes the rounds when important positions at home in berlin open up .
he enjoys the chancellor 's respect and has a colorful career on the german political stage behind him . in the very beginning of the 1980s , verheugen was secretary general of the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , before switching to the social democrats in 1982 .
he was a member of parliament , editor-in-chief of the socialist newspaper vorwärts , and a deputy minister in the foreign ministry .
he 's been in brussels since 1999 . for now though , verheugen will have to disregard gerhard schröder 's national interests .
he 's an eu commissioner , not the agent of german industrial politics .
and that 's an experience that could prove painful for both sides . christopher plass -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

the move came after britain on wednesday gave scientists the go ahead to clone human embryos for purposes of medical research .
british law , however , still prohibits the actual cloning of humans .
leading the charge , the german medical association called for the complete prohibition of all forms of embryo cloning .
" we ca n't allow embryos to be harvested like raw materials , " association president jörg-dietrich hoppe told reporters .
other medical experts concurred .
" the indivisibility of human rights are being eroded under the blanket of research freedom , " said frank ulrich montgomery , chairman of the marburger association of doctors .
he also called for a europe-wide law protecting embryos .

"
the social democrats ' junior coalition partner , the greens , have also called for the international community to forbid cloning .
" it 's up the german politicians to work towards holding together the nations that have spoken out against cloning , " christa nickels , a leading green and chairwoman of the bundestag 's human rights committee , told public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
a cloning ban also found resonance with germany 's conservative opposition .
the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , called for the imposition of a cloning ban and criticized britain 's move as " unacceptable . " maria böhmer , deputy chair of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said that by allowing cloning " the human being is degraded to a material .
it 's an extremely alarming and disastrous development for europe . "
not a single one of germany 's three biggest parties supports the lifting of the current ban - even for medical research . nickels of the greens noted that enormous progress has been made in conventional treatment of a number of diseases .
citing diabetes as an example , nickels said the disease could be effectively and inexpensively fought using preventative measures like nutrition programs for children .

the neo-liberal free democrat party called the move to allowing human embryo cloning a " logical step , " since cloned animal cells have been used in britain since 2001 without breaking any taboos .
it would be irresponsible to promote the " patient tourism , " which would result if one country developed therapies unavailable in others , just so germany " can stay in its own ivory castle , " said ulrike flach , an fdp member and chairwoman of the bundestag 's research committee .

dw-world readers side with the nudists . i would not feel the slightest bit uncomfortable sharing the beach with nudists .
i only wish that we were advanced enough here in pennsylvania to be even having this debate ! - dan russo it would not bother me at all to be on a beach with nudists .
i 'm suprised by this article .
i always thought that the german people were comfortable with nudity . - brent donohoe sadly , i ’ ve read that there is an effort to restrict some areas of nude bathing in germany .
personally i feel this is a mistake .
living in a country that deems public nudity as a crime , i can only hope that the german people do not allow this attitude to befall them .
since my first visit to a nude beach , i have found that being unclothed is not only most relaxing but a natural feeling as well .
my family and i will continue to travel to germany during our summer vacations and will visit the nude beaches .
i am a tourist and i am in favor of keeping the nude beaches free and open .
this is one tourist who goes to germany for the nude beaches .
it ’ s time to ask the tourist industry how much money will they lose if the fkk -lrb- nudist -rrb- beaches are closed . - wayne stanfield fkk should have right to move in what they like and textile people should refrain from going there .

in die welt 's analysis , " other countries have successfully modernized their social system and job markets , " and germany can too , if it gets past its " defeatists , tacticians , and destructive criticism . "
on the other hand , neues deutschland , also from berlin , denounced the proposed reforms as the product of " ignorance , arrogance and incompetence . "
the paper wrote , " the protesters plan to continue next monday , regardless of attempts to dismiss them as populists . "
the paper then asked , what 's so populist about rejecting a proposal that - despite the chancellor 's " small concessions - continues to hurt the majority and bring a few cents more to a minority ? "
now that protesters know " pressure from the streets is effective , " they may actually be more motivated to continue next monday , the financial times deutschland from hamburg predicted .
german papers were , however , very much in agreement about the choice of german social democrat günter verheugen as the new eu industry commissioner .
chancellor gerhard schröder had called for a eu " super commissioner " for economy and competitiveness , but all the papers agreed , " verheugen will be no super commissioner . "
but they hoped he would bring a new level of german influence to the commission .

now the clamor to find it .
friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .
recently , the city has rushed to preserve the remains of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists .
there 's still plenty to see . the scene rarely varies .
a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " at checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so , where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
forty-three years after construction of the wall began and 15 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company berlin starting point told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest in the berlin wall , " especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century , and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the wall began in 1961 .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometer concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided its people .
however , no imagination is needed to recall the ways in which the wall had a devastating effect on the lives of east germans .
more than 75,000 people were imprisoned for trying to escape , and a total of 239 people were killed trying to get over the wall during its 28-year history .
only 5,043 managed to escape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some parts of berlin , small stones and plaques are the only remaining reminders of the city 's cold war history all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .
did you know ?
bernauerstrasse - the street that marks the boundary between the mitte district , which was part of the soviet-occupied sector , and the french-controlled wedding neighborhood - was a closed and heavily guarded border as well as the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70-meter section of the original wall and a documentation center about its history .
a short distance away , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a guard post tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmac-covered strip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topography of terror memorial in berlin peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-meter-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the topography of terror .
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of .
better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for cold war sleuths and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der schauspieler tom luszeit steht am donnerstag -lrb- 27.05.2004 -rrb- vor dem checkpoint charlie in berlin .

the souvenir shop here also sells pieces of the wall , a hot-selling item among tourists .
to the west of the museum lies the east side gallery in the mühlenstrasse , the largest surviving chunk of the wall .
it is a full 1,300 meters long and also a massive open-air art gallery .
after the wall was opened in 1989 , hundreds of artists from all over the world transformed a plain eastern side stretch of it into a drawing-board for their art .
the result is a spectacular display of color and shapes on what was once gray concrete .
bildunterschrift : 07.05.2000 , berlin / friedrichshain : das morsche mauerstück mit 114 gemälden entlang der mühlenstraße ist kein schöner anblick mehr : die meisten bilder sind verwittert , von mauerspechten zerhackt oder schlicht übermalt .

city wakes up to the potential of the wall realizing the tourist magnet that the last bits of the wall had become , city authorities put them under the monument protection act and thus took responsibility for their preservation and restoration .
petra rohland , spokeswoman for the senate administration for city development told dw-world that " we ’ re trying to integrate the last remains of the berlin wall in the city profile – as an admonishment as well as proof of a living history .
she admits that the city 's coffers are empty , so there ca n't be any " luxurious restoration " of the wall .
but she says that the interest in the berlin wall world-wide is so overwhelming that " there are always some takers for shouldering the costs .

the move came after britain on wednesday gave scientists the go ahead to clone human embryos for purposes of medical research .
british law , however , still prohibits the actual cloning of humans .
leading the charge , the german medical association called for the complete prohibition of all forms of embryo cloning .
" we ca n't allow embryos to be harvested like raw materials , " association president jörg-dietrich hoppe told reporters .
other medical experts concurred .
" the indivisibility of human rights are being eroded under the blanket of research freedom , " said frank ulrich montgomery , chairman of the marburger association of doctors .
he also called for a europe-wide law protecting embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of human embryos most politicians united wolfgang wodarg - a member of the ruling social democratic party and chairman off the bio-ethics commission in the bundestag , germany 's parliament - called britain 's decision a " catastrophe . "
the social democrats ' junior coalition partner , the greens , have also called for the international community to forbid cloning .
" it 's up the german politicians to work towards holding together the nations that have spoken out against cloning , " christa nickels , a leading green and chairwoman of the bundestag 's human rights committee , told public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
a cloning ban also found resonance with germany 's conservative opposition .
the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , called for the imposition of a cloning ban and criticized britain 's move as " unacceptable . " maria böhmer , deputy chair of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said that by allowing cloning " the human being is degraded to a material .
it 's an extremely alarming and disastrous development for europe . "
not a single one of germany 's three biggest parties supports the lifting of the current ban - even for medical research . nickels of the greens noted that enormous progress has been made in conventional treatment of a number of diseases .
citing diabetes as an example , nickels said the disease could be effectively and inexpensively fought using preventative measures like nutrition programs for children .
discord prevails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : science has come a long way since dolly was cloned in 1996 however , the move by the british found support in at least one mainstream german political quarter .
the neo-liberal free democrat party called the move to allowing human embryo cloning a " logical step , " since cloned animal cells have been used in britain since 2001 without breaking any taboos .
it would be irresponsible to promote the " patient tourism , " which would result if one country developed therapies unavailable in others , just so germany " can stay in its own ivory castle , " said ulrike flach , an fdp member and chairwoman of the bundestag 's research committee . " german politicians are finally going to have to start dealing with therapeutic genetic questions , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain approves human cloning britain has become the first country in europe to approve the use of human cloning for medical purposes : a university department won the controversial right to clone human embryos and to use them to create stem cells .

the move came after britain on wednesday gave scientists the go ahead to clone human embryos for purposes of medical research .
british law , however , still prohibits the actual cloning of humans .
leading the charge , the german medical association called for the complete prohibition of all forms of embryo cloning .
" we ca n't allow embryos to be harvested like raw materials , " association president jörg-dietrich hoppe told reporters .
other medical experts concurred .

now the clamor to find it .
friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .
recently , the city has rushed to preserve the remains of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists .
there 's still plenty to see . the scene rarely varies .
a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " at checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so , where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
forty-three years after construction of the wall began and 15 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company berlin starting point told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest in the berlin wall , " especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century , and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the wall began in 1961 .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometer concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided its people .
however , no imagination is needed to recall the ways in which the wall had a devastating effect on the lives of east germans .
more than 75,000 people were imprisoned for trying to escape , and a total of 239 people were killed trying to get over the wall during its 28-year history .
only 5,043 managed to escape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some parts of berlin , small stones and plaques are the only remaining reminders of the city 's cold war history all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .
did you know ?
bernauerstrasse - the street that marks the boundary between the mitte district , which was part of the soviet-occupied sector , and the french-controlled wedding neighborhood - was a closed and heavily guarded border as well as the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70-meter section of the original wall and a documentation center about its history .
a short distance away , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a guard post tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmac-covered strip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topography of terror memorial in berlin peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-meter-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the topography of terror .
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of .
better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for cold war sleuths and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .

the souvenir shop here also sells pieces of the wall , a hot-selling item among tourists .
to the west of the museum lies the east side gallery in the mühlenstrasse , the largest surviving chunk of the wall .
it is a full 1,300 meters long and also a massive open-air art gallery .
after the wall was opened in 1989 , hundreds of artists from all over the world transformed a plain eastern side stretch of it into a drawing-board for their art .
the result is a spectacular display of color and shapes on what was once gray concrete .

petra rohland , spokeswoman for the senate administration for city development told dw-world that " we ’ re trying to integrate the last remains of the berlin wall in the city profile – as an admonishment as well as proof of a living history .
she admits that the city 's coffers are empty , so there ca n't be any " luxurious restoration " of the wall .

bernauerstrasse - the street that marks the boundary between the mitte district , which was part of the soviet-occupied sector , and the french-controlled wedding neighborhood - was a closed and heavily guarded border as well as the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70-meter section of the original wall and a documentation center about its history .
a short distance away , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a guard post tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmac-covered strip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topography of terror memorial in berlin peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-meter-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the topography of terror .
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of .
better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for cold war sleuths and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .

the souvenir shop here also sells pieces of the wall , a hot-selling item among tourists .
to the west of the museum lies the east side gallery in the mühlenstrasse , the largest surviving chunk of the wall .
it is a full 1,300 meters long and also a massive open-air art gallery .
after the wall was opened in 1989 , hundreds of artists from all over the world transformed a plain eastern side stretch of it into a drawing-board for their art .
the result is a spectacular display of color and shapes on what was once gray concrete .

personally i feel this is a mistake .
living in a country that deems public nudity as a crime , i can only hope that the german people do not allow this attitude to befall them .
since my first visit to a nude beach , i have found that being unclothed is not only most relaxing but a natural feeling as well .
my family and i will continue to travel to germany during our summer vacations and will visit the nude beaches .
i am a tourist and i am in favor of keeping the nude beaches free and open .

now the clamor to find it .
friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .
recently , the city has rushed to preserve the remains of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists .
there 's still plenty to see . the scene rarely varies .
a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " at checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so , where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
forty-three years after construction of the wall began and 15 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company berlin starting point told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest in the berlin wall , " especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century , and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .

dw-world readers side with the nudists . i would not feel the slightest bit uncomfortable sharing the beach with nudists .
i only wish that we were advanced enough here in pennsylvania to be even having this debate ! - dan russo it would not bother me at all to be on a beach with nudists .
i 'm suprised by this article .
i always thought that the german people were comfortable with nudity . - brent donohoe sadly , i ’ ve read that there is an effort to restrict some areas of nude bathing in germany .
personally i feel this is a mistake .
living in a country that deems public nudity as a crime , i can only hope that the german people do not allow this attitude to befall them .
since my first visit to a nude beach , i have found that being unclothed is not only most relaxing but a natural feeling as well .
my family and i will continue to travel to germany during our summer vacations and will visit the nude beaches .
i am a tourist and i am in favor of keeping the nude beaches free and open .
this is one tourist who goes to germany for the nude beaches .
it ’ s time to ask the tourist industry how much money will they lose if the fkk -lrb- nudist -rrb- beaches are closed . - wayne stanfield fkk should have right to move in what they like and textile people should refrain from going there .

the move came after britain on wednesday gave scientists the go ahead to clone human embryos for purposes of medical research .
british law , however , still prohibits the actual cloning of humans .
leading the charge , the german medical association called for the complete prohibition of all forms of embryo cloning .
" we ca n't allow embryos to be harvested like raw materials , " association president jörg-dietrich hoppe told reporters .
other medical experts concurred .
" the indivisibility of human rights are being eroded under the blanket of research freedom , " said frank ulrich montgomery , chairman of the marburger association of doctors .
he also called for a europe-wide law protecting embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of human embryos most politicians united wolfgang wodarg - a member of the ruling social democratic party and chairman off the bio-ethics commission in the bundestag , germany 's parliament - called britain 's decision a " catastrophe . "
the social democrats ' junior coalition partner , the greens , have also called for the international community to forbid cloning .
" it 's up the german politicians to work towards holding together the nations that have spoken out against cloning , " christa nickels , a leading green and chairwoman of the bundestag 's human rights committee , told public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
a cloning ban also found resonance with germany 's conservative opposition .
the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , called for the imposition of a cloning ban and criticized britain 's move as " unacceptable . " maria böhmer , deputy chair of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said that by allowing cloning " the human being is degraded to a material .
it 's an extremely alarming and disastrous development for europe . "
not a single one of germany 's three biggest parties supports the lifting of the current ban - even for medical research . nickels of the greens noted that enormous progress has been made in conventional treatment of a number of diseases .
citing diabetes as an example , nickels said the disease could be effectively and inexpensively fought using preventative measures like nutrition programs for children .
discord prevails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : science has come a long way since dolly was cloned in 1996 however , the move by the british found support in at least one mainstream german political quarter .
the neo-liberal free democrat party called the move to allowing human embryo cloning a " logical step , " since cloned animal cells have been used in britain since 2001 without breaking any taboos .
it would be irresponsible to promote the " patient tourism , " which would result if one country developed therapies unavailable in others , just so germany " can stay in its own ivory castle , " said ulrike flach , an fdp member and chairwoman of the bundestag 's research committee . " german politicians are finally going to have to start dealing with therapeutic genetic questions , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain approves human cloning britain has become the first country in europe to approve the use of human cloning for medical purposes : a university department won the controversial right to clone human embryos and to use them to create stem cells .

the talks will concentrate on bulgaria 's accession to the european union . the chancellor will stay in bulgaria for almost ten hours on a visit which is seen as symbolic of his support for bilateral political relations , economic cooperation and bulgaria 's entry into the eu .
it 's only a matter of months until the eu summit , at which the date for bulgaria 's accession will be decided . last year , the mood between germany and bulgaria suffered under sofia 's promise to support us troops in the war against iraq , a war most germans openly opposed .
but during a visit to berlin in may bulgarian prime minister simeon saxe-coburg gotha and schröder sought to smooth over the rough spots in the diplomatic relationship , stressing that ties between the countries were back on a more even keel .
both german economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel have visited bulgaria since . new trade partner for germany ? the bulgarians place great importance on cooperation with their german partners .
bilateral trade relations were up by 40 percent in 2003 , and german companies have ploughed € 600 million -lrb- $ 731 million -rrb- into bulgaria in the past 12 months , making them the second largest investors there .
major german companies , including allianz , deutsche bank and metro , already have a presence on the bulgarian market .
last month , german energy giant e.on won the tender for the privatization of an electricity company in the former eastern bloc country .

but the decision will ultimately depend on a progress report by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and the outcome of an eu summit planned for this autumn . during his visit schröder is also expected to raise issues of corruption and crime with gotha , both of which could pose hurdles to bulgaria making it into the eu .
the two leaders will also talk about the future place of turkey and countries from the western balkans in the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 olympic games : cash cow or money pit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are pretty , but are they worth it ?
when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals . " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . " since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even . the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in 2002 dash off from the start at the olympic stadium in munich , built for the 1972 games there .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt . " if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said . olympian hangover analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsorshops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses . " it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . " massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most cities simply do not need all the facilities . even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision . not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics will bring a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .

when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals . " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . " since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even . the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in 2002 dash off from the start at the olympic stadium in munich , built for the 1972 games there .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt . " if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said . olympian hangover analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsorshops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses . " it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . " massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most cities simply do not need all the facilities . even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision . not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics will bring a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's olympics logo in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 new berlin airport prepares for take-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld could soon become berlin 's biggest airport after years of uncertainty , berlin has been given the green light to press ahead with the expansion of its schönefeld airport in the city 's east , but opposition to the project remains strong . divided as it was for three decades , berlin needed more than one airport .
tempelhof city airport , which was built under hitler , and tegel , which appeared on the scene in the 1970s catered to the needs of the west , whilst schönefeld , on the edge of berlin , served the east .
now the latter , which has a distinctly provincial feel to it , is on track to become a major site for both domestic and international air traffic . however , the endorsement of the project , which is worth € 1.7 billion -lrb- $ 2.07 billion -rrb- , comes with strict conditions attached .
first and foremost are the issues of minimizing sound pollution for local residents , and protecting nature and the environment around the planned site .
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. , only " quiet " aircraft will be allowed to take off or land , sound barriers will have to be erected , and , for the 10,000 trees which will be felled to clear space , 20,000 new ones will have to be planted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld currently serves several low-budget airlines matthias platzeck , state premier of brandenburg , where schönefeld is located , welcomed the decision as a " milestone in the implementation of the most important infrastructure project in the region . "
he said he expected airport to generate many new jobs and create new economic impulses in the region . groundswell of complaint the project , which has been in the workings for the past 13 years , might have cleared the first major hurdle to becoming reality , but there 's still a long way to go before building can get underway .
the ultimate decision will depend on the outcome of legal proceedings which a residents ' movement in berlin and brandenburg , bvbb , has promised to launch in opposition to the project .
ten thousand people have already lodged complaints and are prepared to go to court to fight what they consider a ridiculous decision . " no major airport has been built in such a densely populated area anywhere in the world for the past 30 years , " ferdi breidbach , chairman of bvbb , told the der spiegel newsmagazine . the class-action suit , which will be dealt at the federal constitutional court in leipzig , will take between one and two years to process , which means that even if the ruling fell in favor of the new airport , construction could n't begin until 2006 at the earliest .
in any case , that is the planned start date .
germany 's deputy transport minister tilo braune told the süddeutsche zeitung daily he is confident that building will indeed begin on schedule . out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof : what will become of the building is not yet clear regardless of the way forward for schönefeld , berlin is already poised to lose one of its three airports .
tempelhof , which sits snugly between houses in the heart of the city , will watch the last plane soar to the skies from its runway at the end of october .
constructed under hitler , the imposing building is under historical protection and , as such , will remain standing .
but as yet there 's no consensus on its future use . as for tegel , which presently deals with the majority of the german capital 's international air traffic , current plans predict that it should close its doors forever in 2010 .
but there 's a long way to go until then , and there could be some vigorous pockets of turbulence en-route . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport to close time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .

the former commissioner for eu enlargement has also been pegged to become one of five vice-presidents . the road from his past position to his new one was anything but easy for günter verheugen .
when german chancellor gerhard schröder first dropped his name in the hat to become one of the commissioners responsible for the economy , verheugen showed lttle enthusiasm .
this was in part due to his own realization that he had little in the way of experience to bring to the post .
but it was also because of the way he completely threw himself into his former role as eu enlargement commissioner .
" the way that project went , as far as my personal role was concerned , was slightly old-fashioned , with endless , long discussions with numerous contacts , and lots and lots of listening - and i can add today - also with a lot of patience that was demanded from me , " verheugen told deutsche welle . it was a historic task , one that turned verheugen into someone who earned trust throught europe as an honest broker of expansion .
while celebrating his 60th birthday in april , verheugen already had an inkling that any new duties he might be given would only be more difficult . " when your work consists of a single large , international project , and you 're not dragged into the daily struggles of politics , it 's much easier to make a positive impression , " verheugen said , reflecting on how his image benefited from the enlargement process . a passionate european in the end , the social democrat accepted his new duties .
as respected and experienced as verheugen is , he was a clear choice for the job , even if he himself is only slowly warming to the position . " i 've become such a passionate european , that i 'm only too happy to use my experiences , my contacts , my knowledge and abilities to continue to serve the european idea , " he said . the incoming president of the european commission - jose barroso - has made it clear that he wants verheugen to take a central role in forming economic policy .
verheugen 's main task will be to ensure that any new eu rules wo n't unduly handicap eu companies that have to compete with american and asian rivals .
he wo n't be a so-called " super-commissioner , " as chancellor schröder had pushed for .
that would only provoke others . popular at home verheugen 's name also regularly makes the rounds when important positions at home in berlin open up .
he enjoys the chancellor 's respect and has a colorful career on the german political stage behind him . in the very beginning of the 1980s , verheugen was secretary general of the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , before switching to the social democrats in 1982 .
he was a member of parliament , editor-in-chief of the socialist newspaper vorwärts , and a deputy minister in the foreign ministry .
he 's been in brussels since 1999 . for now though , verheugen will have to disregard gerhard schröder 's national interests .

tempelhof city airport , which was built under hitler , and tegel , which appeared on the scene in the 1970s catered to the needs of the west , whilst schönefeld , on the edge of berlin , served the east .
now the latter , which has a distinctly provincial feel to it , is on track to become a major site for both domestic and international air traffic . however , the endorsement of the project , which is worth € 1.7 billion -lrb- $ 2.07 billion -rrb- , comes with strict conditions attached .
first and foremost are the issues of minimizing sound pollution for local residents , and protecting nature and the environment around the planned site .
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. , only " quiet " aircraft will be allowed to take off or land , sound barriers will have to be erected , and , for the 10,000 trees which will be felled to clear space , 20,000 new ones will have to be planted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld currently serves several low-budget airlines matthias platzeck , state premier of brandenburg , where schönefeld is located , welcomed the decision as a " milestone in the implementation of the most important infrastructure project in the region . "
he said he expected airport to generate many new jobs and create new economic impulses in the region . groundswell of complaint the project , which has been in the workings for the past 13 years , might have cleared the first major hurdle to becoming reality , but there 's still a long way to go before building can get underway .
the ultimate decision will depend on the outcome of legal proceedings which a residents ' movement in berlin and brandenburg , bvbb , has promised to launch in opposition to the project .
ten thousand people have already lodged complaints and are prepared to go to court to fight what they consider a ridiculous decision . " no major airport has been built in such a densely populated area anywhere in the world for the past 30 years , " ferdi breidbach , chairman of bvbb , told the der spiegel newsmagazine . the class-action suit , which will be dealt at the federal constitutional court in leipzig , will take between one and two years to process , which means that even if the ruling fell in favor of the new airport , construction could n't begin until 2006 at the earliest .
in any case , that is the planned start date .
germany 's deputy transport minister tilo braune told the süddeutsche zeitung daily he is confident that building will indeed begin on schedule . out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof : what will become of the building is not yet clear regardless of the way forward for schönefeld , berlin is already poised to lose one of its three airports .
tempelhof , which sits snugly between houses in the heart of the city , will watch the last plane soar to the skies from its runway at the end of october .
constructed under hitler , the imposing building is under historical protection and , as such , will remain standing .
but as yet there 's no consensus on its future use . as for tegel , which presently deals with the majority of the german capital 's international air traffic , current plans predict that it should close its doors forever in 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 olympic games : cash cow or money pit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are pretty , but are they worth it ?
when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals . " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . " since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even . the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in 2002 dash off from the start at the olympic stadium in munich , built for the 1972 games there .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt . " if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said . olympian hangover analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsorshops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses . " it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . " massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most cities simply do not need all the facilities . even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision . not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics will bring a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's olympics logo in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy . but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out for the best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian . " they might have a nice secondary effect on the economy , " he said . " but they are n't a primary driver .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.08.2004 germany 's verheugen changes gears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's determined to rise to the challenge germany 's günter verheugen will soon take on the portfolio for enterprise and industry at the european commission .
the former commissioner for eu enlargement has also been pegged to become one of five vice-presidents . the road from his past position to his new one was anything but easy for günter verheugen .
when german chancellor gerhard schröder first dropped his name in the hat to become one of the commissioners responsible for the economy , verheugen showed lttle enthusiasm .
this was in part due to his own realization that he had little in the way of experience to bring to the post .
but it was also because of the way he completely threw himself into his former role as eu enlargement commissioner .
" the way that project went , as far as my personal role was concerned , was slightly old-fashioned , with endless , long discussions with numerous contacts , and lots and lots of listening - and i can add today - also with a lot of patience that was demanded from me , " verheugen told deutsche welle . it was a historic task , one that turned verheugen into someone who earned trust throught europe as an honest broker of expansion .
while celebrating his 60th birthday in april , verheugen already had an inkling that any new duties he might be given would only be more difficult . " when your work consists of a single large , international project , and you 're not dragged into the daily struggles of politics , it 's much easier to make a positive impression , " verheugen said , reflecting on how his image benefited from the enlargement process . a passionate european in the end , the social democrat accepted his new duties .
as respected and experienced as verheugen is , he was a clear choice for the job , even if he himself is only slowly warming to the position . " i 've become such a passionate european , that i 'm only too happy to use my experiences , my contacts , my knowledge and abilities to continue to serve the european idea , " he said . the incoming president of the european commission - jose barroso - has made it clear that he wants verheugen to take a central role in forming economic policy .
verheugen 's main task will be to ensure that any new eu rules wo n't unduly handicap eu companies that have to compete with american and asian rivals .
he wo n't be a so-called " super-commissioner , " as chancellor schröder had pushed for .
that would only provoke others . popular at home verheugen 's name also regularly makes the rounds when important positions at home in berlin open up .
he enjoys the chancellor 's respect and has a colorful career on the german political stage behind him . in the very beginning of the 1980s , verheugen was secretary general of the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , before switching to the social democrats in 1982 .
he was a member of parliament , editor-in-chief of the socialist newspaper vorwärts , and a deputy minister in the foreign ministry .
he 's been in brussels since 1999 . for now though , verheugen will have to disregard gerhard schröder 's national interests .
he 's an eu commissioner , not the agent of german industrial politics .
and that 's an experience that could prove painful for both sides . christopher plass -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 olympic games : cash cow or money pit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are pretty , but are they worth it ?
when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals . " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . " since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even . the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in 2002 dash off from the start at the olympic stadium in munich , built for the 1972 games there .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt . " if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said . olympian hangover analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsorshops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses . " it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . " massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most cities simply do not need all the facilities . even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision . not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics will bring a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's olympics logo in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy . but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out for the best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian . " they might have a nice secondary effect on the economy , " he said . " but they are n't a primary driver .

tempelhof city airport , which was built under hitler , and tegel , which appeared on the scene in the 1970s catered to the needs of the west , whilst schönefeld , on the edge of berlin , served the east .
now the latter , which has a distinctly provincial feel to it , is on track to become a major site for both domestic and international air traffic . however , the endorsement of the project , which is worth € 1.7 billion -lrb- $ 2.07 billion -rrb- , comes with strict conditions attached .
first and foremost are the issues of minimizing sound pollution for local residents , and protecting nature and the environment around the planned site .
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. , only " quiet " aircraft will be allowed to take off or land , sound barriers will have to be erected , and , for the 10,000 trees which will be felled to clear space , 20,000 new ones will have to be planted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld currently serves several low-budget airlines matthias platzeck , state premier of brandenburg , where schönefeld is located , welcomed the decision as a " milestone in the implementation of the most important infrastructure project in the region . "
he said he expected airport to generate many new jobs and create new economic impulses in the region . groundswell of complaint the project , which has been in the workings for the past 13 years , might have cleared the first major hurdle to becoming reality , but there 's still a long way to go before building can get underway .
the ultimate decision will depend on the outcome of legal proceedings which a residents ' movement in berlin and brandenburg , bvbb , has promised to launch in opposition to the project .
ten thousand people have already lodged complaints and are prepared to go to court to fight what they consider a ridiculous decision . " no major airport has been built in such a densely populated area anywhere in the world for the past 30 years , " ferdi breidbach , chairman of bvbb , told the der spiegel newsmagazine . the class-action suit , which will be dealt at the federal constitutional court in leipzig , will take between one and two years to process , which means that even if the ruling fell in favor of the new airport , construction could n't begin until 2006 at the earliest .
in any case , that is the planned start date .
germany 's deputy transport minister tilo braune told the süddeutsche zeitung daily he is confident that building will indeed begin on schedule . out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof : what will become of the building is not yet clear regardless of the way forward for schönefeld , berlin is already poised to lose one of its three airports .
tempelhof , which sits snugly between houses in the heart of the city , will watch the last plane soar to the skies from its runway at the end of october .
constructed under hitler , the imposing building is under historical protection and , as such , will remain standing .
but as yet there 's no consensus on its future use . as for tegel , which presently deals with the majority of the german capital 's international air traffic , current plans predict that it should close its doors forever in 2010 .
but there 's a long way to go until then , and there could be some vigorous pockets of turbulence en-route . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport to close time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 new berlin airport prepares for take-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld could soon become berlin 's biggest airport after years of uncertainty , berlin has been given the green light to press ahead with the expansion of its schönefeld airport in the city 's east , but opposition to the project remains strong . divided as it was for three decades , berlin needed more than one airport .
tempelhof city airport , which was built under hitler , and tegel , which appeared on the scene in the 1970s catered to the needs of the west , whilst schönefeld , on the edge of berlin , served the east .
now the latter , which has a distinctly provincial feel to it , is on track to become a major site for both domestic and international air traffic . however , the endorsement of the project , which is worth € 1.7 billion -lrb- $ 2.07 billion -rrb- , comes with strict conditions attached .
first and foremost are the issues of minimizing sound pollution for local residents , and protecting nature and the environment around the planned site .
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. , only " quiet " aircraft will be allowed to take off or land , sound barriers will have to be erected , and , for the 10,000 trees which will be felled to clear space , 20,000 new ones will have to be planted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld currently serves several low-budget airlines matthias platzeck , state premier of brandenburg , where schönefeld is located , welcomed the decision as a " milestone in the implementation of the most important infrastructure project in the region . "
he said he expected airport to generate many new jobs and create new economic impulses in the region . groundswell of complaint the project , which has been in the workings for the past 13 years , might have cleared the first major hurdle to becoming reality , but there 's still a long way to go before building can get underway .
the ultimate decision will depend on the outcome of legal proceedings which a residents ' movement in berlin and brandenburg , bvbb , has promised to launch in opposition to the project .
ten thousand people have already lodged complaints and are prepared to go to court to fight what they consider a ridiculous decision . " no major airport has been built in such a densely populated area anywhere in the world for the past 30 years , " ferdi breidbach , chairman of bvbb , told the der spiegel newsmagazine . the class-action suit , which will be dealt at the federal constitutional court in leipzig , will take between one and two years to process , which means that even if the ruling fell in favor of the new airport , construction could n't begin until 2006 at the earliest .
in any case , that is the planned start date .
germany 's deputy transport minister tilo braune told the süddeutsche zeitung daily he is confident that building will indeed begin on schedule . out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof : what will become of the building is not yet clear regardless of the way forward for schönefeld , berlin is already poised to lose one of its three airports .
tempelhof , which sits snugly between houses in the heart of the city , will watch the last plane soar to the skies from its runway at the end of october .
constructed under hitler , the imposing building is under historical protection and , as such , will remain standing .
but as yet there 's no consensus on its future use . as for tegel , which presently deals with the majority of the german capital 's international air traffic , current plans predict that it should close its doors forever in 2010 .
but there 's a long way to go until then , and there could be some vigorous pockets of turbulence en-route . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport to close time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.08.2004 german press review : schröder 's small concessions the concessions on job market reforms chancellor schröder made after street protests and the naming of new eu commissioners by incoming president jose manuel durao barroso grabbed the attention of german editorials . german papers have wildly differing opinions on the state of the so-called hartz iv job market reforms .
on the one hand , die welt from berlin loved them .
the paper said reducing social payments " is right and necessary and reasonable .
the time of having the state support people long-term is over , " the paper proclaimed .
" papa government is broke . "
the paper saw " pessimism " as " germans ' main problem . "
in die welt 's analysis , " other countries have successfully modernized their social system and job markets , " and germany can too , if it gets past its " defeatists , tacticians , and destructive criticism . "
on the other hand , neues deutschland , also from berlin , denounced the proposed reforms as the product of " ignorance , arrogance and incompetence . "
the paper wrote , " the protesters plan to continue next monday , regardless of attempts to dismiss them as populists . "
the paper then asked , what 's so populist about rejecting a proposal that - despite the chancellor 's " small concessions - continues to hurt the majority and bring a few cents more to a minority ? "
now that protesters know " pressure from the streets is effective , " they may actually be more motivated to continue next monday , the financial times deutschland from hamburg predicted .
german papers were , however , very much in agreement about the choice of german social democrat günter verheugen as the new eu industry commissioner .
chancellor gerhard schröder had called for a eu " super commissioner " for economy and competitiveness , but all the papers agreed , " verheugen will be no super commissioner . "
but they hoped he would bring a new level of german influence to the commission .
the frankfurter rundschau called the elevation of verheugen a " face-saving compromise " between the eu and schröder 's government , which pushed hard for verheugen 's appointment to a more influential economy-related post .
even as industry commissioner verheugen " will be one of the heavyweights around president barroso 's table , " the südwest presse from ulm thought .
he " made a good name for himself when he was enlargement commissioner , pushing forward european integration without losing sight of national interests , " the paper reminded readers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin tweaks reforms after protests a crisis meeting between chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics and finance ministers has resulted in some minor amendments to the government 's controversial job market reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 olympic games : cash cow or money pit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are pretty , but are they worth it ?
when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals . " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . " since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even . the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in 2002 dash off from the start at the olympic stadium in munich , built for the 1972 games there .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt . " if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said . olympian hangover analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsorshops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses . " it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . " massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most cities simply do not need all the facilities . even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision . not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics will bring a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's olympics logo in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy . but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out for the best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian . " they might have a nice secondary effect on the economy , " he said . " but they are n't a primary driver .

when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals . " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . " since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even . the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in 2002 dash off from the start at the olympic stadium in munich , built for the 1972 games there .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt . " if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said . olympian hangover analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsorshops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses . " it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . " massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most cities simply do not need all the facilities . even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision . not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics will bring a city an important or lasting economic boost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 olympic games : cash cow or money pit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are pretty , but are they worth it ?
when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals . " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . " since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even . the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in 2002 dash off from the start at the olympic stadium in munich , built for the 1972 games there .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt . " if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said . olympian hangover analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsorshops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses . " it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . " massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most cities simply do not need all the facilities . even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision . not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics will bring a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's olympics logo in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy . but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out for the best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian . " they might have a nice secondary effect on the economy , " he said . " but they are n't a primary driver .

the talks will concentrate on bulgaria 's accession to the european union . the chancellor will stay in bulgaria for almost ten hours on a visit which is seen as symbolic of his support for bilateral political relations , economic cooperation and bulgaria 's entry into the eu .
it 's only a matter of months until the eu summit , at which the date for bulgaria 's accession will be decided . last year , the mood between germany and bulgaria suffered under sofia 's promise to support us troops in the war against iraq , a war most germans openly opposed .
but during a visit to berlin in may bulgarian prime minister simeon saxe-coburg gotha and schröder sought to smooth over the rough spots in the diplomatic relationship , stressing that ties between the countries were back on a more even keel .
both german economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel have visited bulgaria since . new trade partner for germany ? the bulgarians place great importance on cooperation with their german partners .
bilateral trade relations were up by 40 percent in 2003 , and german companies have ploughed € 600 million -lrb- $ 731 million -rrb- into bulgaria in the past 12 months , making them the second largest investors there .
major german companies , including allianz , deutsche bank and metro , already have a presence on the bulgarian market .
last month , german energy giant e.on won the tender for the privatization of an electricity company in the former eastern bloc country .
daimlerchrysler is also lined up to renew the bulgarian army 's fleets , and schröder will be present in sofia as the company closes the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victoria-palace hotel , bulgaria and even if bulgaria 's importance as a trade partner for germany should wane , german holidaymakers are just beginning to discover the beauty and attraction of the country on the black sea as a vacation destination .
last year more than 500,000 germans traveled to bulgaria , and this year the figure is expected to climb to 700,000 . corruption and crime germany fully backs bulgaria 's intention to become an eu member in 2007 ; indeed , schröder has repeatedly voiced his support for the plans .
but the decision will ultimately depend on a progress report by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and the outcome of an eu summit planned for this autumn . during his visit schröder is also expected to raise issues of corruption and crime with gotha , both of which could pose hurdles to bulgaria making it into the eu .
the two leaders will also talk about the future place of turkey and countries from the western balkans in the eu .
on a more international level , observers are expecting bulgaria to react positively to the german government 's push to secure a permanent seat on the united nations security council . alexander andreev -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania 's rocky path to respectability german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting romania on thursday : the country is still struggling to meet criteria for eu accession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.08.2004 german press review : schröder 's small concessions the concessions on job market reforms chancellor schröder made after street protests and the naming of new eu commissioners by incoming president jose manuel durao barroso grabbed the attention of german editorials . german papers have wildly differing opinions on the state of the so-called hartz iv job market reforms .
on the one hand , die welt from berlin loved them .
the paper said reducing social payments " is right and necessary and reasonable .
the time of having the state support people long-term is over , " the paper proclaimed .
" papa government is broke . "
the paper saw " pessimism " as " germans ' main problem . "
in die welt 's analysis , " other countries have successfully modernized their social system and job markets , " and germany can too , if it gets past its " defeatists , tacticians , and destructive criticism . "
on the other hand , neues deutschland , also from berlin , denounced the proposed reforms as the product of " ignorance , arrogance and incompetence . "
the paper wrote , " the protesters plan to continue next monday , regardless of attempts to dismiss them as populists . "
the paper then asked , what 's so populist about rejecting a proposal that - despite the chancellor 's " small concessions - continues to hurt the majority and bring a few cents more to a minority ? "
now that protesters know " pressure from the streets is effective , " they may actually be more motivated to continue next monday , the financial times deutschland from hamburg predicted .

now the clamor to find it .
friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .
recently , the city has rushed to preserve the remains of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists .
there 's still plenty to see . the scene rarely varies .
a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " at checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so , where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
forty-three years after construction of the wall began and 15 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company berlin starting point told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest in the berlin wall , " especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century , and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the wall began in 1961 .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometer concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided its people .
however , no imagination is needed to recall the ways in which the wall had a devastating effect on the lives of east germans .
more than 75,000 people were imprisoned for trying to escape , and a total of 239 people were killed trying to get over the wall during its 28-year history .
only 5,043 managed to escape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some parts of berlin , small stones and plaques are the only remaining reminders of the city 's cold war history all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .
did you know ?
bernauerstrasse - the street that marks the boundary between the mitte district , which was part of the soviet-occupied sector , and the french-controlled wedding neighborhood - was a closed and heavily guarded border as well as the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70-meter section of the original wall and a documentation center about its history .
a short distance away , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a guard post tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmac-covered strip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topography of terror memorial in berlin peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-meter-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the topography of terror .
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of .
better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for cold war sleuths and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .

the former commissioner for eu enlargement has also been pegged to become one of five vice-presidents . the road from his past position to his new one was anything but easy for günter verheugen .
when german chancellor gerhard schröder first dropped his name in the hat to become one of the commissioners responsible for the economy , verheugen showed lttle enthusiasm .
this was in part due to his own realization that he had little in the way of experience to bring to the post .
but it was also because of the way he completely threw himself into his former role as eu enlargement commissioner .
" the way that project went , as far as my personal role was concerned , was slightly old-fashioned , with endless , long discussions with numerous contacts , and lots and lots of listening - and i can add today - also with a lot of patience that was demanded from me , " verheugen told deutsche welle . it was a historic task , one that turned verheugen into someone who earned trust throught europe as an honest broker of expansion .
while celebrating his 60th birthday in april , verheugen already had an inkling that any new duties he might be given would only be more difficult . " when your work consists of a single large , international project , and you 're not dragged into the daily struggles of politics , it 's much easier to make a positive impression , " verheugen said , reflecting on how his image benefited from the enlargement process . a passionate european in the end , the social democrat accepted his new duties .
as respected and experienced as verheugen is , he was a clear choice for the job , even if he himself is only slowly warming to the position . " i 've become such a passionate european , that i 'm only too happy to use my experiences , my contacts , my knowledge and abilities to continue to serve the european idea , " he said . the incoming president of the european commission - jose barroso - has made it clear that he wants verheugen to take a central role in forming economic policy .
verheugen 's main task will be to ensure that any new eu rules wo n't unduly handicap eu companies that have to compete with american and asian rivals .
he wo n't be a so-called " super-commissioner , " as chancellor schröder had pushed for .
that would only provoke others . popular at home verheugen 's name also regularly makes the rounds when important positions at home in berlin open up .
he enjoys the chancellor 's respect and has a colorful career on the german political stage behind him . in the very beginning of the 1980s , verheugen was secretary general of the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , before switching to the social democrats in 1982 .
he was a member of parliament , editor-in-chief of the socialist newspaper vorwärts , and a deputy minister in the foreign ministry .
he 's been in brussels since 1999 . for now though , verheugen will have to disregard gerhard schröder 's national interests .
he 's an eu commissioner , not the agent of german industrial politics .

the move came after britain on wednesday gave scientists the go ahead to clone human embryos for purposes of medical research .
british law , however , still prohibits the actual cloning of humans .
leading the charge , the german medical association called for the complete prohibition of all forms of embryo cloning .
" we ca n't allow embryos to be harvested like raw materials , " association president jörg-dietrich hoppe told reporters .
other medical experts concurred .
" the indivisibility of human rights are being eroded under the blanket of research freedom , " said frank ulrich montgomery , chairman of the marburger association of doctors .

the social democrats ' junior coalition partner , the greens , have also called for the international community to forbid cloning .
" it 's up the german politicians to work towards holding together the nations that have spoken out against cloning , " christa nickels , a leading green and chairwoman of the bundestag 's human rights committee , told public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .

the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , called for the imposition of a cloning ban and criticized britain 's move as " unacceptable . " maria böhmer , deputy chair of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said that by allowing cloning " the human being is degraded to a material .
it 's an extremely alarming and disastrous development for europe . "
not a single one of germany 's three biggest parties supports the lifting of the current ban - even for medical research . nickels of the greens noted that enormous progress has been made in conventional treatment of a number of diseases .

tempelhof city airport , which was built under hitler , and tegel , which appeared on the scene in the 1970s catered to the needs of the west , whilst schönefeld , on the edge of berlin , served the east .
now the latter , which has a distinctly provincial feel to it , is on track to become a major site for both domestic and international air traffic . however , the endorsement of the project , which is worth € 1.7 billion -lrb- $ 2.07 billion -rrb- , comes with strict conditions attached .
first and foremost are the issues of minimizing sound pollution for local residents , and protecting nature and the environment around the planned site .
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. , only " quiet " aircraft will be allowed to take off or land , sound barriers will have to be erected , and , for the 10,000 trees which will be felled to clear space , 20,000 new ones will have to be planted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld currently serves several low-budget airlines matthias platzeck , state premier of brandenburg , where schönefeld is located , welcomed the decision as a " milestone in the implementation of the most important infrastructure project in the region . "
he said he expected airport to generate many new jobs and create new economic impulses in the region . groundswell of complaint the project , which has been in the workings for the past 13 years , might have cleared the first major hurdle to becoming reality , but there 's still a long way to go before building can get underway .
the ultimate decision will depend on the outcome of legal proceedings which a residents ' movement in berlin and brandenburg , bvbb , has promised to launch in opposition to the project .
ten thousand people have already lodged complaints and are prepared to go to court to fight what they consider a ridiculous decision . " no major airport has been built in such a densely populated area anywhere in the world for the past 30 years , " ferdi breidbach , chairman of bvbb , told the der spiegel newsmagazine . the class-action suit , which will be dealt at the federal constitutional court in leipzig , will take between one and two years to process , which means that even if the ruling fell in favor of the new airport , construction could n't begin until 2006 at the earliest .
in any case , that is the planned start date .
germany 's deputy transport minister tilo braune told the süddeutsche zeitung daily he is confident that building will indeed begin on schedule . out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof : what will become of the building is not yet clear regardless of the way forward for schönefeld , berlin is already poised to lose one of its three airports .
tempelhof , which sits snugly between houses in the heart of the city , will watch the last plane soar to the skies from its runway at the end of october .
constructed under hitler , the imposing building is under historical protection and , as such , will remain standing .
but as yet there 's no consensus on its future use . as for tegel , which presently deals with the majority of the german capital 's international air traffic , current plans predict that it should close its doors forever in 2010 .

the former commissioner for eu enlargement has also been pegged to become one of five vice-presidents . the road from his past position to his new one was anything but easy for günter verheugen .
when german chancellor gerhard schröder first dropped his name in the hat to become one of the commissioners responsible for the economy , verheugen showed lttle enthusiasm .
this was in part due to his own realization that he had little in the way of experience to bring to the post .
but it was also because of the way he completely threw himself into his former role as eu enlargement commissioner .
" the way that project went , as far as my personal role was concerned , was slightly old-fashioned , with endless , long discussions with numerous contacts , and lots and lots of listening - and i can add today - also with a lot of patience that was demanded from me , " verheugen told deutsche welle . it was a historic task , one that turned verheugen into someone who earned trust throught europe as an honest broker of expansion .

verheugen 's main task will be to ensure that any new eu rules wo n't unduly handicap eu companies that have to compete with american and asian rivals .
he wo n't be a so-called " super-commissioner , " as chancellor schröder had pushed for .
that would only provoke others . popular at home verheugen 's name also regularly makes the rounds when important positions at home in berlin open up .
he enjoys the chancellor 's respect and has a colorful career on the german political stage behind him . in the very beginning of the 1980s , verheugen was secretary general of the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , before switching to the social democrats in 1982 .
he was a member of parliament , editor-in-chief of the socialist newspaper vorwärts , and a deputy minister in the foreign ministry .
he 's been in brussels since 1999 . for now though , verheugen will have to disregard gerhard schröder 's national interests .

" i 've become such a passionate european , that i 'm only too happy to use my experiences , my contacts , my knowledge and abilities to continue to serve the european idea , " he said . the incoming president of the european commission - jose barroso - has made it clear that he wants verheugen to take a central role in forming economic policy .
verheugen 's main task will be to ensure that any new eu rules wo n't unduly handicap eu companies that have to compete with american and asian rivals .
he wo n't be a so-called " super-commissioner , " as chancellor schröder had pushed for .
that would only provoke others . popular at home verheugen 's name also regularly makes the rounds when important positions at home in berlin open up .
he enjoys the chancellor 's respect and has a colorful career on the german political stage behind him . in the very beginning of the 1980s , verheugen was secretary general of the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , before switching to the social democrats in 1982 .
he was a member of parliament , editor-in-chief of the socialist newspaper vorwärts , and a deputy minister in the foreign ministry .
he 's been in brussels since 1999 . for now though , verheugen will have to disregard gerhard schröder 's national interests .
he 's an eu commissioner , not the agent of german industrial politics .
and that 's an experience that could prove painful for both sides . christopher plass -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

on thursday he called for the immediate closure of the seminary stating that his investigation had uncovered " very painful " revelations of sexual misconduct . " a new beginning is necessary .
i am closing the seminary right away , " küng told reporters . the emissary did not go into detail about what his probe had revealed , but did say that some of the would-be priests had " obsessively " downloaded pornographic images from the internet .
he added that the selection criteria for young men entering the seminary had been lax , and that they would now introduce a screening process for both new and existing students in order to secure a fresh start .
but not everyone will be allowed to return to the seminary .
" those who do not seem suited for priesthood , will be helped to find a new professional direction , " küng told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roman catholic seminary in the diocese of st. poelten he was also keen to stress that the closure was just a temporary measure , but did not offer a time-scale for the re-opening of the baroque seminary , which has been training young men for the priesthood for more than 200 years . growing storm austrian authorities first came across pornographic images at the seminary at the end of last year .
since when they have found 40,000 images and videos , including child pornography .
but it was only after the publication of some pictures showing sexual relations between priesthood students and their teachers in an austrian magazine that pope john paul ii sent küng as an " apostolic visitor " to diffuse the growing scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian bishop kurt krenn refuses to quit his post as head of the st. poelten diocese the vatican has already disempowered the bishop of the st. pölten diocese , kurt krenn , in connection with the scandal .
but krenn , who played down the scandal - referring to the photos of priests kissing and fondling as " childish pranks " - has refused to step down . on friday a former seminary student from poland was convicted of possessing child pornography , and given a 6-month suspended sentence . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sinners in priests ' clothing sexual abuse allegations of minors by clerics surface regularly .

on thursday he called for the immediate closure of the seminary stating that his investigation had uncovered " very painful " revelations of sexual misconduct . " a new beginning is necessary .
i am closing the seminary right away , " küng told reporters . the emissary did not go into detail about what his probe had revealed , but did say that some of the would-be priests had " obsessively " downloaded pornographic images from the internet .
he added that the selection criteria for young men entering the seminary had been lax , and that they would now introduce a screening process for both new and existing students in order to secure a fresh start .
but not everyone will be allowed to return to the seminary .
" those who do not seem suited for priesthood , will be helped to find a new professional direction , " küng told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roman catholic seminary in the diocese of st. poelten he was also keen to stress that the closure was just a temporary measure , but did not offer a time-scale for the re-opening of the baroque seminary , which has been training young men for the priesthood for more than 200 years . growing storm austrian authorities first came across pornographic images at the seminary at the end of last year .
since when they have found 40,000 images and videos , including child pornography .
but it was only after the publication of some pictures showing sexual relations between priesthood students and their teachers in an austrian magazine that pope john paul ii sent küng as an " apostolic visitor " to diffuse the growing scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian bishop kurt krenn refuses to quit his post as head of the st. poelten diocese the vatican has already disempowered the bishop of the st. pölten diocese , kurt krenn , in connection with the scandal .

so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company berlin starting point told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest in the berlin wall , " especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century , and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .

however , no imagination is needed to recall the ways in which the wall had a devastating effect on the lives of east germans .

on the one hand , die welt from berlin loved them .
the paper said reducing social payments " is right and necessary and reasonable .
the time of having the state support people long-term is over , " the paper proclaimed .
" papa government is broke . "
the paper saw " pessimism " as " germans ' main problem . "
in die welt 's analysis , " other countries have successfully modernized their social system and job markets , " and germany can too , if it gets past its " defeatists , tacticians , and destructive criticism . "
on the other hand , neues deutschland , also from berlin , denounced the proposed reforms as the product of " ignorance , arrogance and incompetence . "
the paper wrote , " the protesters plan to continue next monday , regardless of attempts to dismiss them as populists . "
the paper then asked , what 's so populist about rejecting a proposal that - despite the chancellor 's " small concessions - continues to hurt the majority and bring a few cents more to a minority ? "
now that protesters know " pressure from the streets is effective , " they may actually be more motivated to continue next monday , the financial times deutschland from hamburg predicted .
german papers were , however , very much in agreement about the choice of german social democrat günter verheugen as the new eu industry commissioner .
chancellor gerhard schröder had called for a eu " super commissioner " for economy and competitiveness , but all the papers agreed , " verheugen will be no super commissioner . "
but they hoped he would bring a new level of german influence to the commission .
the frankfurter rundschau called the elevation of verheugen a " face-saving compromise " between the eu and schröder 's government , which pushed hard for verheugen 's appointment to a more influential economy-related post .
even as industry commissioner verheugen " will be one of the heavyweights around president barroso 's table , " the südwest presse from ulm thought .
he " made a good name for himself when he was enlargement commissioner , pushing forward european integration without losing sight of national interests , " the paper reminded readers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin tweaks reforms after protests a crisis meeting between chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics and finance ministers has resulted in some minor amendments to the government 's controversial job market reforms .

the talks will concentrate on bulgaria 's accession to the european union . the chancellor will stay in bulgaria for almost ten hours on a visit which is seen as symbolic of his support for bilateral political relations , economic cooperation and bulgaria 's entry into the eu .
it 's only a matter of months until the eu summit , at which the date for bulgaria 's accession will be decided . last year , the mood between germany and bulgaria suffered under sofia 's promise to support us troops in the war against iraq , a war most germans openly opposed .
but during a visit to berlin in may bulgarian prime minister simeon saxe-coburg gotha and schröder sought to smooth over the rough spots in the diplomatic relationship , stressing that ties between the countries were back on a more even keel .
both german economics minister wolfgang clement and finance minister hans eichel have visited bulgaria since . new trade partner for germany ? the bulgarians place great importance on cooperation with their german partners .
bilateral trade relations were up by 40 percent in 2003 , and german companies have ploughed € 600 million -lrb- $ 731 million -rrb- into bulgaria in the past 12 months , making them the second largest investors there .
major german companies , including allianz , deutsche bank and metro , already have a presence on the bulgarian market .
last month , german energy giant e.on won the tender for the privatization of an electricity company in the former eastern bloc country .
daimlerchrysler is also lined up to renew the bulgarian army 's fleets , and schröder will be present in sofia as the company closes the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victoria-palace hotel , bulgaria and even if bulgaria 's importance as a trade partner for germany should wane , german holidaymakers are just beginning to discover the beauty and attraction of the country on the black sea as a vacation destination .
last year more than 500,000 germans traveled to bulgaria , and this year the figure is expected to climb to 700,000 . corruption and crime germany fully backs bulgaria 's intention to become an eu member in 2007 ; indeed , schröder has repeatedly voiced his support for the plans .
but the decision will ultimately depend on a progress report by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and the outcome of an eu summit planned for this autumn . during his visit schröder is also expected to raise issues of corruption and crime with gotha , both of which could pose hurdles to bulgaria making it into the eu .
the two leaders will also talk about the future place of turkey and countries from the western balkans in the eu .
on a more international level , observers are expecting bulgaria to react positively to the german government 's push to secure a permanent seat on the united nations security council . alexander andreev -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania 's rocky path to respectability german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting romania on thursday : the country is still struggling to meet criteria for eu accession .

on thursday he called for the immediate closure of the seminary stating that his investigation had uncovered " very painful " revelations of sexual misconduct . " a new beginning is necessary .
i am closing the seminary right away , " küng told reporters . the emissary did not go into detail about what his probe had revealed , but did say that some of the would-be priests had " obsessively " downloaded pornographic images from the internet .
he added that the selection criteria for young men entering the seminary had been lax , and that they would now introduce a screening process for both new and existing students in order to secure a fresh start .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 new berlin airport prepares for take-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld could soon become berlin 's biggest airport after years of uncertainty , berlin has been given the green light to press ahead with the expansion of its schönefeld airport in the city 's east , but opposition to the project remains strong . divided as it was for three decades , berlin needed more than one airport .
tempelhof city airport , which was built under hitler , and tegel , which appeared on the scene in the 1970s catered to the needs of the west , whilst schönefeld , on the edge of berlin , served the east .
now the latter , which has a distinctly provincial feel to it , is on track to become a major site for both domestic and international air traffic . however , the endorsement of the project , which is worth € 1.7 billion -lrb- $ 2.07 billion -rrb- , comes with strict conditions attached .
first and foremost are the issues of minimizing sound pollution for local residents , and protecting nature and the environment around the planned site .
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. , only " quiet " aircraft will be allowed to take off or land , sound barriers will have to be erected , and , for the 10,000 trees which will be felled to clear space , 20,000 new ones will have to be planted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld currently serves several low-budget airlines matthias platzeck , state premier of brandenburg , where schönefeld is located , welcomed the decision as a " milestone in the implementation of the most important infrastructure project in the region . "
he said he expected airport to generate many new jobs and create new economic impulses in the region . groundswell of complaint the project , which has been in the workings for the past 13 years , might have cleared the first major hurdle to becoming reality , but there 's still a long way to go before building can get underway .
the ultimate decision will depend on the outcome of legal proceedings which a residents ' movement in berlin and brandenburg , bvbb , has promised to launch in opposition to the project .
ten thousand people have already lodged complaints and are prepared to go to court to fight what they consider a ridiculous decision . " no major airport has been built in such a densely populated area anywhere in the world for the past 30 years , " ferdi breidbach , chairman of bvbb , told the der spiegel newsmagazine . the class-action suit , which will be dealt at the federal constitutional court in leipzig , will take between one and two years to process , which means that even if the ruling fell in favor of the new airport , construction could n't begin until 2006 at the earliest .
in any case , that is the planned start date .
germany 's deputy transport minister tilo braune told the süddeutsche zeitung daily he is confident that building will indeed begin on schedule . out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof : what will become of the building is not yet clear regardless of the way forward for schönefeld , berlin is already poised to lose one of its three airports .
tempelhof , which sits snugly between houses in the heart of the city , will watch the last plane soar to the skies from its runway at the end of october .
constructed under hitler , the imposing building is under historical protection and , as such , will remain standing .
but as yet there 's no consensus on its future use . as for tegel , which presently deals with the majority of the german capital 's international air traffic , current plans predict that it should close its doors forever in 2010 .
but there 's a long way to go until then , and there could be some vigorous pockets of turbulence en-route . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport to close time and financial difficulties have eventually caught up with berlin 's legendary tempelhof airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 olympic games : cash cow or money pit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are pretty , but are they worth it ?
when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .

those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .

when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.08.2004 germany 's verheugen changes gears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's determined to rise to the challenge germany 's günter verheugen will soon take on the portfolio for enterprise and industry at the european commission .
the former commissioner for eu enlargement has also been pegged to become one of five vice-presidents . the road from his past position to his new one was anything but easy for günter verheugen .
when german chancellor gerhard schröder first dropped his name in the hat to become one of the commissioners responsible for the economy , verheugen showed lttle enthusiasm .
this was in part due to his own realization that he had little in the way of experience to bring to the post .
but it was also because of the way he completely threw himself into his former role as eu enlargement commissioner .
" the way that project went , as far as my personal role was concerned , was slightly old-fashioned , with endless , long discussions with numerous contacts , and lots and lots of listening - and i can add today - also with a lot of patience that was demanded from me , " verheugen told deutsche welle . it was a historic task , one that turned verheugen into someone who earned trust throught europe as an honest broker of expansion .
while celebrating his 60th birthday in april , verheugen already had an inkling that any new duties he might be given would only be more difficult . " when your work consists of a single large , international project , and you 're not dragged into the daily struggles of politics , it 's much easier to make a positive impression , " verheugen said , reflecting on how his image benefited from the enlargement process . a passionate european in the end , the social democrat accepted his new duties .
as respected and experienced as verheugen is , he was a clear choice for the job , even if he himself is only slowly warming to the position . " i 've become such a passionate european , that i 'm only too happy to use my experiences , my contacts , my knowledge and abilities to continue to serve the european idea , " he said . the incoming president of the european commission - jose barroso - has made it clear that he wants verheugen to take a central role in forming economic policy .
verheugen 's main task will be to ensure that any new eu rules wo n't unduly handicap eu companies that have to compete with american and asian rivals .
he wo n't be a so-called " super-commissioner , " as chancellor schröder had pushed for .
that would only provoke others . popular at home verheugen 's name also regularly makes the rounds when important positions at home in berlin open up .
he enjoys the chancellor 's respect and has a colorful career on the german political stage behind him . in the very beginning of the 1980s , verheugen was secretary general of the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , before switching to the social democrats in 1982 .
he was a member of parliament , editor-in-chief of the socialist newspaper vorwärts , and a deputy minister in the foreign ministry .
he 's been in brussels since 1999 . for now though , verheugen will have to disregard gerhard schröder 's national interests .
he 's an eu commissioner , not the agent of german industrial politics .
and that 's an experience that could prove painful for both sides . christopher plass -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .
-lrb- august 12 , 2004 -rrb- new eu commission takes shape barroso 's team of eu executives is finally complete .

when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals . " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . " since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even . the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in 2002 dash off from the start at the olympic stadium in munich , built for the 1972 games there .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt . " if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said . olympian hangover analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsorshops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses . " it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . " massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most cities simply do not need all the facilities . even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision . not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics will bring a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's olympics logo in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy . but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out for the best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian . " they might have a nice secondary effect on the economy , " he said . " but they are n't a primary driver .

now the clamor to find it .
friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .
recently , the city has rushed to preserve the remains of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists .
there 's still plenty to see . the scene rarely varies .
a busload of tourists with cameras slung around their necks are emptied near the famous " wall museum " at checkpoint charlie in east berlin .
amid the excited babble of voices and whirring of cameras , the question " so , where is the wall ? " is bound to be heard .
forty-three years after construction of the wall began and 15 years after it was hacked and demolished to roars of hearty approval , nothing appears more fascinating to visitors to berlin than to see for themselves the wall that once sliced the city .
so , where 's the wall ?
peter wess of the city sightseeing company berlin starting point told dw-world that " there ’ s a huge interest in the berlin wall , " especially among tourists from english-speaking countries and in particular the americans .
" they aren ’ t too interested in prussian history , but rather german history of the 20th century , and the wall is one of the most important themes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the wall began in 1961 .
but tourists to berlin need to have a good imagination to try and visually reconstruct the 43.1 kilometer concrete structure that once ran through the german capital and divided its people .
however , no imagination is needed to recall the ways in which the wall had a devastating effect on the lives of east germans .
more than 75,000 people were imprisoned for trying to escape , and a total of 239 people were killed trying to get over the wall during its 28-year history .
only 5,043 managed to escape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some parts of berlin , small stones and plaques are the only remaining reminders of the city 's cold war history all that ’ s visible today is a double row of cobblestones in some parts of downtown berlin to mark the original route of the wall , a few memorials and plaques and truncated scraps of graffiti-splattered wall .
did you know ?
bernauerstrasse - the street that marks the boundary between the mitte district , which was part of the soviet-occupied sector , and the french-controlled wedding neighborhood - was a closed and heavily guarded border as well as the scene of several escape attempts from the east to the west .
today it houses the memorial of division , which includes a 70-meter section of the original wall and a documentation center about its history .
a short distance away , the invalidenfriedhof cemetery also houses some stretches of the wall as well as a guard post tower .
a large number of graves in the cemetery were moved during the cold war to make way for watchtowers and a tarmac-covered strip .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the topography of terror memorial in berlin peter wess says that another important part of the original berlin wall is the 200-meter-long stretch in the niederkirchnerstrasse that once marked the border between the eastern district of mitte and the western district of kreuzberg .
this bit of the wall has now been preserved as the northern-most tip of an exhibition at the site of the former gestapo headquarters called the topography of terror .
both wall and exhibition serve to document the inhumanity mankind is capable of .
better known remnants of the wall a popular destination for cold war sleuths and one that finds mention in every available city guide on berlin is the checkpoint charlie museum on friedrichstrasse .

to the west of the museum lies the east side gallery in the mühlenstrasse , the largest surviving chunk of the wall .
it is a full 1,300 meters long and also a massive open-air art gallery .

tempelhof city airport , which was built under hitler , and tegel , which appeared on the scene in the 1970s catered to the needs of the west , whilst schönefeld , on the edge of berlin , served the east .
now the latter , which has a distinctly provincial feel to it , is on track to become a major site for both domestic and international air traffic . however , the endorsement of the project , which is worth € 1.7 billion -lrb- $ 2.07 billion -rrb- , comes with strict conditions attached .
first and foremost are the issues of minimizing sound pollution for local residents , and protecting nature and the environment around the planned site .
between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. , only " quiet " aircraft will be allowed to take off or land , sound barriers will have to be erected , and , for the 10,000 trees which will be felled to clear space , 20,000 new ones will have to be planted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schönefeld currently serves several low-budget airlines matthias platzeck , state premier of brandenburg , where schönefeld is located , welcomed the decision as a " milestone in the implementation of the most important infrastructure project in the region . "
he said he expected airport to generate many new jobs and create new economic impulses in the region . groundswell of complaint the project , which has been in the workings for the past 13 years , might have cleared the first major hurdle to becoming reality , but there 's still a long way to go before building can get underway .
the ultimate decision will depend on the outcome of legal proceedings which a residents ' movement in berlin and brandenburg , bvbb , has promised to launch in opposition to the project .
ten thousand people have already lodged complaints and are prepared to go to court to fight what they consider a ridiculous decision . " no major airport has been built in such a densely populated area anywhere in the world for the past 30 years , " ferdi breidbach , chairman of bvbb , told the der spiegel newsmagazine . the class-action suit , which will be dealt at the federal constitutional court in leipzig , will take between one and two years to process , which means that even if the ruling fell in favor of the new airport , construction could n't begin until 2006 at the earliest .
in any case , that is the planned start date .
germany 's deputy transport minister tilo braune told the süddeutsche zeitung daily he is confident that building will indeed begin on schedule . out with the old bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof : what will become of the building is not yet clear regardless of the way forward for schönefeld , berlin is already poised to lose one of its three airports .
tempelhof , which sits snugly between houses in the heart of the city , will watch the last plane soar to the skies from its runway at the end of october .
constructed under hitler , the imposing building is under historical protection and , as such , will remain standing .
but as yet there 's no consensus on its future use . as for tegel , which presently deals with the majority of the german capital 's international air traffic , current plans predict that it should close its doors forever in 2010 .

the move came after britain on wednesday gave scientists the go ahead to clone human embryos for purposes of medical research .
british law , however , still prohibits the actual cloning of humans .
leading the charge , the german medical association called for the complete prohibition of all forms of embryo cloning .
" we ca n't allow embryos to be harvested like raw materials , " association president jörg-dietrich hoppe told reporters .
other medical experts concurred .
" the indivisibility of human rights are being eroded under the blanket of research freedom , " said frank ulrich montgomery , chairman of the marburger association of doctors .
he also called for a europe-wide law protecting embryos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a microscopic view of human embryos most politicians united wolfgang wodarg - a member of the ruling social democratic party and chairman off the bio-ethics commission in the bundestag , germany 's parliament - called britain 's decision a " catastrophe . "
the social democrats ' junior coalition partner , the greens , have also called for the international community to forbid cloning .
" it 's up the german politicians to work towards holding together the nations that have spoken out against cloning , " christa nickels , a leading green and chairwoman of the bundestag 's human rights committee , told public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
a cloning ban also found resonance with germany 's conservative opposition .
the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , called for the imposition of a cloning ban and criticized britain 's move as " unacceptable . " maria böhmer , deputy chair of the cdu 's parliamentary group , said that by allowing cloning " the human being is degraded to a material .
it 's an extremely alarming and disastrous development for europe . "
not a single one of germany 's three biggest parties supports the lifting of the current ban - even for medical research . nickels of the greens noted that enormous progress has been made in conventional treatment of a number of diseases .
citing diabetes as an example , nickels said the disease could be effectively and inexpensively fought using preventative measures like nutrition programs for children .
discord prevails bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : science has come a long way since dolly was cloned in 1996 however , the move by the british found support in at least one mainstream german political quarter .
the neo-liberal free democrat party called the move to allowing human embryo cloning a " logical step , " since cloned animal cells have been used in britain since 2001 without breaking any taboos .
it would be irresponsible to promote the " patient tourism , " which would result if one country developed therapies unavailable in others , just so germany " can stay in its own ivory castle , " said ulrike flach , an fdp member and chairwoman of the bundestag 's research committee .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.08.2004 germany 's verheugen changes gears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's determined to rise to the challenge germany 's günter verheugen will soon take on the portfolio for enterprise and industry at the european commission .
the former commissioner for eu enlargement has also been pegged to become one of five vice-presidents . the road from his past position to his new one was anything but easy for günter verheugen .
when german chancellor gerhard schröder first dropped his name in the hat to become one of the commissioners responsible for the economy , verheugen showed lttle enthusiasm .
this was in part due to his own realization that he had little in the way of experience to bring to the post .
but it was also because of the way he completely threw himself into his former role as eu enlargement commissioner .
" the way that project went , as far as my personal role was concerned , was slightly old-fashioned , with endless , long discussions with numerous contacts , and lots and lots of listening - and i can add today - also with a lot of patience that was demanded from me , " verheugen told deutsche welle . it was a historic task , one that turned verheugen into someone who earned trust throught europe as an honest broker of expansion .
while celebrating his 60th birthday in april , verheugen already had an inkling that any new duties he might be given would only be more difficult . " when your work consists of a single large , international project , and you 're not dragged into the daily struggles of politics , it 's much easier to make a positive impression , " verheugen said , reflecting on how his image benefited from the enlargement process . a passionate european in the end , the social democrat accepted his new duties .
as respected and experienced as verheugen is , he was a clear choice for the job , even if he himself is only slowly warming to the position . " i 've become such a passionate european , that i 'm only too happy to use my experiences , my contacts , my knowledge and abilities to continue to serve the european idea , " he said . the incoming president of the european commission - jose barroso - has made it clear that he wants verheugen to take a central role in forming economic policy .
verheugen 's main task will be to ensure that any new eu rules wo n't unduly handicap eu companies that have to compete with american and asian rivals .
he wo n't be a so-called " super-commissioner , " as chancellor schröder had pushed for .
that would only provoke others . popular at home verheugen 's name also regularly makes the rounds when important positions at home in berlin open up .
he enjoys the chancellor 's respect and has a colorful career on the german political stage behind him . in the very beginning of the 1980s , verheugen was secretary general of the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , before switching to the social democrats in 1982 .
he was a member of parliament , editor-in-chief of the socialist newspaper vorwärts , and a deputy minister in the foreign ministry .
he 's been in brussels since 1999 . for now though , verheugen will have to disregard gerhard schröder 's national interests .
he 's an eu commissioner , not the agent of german industrial politics .
and that 's an experience that could prove painful for both sides . christopher plass -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .
-lrb- august 12 , 2004 -rrb- new eu commission takes shape barroso 's team of eu executives is finally complete .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.08.2004 olympic games : cash cow or money pit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics are pretty , but are they worth it ?
when bids are requested from cities to host future olympic games , there is never a shortage of municipalities vying to welcome the world 's athletes .
the games bring prestige , but do they bring financial benefits as well ? no one doubts the fact that hosting the olympic games allows a city to bathe in the focused spotlight of world attention for two weeks , or longer if the build-up is included .
less certain , however , is whether all that attention and elevated stature is matched by an equivalent economic boost for the region or even the country , or if in many cases the olympics bring lots of cachet , but little cash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swimmer dives in the olympic natatorium in athens .
one thing is clear , in the often heady - and sometimes panicked - days preparing for the games and then watching athletes run , jump , swim and perform feats seemingly beyond the abilities of mere mortals , the financial consequences of all that work and capital put into hosting the event appear worth it . " there are direct economic advantages to the olympics while the games are on , " wolfgang czepiczka , a sports economist on the board of germany 's association of sports economy and sports management , told dw-world . " tax receipts go up , visitor numbers rise and then there is the simple fact that cities get to show themselves off . " but whether those benefits continue after the athletes have packed up their medals and tourists have packed their bags is less certain .
the olympics ' financial record is mixed . financial tragedy and triumph bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction crews work at a metro extension worksite at vouliagmenis avenue in athens , which is getting a face-lift thanks to the 2004 games .
one thing that everyone can agree on is that hosting the olympics costs a lot and it 's getting more expensive all the time .
for the games in greece , operating costs have soared from € 500 million to € 2 billion -lrb- $ 611 million to $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
the total cost of olympic spending is estimated to approach € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- . however , there was little research into the wider economic impact of the olympics until montreal emerged from the 1976 games with a gaping deficit of $ 1.2 billion -lrb- € 1 billion -rrb- , an amount local residents are still paying off through a supplementary tax on tobacco .
those games were funded almost entirely through public city funds , and the large amounts of money spent on infrastructure improvements and facilities construction were focused on a relatively small part of the city .
montreal 1976 is widely held up as the example not to follow , and it caused many cities to think twice about bidding for future games . the first olympics to turn a profit were the summer games held in los angeles in 1984 .
since local citizens voted against public financing , those games also became the first to be almost entirely privately funded .
los angeles marked the beginnings of commercialization of the games and the development of olympic sponsorship deals . " in 1984 , organizational and economic strategies were introduced which meant the city could hold magnificent games that would n't bankrupt the city , " martin-peter büch , an economist at the german sport university in cologne , told dw-world in an interview .
" 1984 showed that it was actually worthwhile to hold an olympics . " since then , the summer olympics have made money or at least broken even , according to a report by pricewaterhousecoopers .
seoul in 1988 was left with a positive balance of $ 556 million , atlanta in 1996 and sydney in 2000 each broke even . the 1992 games in barcelona only came out around $ 3 million ahead , but are held up as a good example of secondary benefits that a financially viable olympics can bring to a city or region .
the spanish city got a massive makeover for the games : its transportation and telecommunications systems were upgraded , it got new housing and retail centers that are still flourishing 12 years later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in 2002 dash off from the start at the olympic stadium in munich , built for the 1972 games there .
germany 's 1972 munich games were similar , according to wolfgang czepiczka .
although it emerged with a deficit , after the games munich had a new subway system and much of the city had been renovated and rebuilt . " if done the right way , the games can bring a city many long-term benefits , as they did in munich , " he said . olympian hangover analysts break up olympics economics for a city into three phases : pre-game , game and post-game .
during the first phase , the city can benefit from tourism and a boost in construction activity .
during the games , there are olympic jobs to be had , revenues from tickets , sponsorshops , etc , not to mention the masses of tourists that descend on hotels , restaurants and other local businesses . " it 's when it 's all over that the problems come , " markus kurscheidt , a sports scientist at the ruhr university of bochum , told dw-world .
" the challenge is to use all that infrastructure effectively and learn how to deal with the massive , sudden drop-off . " massive olympic sports arenas often remain un- or underused .
olympic villages fall into disrepair and become headaches for the city .
most cities simply do not need all the facilities . even sydney - which many australians tout as an economic success story - has had day-after problems .
it 's huge olympic park stands mostly silent and empty , too big to be sustained by regular sporting events alone .
it will require an investment of at least € 15 million to turn it into the " living precinct " its designers envision . not an economic driver analysts say the evidence is just not clear on whether hosting the olympics will bring a city an important or lasting economic boost .
thanks to new funding strategies and revenue sources , the dark high-deficit days of montreal will most likely remain in the past .
but whether the boost gained by temporary job creation and intense publicity is long-lasting is more difficult to ascertain , say experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's olympics logo in may , the german city of leipzig , population 500,000 , was eliminated from the running to host the 2012 games .
while the medium-sized city showed spunk it is race for gold , it could not meet the infrastructure requirements of the international olympic committee .
german officials at the local and federal level were disappointed , since they had hoped that an olympics in leipzig could bring a powerful boost to the ailing eastern german economy . but sports economist kurscheidt warns against such an approach , saying things probably turned out for the best for leipzig .
he says the olympics ' powers of economic rejuvenation are n't exactly olympian . " they might have a nice secondary effect on the economy , " he said . " but they are n't a primary driver .

the former commissioner for eu enlargement has also been pegged to become one of five vice-presidents . the road from his past position to his new one was anything but easy for günter verheugen .
when german chancellor gerhard schröder first dropped his name in the hat to become one of the commissioners responsible for the economy , verheugen showed lttle enthusiasm .
this was in part due to his own realization that he had little in the way of experience to bring to the post .
but it was also because of the way he completely threw himself into his former role as eu enlargement commissioner .
" the way that project went , as far as my personal role was concerned , was slightly old-fashioned , with endless , long discussions with numerous contacts , and lots and lots of listening - and i can add today - also with a lot of patience that was demanded from me , " verheugen told deutsche welle . it was a historic task , one that turned verheugen into someone who earned trust throught europe as an honest broker of expansion .
while celebrating his 60th birthday in april , verheugen already had an inkling that any new duties he might be given would only be more difficult . " when your work consists of a single large , international project , and you 're not dragged into the daily struggles of politics , it 's much easier to make a positive impression , " verheugen said , reflecting on how his image benefited from the enlargement process . a passionate european in the end , the social democrat accepted his new duties .
as respected and experienced as verheugen is , he was a clear choice for the job , even if he himself is only slowly warming to the position . " i 've become such a passionate european , that i 'm only too happy to use my experiences , my contacts , my knowledge and abilities to continue to serve the european idea , " he said . the incoming president of the european commission - jose barroso - has made it clear that he wants verheugen to take a central role in forming economic policy .
verheugen 's main task will be to ensure that any new eu rules wo n't unduly handicap eu companies that have to compete with american and asian rivals .
he wo n't be a so-called " super-commissioner , " as chancellor schröder had pushed for .
that would only provoke others . popular at home verheugen 's name also regularly makes the rounds when important positions at home in berlin open up .
he enjoys the chancellor 's respect and has a colorful career on the german political stage behind him . in the very beginning of the 1980s , verheugen was secretary general of the liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , before switching to the social democrats in 1982 .
he was a member of parliament , editor-in-chief of the socialist newspaper vorwärts , and a deputy minister in the foreign ministry .
he 's been in brussels since 1999 . for now though , verheugen will have to disregard gerhard schröder 's national interests .
he 's an eu commissioner , not the agent of german industrial politics .
and that 's an experience that could prove painful for both sides . christopher plass -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso hands out new eu commission posts european commission president-elect jose manuel durao barroso announced his new line-up of 24 commissioners thursday , giving big and small countries influential positions .

but it was also because of the way he completely threw himself into his former role as eu enlargement commissioner .

dw-world readers side with the nudists . i would not feel the slightest bit uncomfortable sharing the beach with nudists .
i only wish that we were advanced enough here in pennsylvania to be even having this debate ! - dan russo it would not bother me at all to be on a beach with nudists .
i 'm suprised by this article .
i always thought that the german people were comfortable with nudity . - brent donohoe sadly , i ’ ve read that there is an effort to restrict some areas of nude bathing in germany .
personally i feel this is a mistake .
living in a country that deems public nudity as a crime , i can only hope that the german people do not allow this attitude to befall them .
since my first visit to a nude beach , i have found that being unclothed is not only most relaxing but a natural feeling as well .
my family and i will continue to travel to germany during our summer vacations and will visit the nude beaches .
i am a tourist and i am in favor of keeping the nude beaches free and open .
this is one tourist who goes to germany for the nude beaches .
it ’ s time to ask the tourist industry how much money will they lose if the fkk -lrb- nudist -rrb- beaches are closed . - wayne stanfield fkk should have right to move in what they like and textile people should refrain from going there .

co-operative funeralcare is sending special " last orders " beer mats across the uk to encourage people to talk about their funerals over a pint .
the mats are being sent to pubs in 21 cities across the country .
the company said surveys had suggested that half of all mourners felt funerals they had attended did not adequately reflect the individual 's life .
it has suggested personal touches including choosing pop songs instead of hymns , releasing doves , using a motorcycle hearse or donning football colours for the ceremony .
after a couple of pints , people say things they do n't really mean adam heath , national association of funeral directors it will produce an information booklet with some of the best ideas it receives .
" it 's a subject area that a lot of people do n't want to think about until it happens , " a company spokeswoman told bbc news online .
" a lot of people are not aware of the options that are available .
hopefully this will get people to be more open . "
she said it was important to mourners that funerals encapsulated the life of the person to whom they were bidding farewell .
a survey conducted for the co-op in 2000 found there was a growing appetite for custom-made ceremonies .
some of those surveyed suggested having gangland-style funeral processions , or mixing their ashes with gunpowder for a fireworks display .
it also found most people wanted mourners to wear bright-coloured clothes instead of black .
' strange ' adam heath , from the national association of funeral directors , said it " seemed like a strange idea " to try and foster conversations about death at a pub .
funeral ideas motorcycle-hearses or horse-drawn hearses gangland-style funeral processions hiring new orleans-style jazz bands mixing ashes with gunpowder for fireworks show putting part of the ashes in lockets for loved ones to carry " after a couple of pints , people say things they do n't really mean .
i know i do , " he said .
but he agreed people needed to talk more with relatives and friends about what they wanted from their own funerals .
he said horse-drawn hearses and handmade coffins were becoming increasingly popular in services .
david kaye , editor of the funeral services journal , said being more open about one 's wishes would ease the burden on those left behind .
" it 's always been the problem that someone dies and the family is left worrying about whether they 'll organise the right kind of service , " he said .

' inhumane and ineffective ' the study ' a measure of success ' , for the 2003/4 financial year , analyses the prison service 's performance against its main targets .
these also include number of hours inmates are involved in " purposeful activity " , the numbers of serious assaults on inmates and staff , educational skill awards , and suicides .
preston also emerged as one of three prisons , along with durham and blakenhurst , with four prisoners taking their own lives .
the prt claims the report shows the failure of the prison service to meet the majority of its own kpi targets and shows they do not " reflect the diverse needs of prisoners " .
" this report demonstrates that overcrowded jails do n't work , " said enver solomon , the report 's author .
" they are unsafe , inhumane and ineffective .
far too many prisoners are passively serving time when they should be actively paying back the damage they have caused to communities . "

swansea came in at eighth , with 71.6 % of prisoners sharing .
a prison service spokesman said jails were making progress , considering the overall prison population .

archaeologists have unearthed two buildings dating back to the 1200s .
historical evidence shows that one of the largest settlements in wales during 13th century is somewhere in the area .
but archaeologists have said the exact location has never been pin-pointed , and they hope that the excavations have revealed the lost city .
stuart wilson , who is part of monmouth archaeological society , said he was convinced the dig would reveal further evidence of the city 's existence a few miles south of the present-day village of trellech .
" for a long time , we thought the city was near the church in the village , " he said .
we believe that it was an alien town set up by the norman french and that in 1296 there was a battle where the welsh destroyed it stephen clarke " but we found nothing during our excavations so we started looking elsewhere . "
groups of volunteers have unearthed the remains of two dwellings which they think could be part of the 400-house city , undetected for the past seven centuries .
" i say it 's a city because it had so many more burgages -lsb- houses -rsb- than cardiff at the time of its existence , " said mr wilson .
" the first house we found dates to 1250 but we have found evidence that there was a serious fire which destroyed it . "
mr wilson said they came to the location of what they think is the buried city by studying the landscape for tell-tale dips and flats which suggested that houses had once been there .
they began an excavation and discovered the remains of ancient walls which turned out to be houses .
chairman of the society stephen clarke said he was " convinced " the remains were those of the lost city .
pieces of pottery have been found " we believe that it was an alien town set up by the norman french and that in 1296 there was a battle where the welsh destroyed it , " he said .
" and this is backed up by the evidence of the fire .
" it has been absolutely amazing to find it because for 30 years we were looking for it in the village .
" but we could find nothing on any of the digs we made and now it looks as though we are right on top of it . "
it is thought that the settlement housed workers for the iron industry of the area - society members have described it as being the " medieval merthyr " .
stuart wilson is so convinced that they have located the town that he has even bought a field which is believed to have hundreds of the lost city 's homes buried in it .
