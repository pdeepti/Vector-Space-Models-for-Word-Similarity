bbci collective 's daniel etherington looks at what you will be playing with in years to come .
so , what do gamers want next from hardware ?
what do you want from that machine in your living room or pocket ?
while i am asking questions , where has the psx got to ?
it came out in japan on 13 december 2003 and it is now down for a european release in the 2004 to 2005 financial year .
is this a playstation fan 's dream come true ?
time will tell .
we do know what some of the functions originally mooted for this ps2-with-bells-on device have been dropped such as mp3 playback .
it still boasts a slew of features , notably a broadband connection , dvd and tv recording , and usb connection to a sony digital camera , as well as psone and ps2 backwards compatibility .
all-singing , all-dancing ?
sony seem to be being playing psx and ps3 pretty close to their chest at the moment , but then microsoft is not exactly being forthcoming about the xbox 2 , or whatever they are calling it - xbox next , codename xenon .
one thing is for sure about upcoming hardware .
sony will be entering the handheld arena , with its widescreen , streamline , usb-port proffering , memory-stick toting , 1.8gb optical-disc spinning psp , due here next christmas . "
maybe a pared down , tweaked version of media center in a console would be the way forward in making a more diverse multimedia device from your traditional games machine " and as for nintendo ?
what about the gamecube 2 , which is not being referred to as codename dolphin 2 as far as i know .
will nintendo defiantly stick to their concept of handheld / console connectivity , or will they go the route of creating an all-singing , all-dancing home entertainment device like the competitors seem set on ?
either way , it may well be the first of the true next generation consoles out , with nintendo allegedly looking for a spring 2005 release .
i am still not entirely won over by the notion of making consoles more into home media centres .
exciting times this is a viable proposition for home computers as the interface of a keyboard and monitor is a lot more versatile than that of a joy pad and tv .
sure , my dreamcast had a keyboard , but it spent most of its active life , er , inactive .
a windows operating system already manages multimedia activities , even more so as microsoft have their windows xp home media center , a variant on xp professional aimed at home entertainment .
it integrates standard windows functionality , tv , gaming , home video and digital photography .
maybe a pared down , tweaked version of media center in a console would be the way forward in making a more diverse multimedia device from your traditional games machine .
whether such a thing will actually appear in xbox 2 , or if ps3 or gamecube 2 are to offer something comparable , will have to stay conjectural until credible info drips down from the corporate powers that be .
as for psp , it does not look like sony will make the mistakes of nokia , whose n-gage remains a frankly less than compelling proposition for this particular gamer .
the hybridisation of mobile phone and games console does not look so comfortable yet , so the psp is going to be a high-spec games machine .
the hybridisation of dvd player , broadband communications device and games machine , on the other hand , has been vindicated by xbox and ps2 and naturalised into console culture .
whatever the next few years bring , it is an exciting time to be a gamer .
as long as the importance of gameplay does not get subsumed into the enthusiasm about that old chestnut " convergence " .

bbci collective 's daniel etherington looks at what you will be playing with in years to come .

time will tell .
we do know what some of the functions originally mooted for this ps2-with-bells-on device have been dropped such as mp3 playback .
it still boasts a slew of features , notably a broadband connection , dvd and tv recording , and usb connection to a sony digital camera , as well as psone and ps2 backwards compatibility .
all-singing , all-dancing ?
sony seem to be being playing psx and ps3 pretty close to their chest at the moment , but then microsoft is not exactly being forthcoming about the xbox 2 , or whatever they are calling it - xbox next , codename xenon .
one thing is for sure about upcoming hardware .
sony will be entering the handheld arena , with its widescreen , streamline , usb-port proffering , memory-stick toting , 1.8gb optical-disc spinning psp , due here next christmas .
maybe a pared down , tweaked version of media center in a console would be the way forward in making a more diverse multimedia device from your traditional games machine discuss this story on bbci collective and as for nintendo ?
what about the gamecube 2 , which is not being referred to as codename dolphin 2 as far as i know .
will nintendo defiantly stick to their concept of handheld / console connectivity , or will they go the route of creating an all-singing , all-dancing home entertainment device like the competitors seem set on ?
either way , it may well be the first of the true next generation consoles out , with nintendo allegedly looking for a spring 2005 release .
i am still not entirely won over by the notion of making consoles more into home media centres .
exciting times this is a viable proposition for home computers as the interface of a keyboard and monitor is a lot more versatile than that of a joy pad and tv .
sure , my dreamcast had a keyboard , but it spent most of its active life , er , inactive .
a windows operating system already manages multimedia activities , even more so as microsoft have their windows xp home media center , a variant on xp professional aimed at home entertainment .
it integrates standard windows functionality , tv , gaming , home video and digital photography .

maybe a pared down , tweaked version of media center in a console would be the way forward in making a more diverse multimedia device from your traditional games machine .
whether such a thing will actually appear in xbox 2 , or if ps3 or gamecube 2 are to offer something comparable , will have to stay conjectural until credible info drips down from the corporate powers that be .
as for psp , it does not look like sony will make the mistakes of nokia , whose n-gage remains a frankly less than compelling proposition for this particular gamer .
the hybridisation of mobile phone and games console does not look so comfortable yet , so the psp is going to be a high-spec games machine .
the hybridisation of dvd player , broadband communications device and games machine , on the other hand , has been vindicated by xbox and ps2 and naturalised into console culture .

just 145 soldiers from the 24th foot , which two years later became the south wales borderers , held off an army of thousands of zulu warriors at the battle of rorke 's drift during south africa 's anglo-zulu war in 1879 .
the losses of the british garrison were reported as 17 dead and 10 wounded , with the zulus losing 450 men before retreating .
ex-soldiers in the borderers , which has since merged with other regiments to form the modern-day royal regiment of wales , have flown to africa to join welsh first minister rhodri morgan , zulu chief mangosuthu buthelezi and british high commissioner in south africa , ann grant , in remembrance of their heroic predecessors on friday .
rorke 's drift was always regarded as significant in south wales , but the film zulu really helped fire the imagination rodney ashwood the defenders of rorke 's drift were awarded seven victoria crosses - the largest number awarded to a regiment for a single action - for the defence of rorke 's drift , which was later given cinematic treatment in the 1964 classic film zulu , starring michael caine , stanley baker and ivor emmanuel .
four other victoria crosses were awarded to other regiments for their role in the two battles .
links between the zulu nation and wales have been forged since the legendary battle and a largely zulu regiment in the modern-day south african army awards a bravery medal named after rorke 's drift soldier john chard - the character played by rhondda actor baker in the film .
retired royal regiment of wales soldier rodney ashwood , from brecon , said the battle of rorke 's drift had always had a prominent place in the folklore of welsh troops , but the film had made the stand famous to the wider public .
rhodri morgan will attend a staging of the battle of isandlwana mr ashwood , who is a trustee of the regiment 's museum , in brecon , said : " there are records of rorke 's drift being commemorated in the 1920s and 1930s with re-enactments taking place .
" it was always regarded as significant in south wales , but the film zulu really helped fire the imagination .
" zulu is a wonderful film , but historically there are a number of errors .
" the film takes place in daylight , whereas in reality , the battle began at 4.30pm and went on throughout the night .
" in the film , private henry hook is a drunk , but in real life , he was quite the opposite .
" it is also inaccurate that the zulu army stopped on top of the hill and sang to the welsh soldiers .
" in reality , they had been on the march for four or five days and simply withdrew when they started sustaining casualties . "
eleven victoria cross medals were awarded after rorke 's drift the 125th anniversary service in kwa-zulu natal province will feature a re-enactment of the battle of isandlwana in which 1,500 soldiers from the borderers were killed by zulu forces , who then marched on the isolated border post of rorke 's drift , defended by a much smaller force from the same regiment .
first minister rhodri morgan flew out on thursday to take part in the commemorative events .
" the battles of isandhlwana and rorke 's drift have a particular significance for the people of wales and the zulu nation , " he said .
" the south wales borderers -lrb- 24th foot -rrb- was one of the most famous and distinguished regiments in wales .
" their heroism at rorke 's drift was recognised with the largest number of victoria crosses awarded to a single regiment for any one action .
" the supreme bravery of those 145 men who beat thousands of attacking zulu warriors into retreat has now passed into the realms of popular folklore and been forever immortalised in the film zulu .
" the zulu victory at isandlwana , immediately before rorke 's drift , was one of the british army 's worst and bloodiest defeats . "
mr morgan will be presenting a commemorative sword to local dignitary chief mangasuto buthelese .
his visit will also include a visit to a school twinned with ysgol gyfun gymraeg llanharri .

the report also found that two of the biggest agricultural landowners in the region the duke of bedford -lrb- with his woburn abbey estate -rrb- and lord de ramsey -lrb- with land in cambridgeshire and lincolnshire -rrb- each collect about Â£ 388,000 in subsidies a year .
the oxfam survey found that 75 farmers in suffolk , norfolk and lincolnshire between them shared Â£ 16m in subsidy , with an average cereal subsidy of Â£ 213,000 per farm .
it found that eight farms in lincolnshire received an average subsidy of Â£ 338,000 .
the survey also reveals that the country 's 15,000 smallest holdings receive about the same level of support as that provided to the biggest 224 holdings .
estimated subsidy to rich agricultural landowners -lrb- source : oxfam -rrb- duke of westminster : Â£ 326,000 sir adrian swire : Â£ 200,000 lord iliffe : Â£ 331,000 duke of marlborough : Â£ 369,000 duke of bedford : Â£ 369,000 earl of leicester : Â£ 245,000 lord de ramsey : Â£ 377,000 oxfam believes the european union 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- encourages over-production of goods , but this has been disputed by farmers ' leaders .
oxfam 's director of campaigns adrian lovett said : " these big farmers are the winners from a system that fails almost everyone else .
" uk taxpayers ' money is being used to line the pockets of the rich , while small british farmers are struggling to get by . "
oxfam has recommended a Â£ 20,000 cap on the level of subsidy any one farmer can receive and a redistribution of payments in favour of smaller farmers and the environment .
but oxfam has been criticised for failing to point out that any reduction in subsidy for farmers would be likely to lead to an increase in the price of food in the shops .
guy smith , who farms 1,000 acres of land at st osyth in essex and receives about Â£ 100,000 in subsidy a year , said farmers were paid the same now as they were 30 years ago for wheat although other farming costs had increased by a vast amount .

something the cap has done is provide very affordable food for people , " he said .
" you must also remember that farmers in the uk have to compete with farmers across the world who are heavily subsidised . "
michael hart , who farms about 100 acres of land in cornwall and used to run a farm in northamptonshire , said he was pleased that oxfam had started a debate on the cap .
but mr hart , who is chairman of the small and family farms alliance , said he felt that the low and falling price of food rather than the cap led to overproduction .
he said farmers had to produce more food to receive the same money .
mr hart said : " a lot of what oxfam says is good , but people need to understand there are no simple answers .
small farms in the peak district the oxfam report says many small farmers in the peak district are struggling to survive sue jackson 's beef and sheep farm in the peaks national park makes a loss despite receiving a small subsidy of between Â£ 3,000 and 5,000 ed bradbury 's 260-acre dairy farm near matlock in derbyshire made a profit of about Â£ 4,320 in 2002 .
" we need to decide what we want .
if we decide we want cheap food , then we go for large farms .
if we want family farms and greater animal welfare we need a more reasonable price for what we produce . "
the national farmers ' union has criticised the report as " inaccurate and one-sided " .
nfu president sir ben gill said : " nowhere within this report is there any recognition of the benefits of the cap reform - the most radical changes ever - and the benefits it will bring to farmers , society as a whole and the third world .
" the reforms will bring a more market-focused agriculture industry , vast environmental benefits , a fairer trading system that will break down trade barriers , and potentially less bureaucracy . "

the report also found that two of the biggest agricultural landowners in the region the duke of bedford -lrb- with his woburn abbey estate -rrb- and lord de ramsey -lrb- with land in cambridgeshire and lincolnshire -rrb- each collect about Â£ 388,000 in subsidies a year .
the oxfam survey found that 75 farmers in suffolk , norfolk and lincolnshire between them shared Â£ 16m in subsidy , with an average cereal subsidy of Â£ 213,000 per farm .
it found that eight farms in lincolnshire received an average subsidy of Â£ 338,000 .
the survey also reveals that the country 's 15,000 smallest holdings receive about the same level of support as that provided to the biggest 224 holdings .
estimated subsidy to rich agricultural landowners -lrb- source : oxfam -rrb- duke of westminster : Â£ 326,000 sir adrian swire : Â£ 200,000 lord iliffe : Â£ 331,000 duke of marlborough : Â£ 369,000 duke of bedford : Â£ 369,000 earl of leicester : Â£ 245,000 lord de ramsey : Â£ 377,000 oxfam believes the european union 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- encourages over-production of goods , but this has been disputed by farmers ' leaders .
oxfam 's director of campaigns adrian lovett said : " these big farmers are the winners from a system that fails almost everyone else .
" uk taxpayers ' money is being used to line the pockets of the rich , while small british farmers are struggling to get by . "
oxfam has recommended a Â£ 20,000 cap on the level of subsidy any one farmer can receive and a redistribution of payments in favour of smaller farmers and the environment .
but oxfam has been criticised for failing to point out that any reduction in subsidy for farmers would be likely to lead to an increase in the price of food in the shops .
guy smith , who farms 1,000 acres of land at st osyth in essex and receives about Â£ 100,000 in subsidy a year , said farmers were paid the same now as they were 30 years ago for wheat although other farming costs had increased by a vast amount .
county average cereal subsidy to each farm in four areas -lrb- source : oxfam report -rrb- cambridgeshire -lrb- 16 farms -rrb- : Â£ 195,000 suffolk -lrb- 21 farms -rrb- : Â£ 191,000 norfolk -lrb- 30 farms -rrb- : Â£ 203,000 lincolnshire -lrb- 8 farms -rrb- : Â£ 338,000 " people take food for granted .
something the cap has done is provide very affordable food for people , " he said .
" you must also remember that farmers in the uk have to compete with farmers across the world who are heavily subsidised . "
michael hart , who farms about 100 acres of land in cornwall and used to run a farm in northamptonshire , said he was pleased that oxfam had started a debate on the cap .
but mr hart , who is chairman of the small and family farms alliance , said he felt that the low and falling price of food rather than the cap led to overproduction .
he said farmers had to produce more food to receive the same money .
mr hart said : " a lot of what oxfam says is good , but people need to understand there are no simple answers .
small farms in the peak district the oxfam report says many small farmers in the peak district are struggling to survive sue jackson 's beef and sheep farm in the peaks national park makes a loss despite receiving a small subsidy of between Â£ 3,000 and 5,000 ed bradbury 's 260-acre dairy farm near matlock in derbyshire made a profit of about Â£ 4,320 in 2002 .
" we need to decide what we want .
if we decide we want cheap food , then we go for large farms .
if we want family farms and greater animal welfare we need a more reasonable price for what we produce . "
the national farmers ' union has criticised the report as " inaccurate and one-sided " .
nfu president sir ben gill said : " nowhere within this report is there any recognition of the benefits of the cap reform - the most radical changes ever - and the benefits it will bring to farmers , society as a whole and the third world .
" the reforms will bring a more market-focused agriculture industry , vast environmental benefits , a fairer trading system that will break down trade barriers , and potentially less bureaucracy . "
