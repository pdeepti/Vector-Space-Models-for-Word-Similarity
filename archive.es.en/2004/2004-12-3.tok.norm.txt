21 vote and then jointly figure out how to resolve independent ukraine 's worst political crisis . expectations were hight that a third vote since oct .
31 will take place early next year , although it still remained unclear if the poll will be held from scratch - opening the field to other candidates - or just be a run-off between pro-moscow candidate viktor yanukovych and his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said that a month would be needed to set a date for another election - and that if it does go ahead , it should remain a choice between the current two candidates . " i think in the next election it is very important that it is between the two candidates who have been fighting for the presidency , " he said . bildunterschrift : ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , polish president alexander kwasniewski , ukrainian president leonid kuchma , lithuanian president valdas adamkus , ukrainian prime minister and pro-moscow presidential candidate viktor yanukovych , european union foreign policy chief javier solana , secretary-general of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe jan kubis , -lrb- seen from the back -rrb- , from left " as for the date of the election , the sooner the better ... for political reasons , for economic reasons , " solana said .
" the longer the process takes , it will harm the economy , that does n't benefit anyone . " parliament votes out government meanwhile the political turmoil raged on as parliament backed an opposition demand to vote out the ruling party government and replace it with a " popular government " of a new interim coalition . more than three hours of closed-door talks ended with a decision to leave the fate of ukraine 's presidency in the hands of supreme court justices . " the parties reached an agreement to conduct the next session of the roundtable after the verdict is reached by the ukrainian supreme court , " solana said while flanked by yushchenko and yanukovych . the talks - although not entirely conclusive - seemed to hold something for everyone . kuchma met an opposition demand by agreeing to amend the country 's election laws to fit with the supreme court ruling amid growing expectation that justices will rule that at least a part of runoff vote was invalid . opposition calls off blockade yushchenko meanwhile agreed to call off a five-day blockade of government buildings by his supporters . " i think the government is giving in to the pressure from the street and western politicians , and not only western politicians , " he said .
" there is progress concerning the organization of a new election .
when the government shows goodwill , when it is open and sincere during the talks , we do n't need the government building or the presidential building .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.12.2004 one euro , one way out of unemployment ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking the first step for those out of work , the government has introduced a new category of low-paying jobs to supplement welfare .
so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these per hour of work officials hope the one-euro jobs are the incentive jobless need to get back in the work force .
at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .
" the people who do n't have a chance in the regular labor force can get a foothold there by working a job like this , " he added .
" they make contacts through these jobs that can lead to something later .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these per hour of work officials hope the one-euro jobs are the incentive jobless need to get back in the work force .
at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .

not so common - just one in fact - in the last 5 matches third-place stuttgart find themselves in a slump as they host bochum who is currently in the drop zone .
goals have been in short supply for a stuttgart team filled with offensive weapons .
coach matthias sammer would like some more talent on the squad : “ we have high hopes but quality is expensive .
with a bit more we could go far , " he said . bochum ’ s arrival should be good for sammer ’ s squad .
bochum have an abominable record in stuttgart , having won only four of 27 fixtures there .
bochum is hoping that they can carry over the quality of play from last week ’ s 3-1 victory against nuremberg . defending champs werder bremen still have not got into the groove this season .

not so common - just one in fact - in the last 5 matches third-place stuttgart find themselves in a slump as they host bochum who is currently in the drop zone .
goals have been in short supply for a stuttgart team filled with offensive weapons .
coach matthias sammer would like some more talent on the squad : “ we have high hopes but quality is expensive .
with a bit more we could go far , " he said . bochum ’ s arrival should be good for sammer ’ s squad .
bochum have an abominable record in stuttgart , having won only four of 27 fixtures there .
bochum is hoping that they can carry over the quality of play from last week ’ s 3-1 victory against nuremberg . defending champs werder bremen still have not got into the groove this season .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .
the terrorists were apprehend based on data taken from mobile phone conversations .
still , those in charge of data protection in germany say they want to proceed cautiously .
question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .
even worse off would be the smaller and mid-size internet companies , who would have to pay as much as € 50 millionen -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- to put the measures into effect .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .
the terrorists were apprehend based on data taken from mobile phone conversations .
still , those in charge of data protection in germany say they want to proceed cautiously .
question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .
even worse off would be the smaller and mid-size internet companies , who would have to pay as much as € 50 millionen -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- to put the measures into effect .
" they would go right out of business , " eichele said dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these per hour of work officials hope the one-euro jobs are the incentive jobless need to get back in the work force .
at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .
" the people who do n't have a chance in the regular labor force can get a foothold there by working a job like this , " he added .

not so common - just one in fact - in the last 5 matches third-place stuttgart find themselves in a slump as they host bochum who is currently in the drop zone .
goals have been in short supply for a stuttgart team filled with offensive weapons .
coach matthias sammer would like some more talent on the squad : “ we have high hopes but quality is expensive .
with a bit more we could go far , " he said . bochum ’ s arrival should be good for sammer ’ s squad .
bochum have an abominable record in stuttgart , having won only four of 27 fixtures there .
bochum is hoping that they can carry over the quality of play from last week ’ s 3-1 victory against nuremberg . defending champs werder bremen still have not got into the groove this season .
thomas schaaf ’ s club is not playing badly but they fail to make the kill in games they should win .
freiburg must be easy prey .
volker finke ’ s side is wallowing in the relegation zone with 10 points and there is already lots of talk about preparing for the second division next season . wolfsburg have dropped its last two matches , falling from first place to fourth in that span .
a hard-fought game against berlin last week might leave a bitter taste in their mouth and now they must play at leverkusen , one of the best home teams in the league .
erik gerets ’ wolfsburg have also lost four successive away matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho was a one-man wrecking crew in wolfsburg .
hertha berlin have collected 11 points in their last five games .
in fact , three of those were road victories .
this week they play against borussia mönchengladbach at the “ unfriendly ” confines of berlin ’ s olympic stadium where they have not won since october 16 . gladbach ’ s new coach dick advokaat has not turned things around -lrb- one victory in four games -rrb- since he took over on november 2 .
advokaat , who calls himself a disciplinarian , promises to stir things up in the winter break .

anyone who wants to help minorities integrate is wasting their time insisting on pledges of allegiance to the german constitution . what they have to do instead is provide education and language courses .
training imams and muslim teachers at german schools , moreover , would not only be one way of reducing the risk of inflammatory preaching in german mosques , it would also be a gesture of recognition to the muslim community . politicians should also stop insisting the country 's muslims distance themselves from fundamentalism and terrorist activity perpetrated in the name of islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-nur mosque in berlin it may seem like a reasonable demand - but what exactly is expected from germany 's mainly turkish muslim community ? should it take to the streets in protest every time a terrorist attack takes place in cairo , riyadh or jakarta ? adding to the problem is the fact germany lacks an organization tasked with representing the majority of muslims .

training imams and muslim teachers at german schools , moreover , would not only be one way of reducing the risk of inflammatory preaching in german mosques , it would also be a gesture of recognition to the muslim community . politicians should also stop insisting the country 's muslims distance themselves from fundamentalism and terrorist activity perpetrated in the name of islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-nur mosque in berlin it may seem like a reasonable demand - but what exactly is expected from germany 's mainly turkish muslim community ? should it take to the streets in protest every time a terrorist attack takes place in cairo , riyadh or jakarta ? adding to the problem is the fact germany lacks an organization tasked with representing the majority of muslims .
even if the many rival associations were to join forces , most muslims in germany do n't belong to religious groups - and have little interest in ever changing that . rainer sollich -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

" i 'm addicted . "
rather than quit he would simply have to find different ways to deal with the higher prices , he added .
" first i 'll try the cheap no-name brands they sell at -lrb- discount supermarket -rrb- aldi , they are at least 70 cents cheaper than the brand name cigarettes , " he said .
" i can still pay that .
and i know a guy who can get whole cartons of cigarettes for € 20 .

21 vote and then jointly figure out how to resolve independent ukraine 's worst political crisis . expectations were hight that a third vote since oct .
31 will take place early next year , although it still remained unclear if the poll will be held from scratch - opening the field to other candidates - or just be a run-off between pro-moscow candidate viktor yanukovych and his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said that a month would be needed to set a date for another election - and that if it does go ahead , it should remain a choice between the current two candidates . " i think in the next election it is very important that it is between the two candidates who have been fighting for the presidency , " he said . bildunterschrift : ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , polish president alexander kwasniewski , ukrainian president leonid kuchma , lithuanian president valdas adamkus , ukrainian prime minister and pro-moscow presidential candidate viktor yanukovych , european union foreign policy chief javier solana , secretary-general of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe jan kubis , -lrb- seen from the back -rrb- , from left " as for the date of the election , the sooner the better ... for political reasons , for economic reasons , " solana said .
" the longer the process takes , it will harm the economy , that does n't benefit anyone . " parliament votes out government meanwhile the political turmoil raged on as parliament backed an opposition demand to vote out the ruling party government and replace it with a " popular government " of a new interim coalition . more than three hours of closed-door talks ended with a decision to leave the fate of ukraine 's presidency in the hands of supreme court justices . " the parties reached an agreement to conduct the next session of the roundtable after the verdict is reached by the ukrainian supreme court , " solana said while flanked by yushchenko and yanukovych . the talks - although not entirely conclusive - seemed to hold something for everyone . kuchma met an opposition demand by agreeing to amend the country 's election laws to fit with the supreme court ruling amid growing expectation that justices will rule that at least a part of runoff vote was invalid . opposition calls off blockade yushchenko meanwhile agreed to call off a five-day blockade of government buildings by his supporters . " i think the government is giving in to the pressure from the street and western politicians , and not only western politicians , " he said .
" there is progress concerning the organization of a new election .
when the government shows goodwill , when it is open and sincere during the talks , we do n't need the government building or the presidential building .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these per hour of work officials hope the one-euro jobs are the incentive jobless need to get back in the work force .
at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .
" the people who do n't have a chance in the regular labor force can get a foothold there by working a job like this , " he added .
" they make contacts through these jobs that can lead to something later .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .

a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .

" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .

" we order the central election commission to set a date for a new runoff vote from dec .
5 , 2004 in accordance with the law , " the court 's chief justice anatoly yarema announced .
" the court decision is final and can not be appealed . " a representative of pro-western opposition leader and presidential candidate viktor yushchenko said the law stipulated that a vote must take place three weeks from the date announced by the court for the start of the campaign . " i think it will be the 26th " of december , yushchenko representative yury kluchkovsky said . opposition supporters hailed the court 's ruling and predicted it would be accepted by all political forces in this country of 48 million people . " a huge victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian deputy mykola katerynchuk , who represents opposition candidate viktor yushchenko , celebrate as the judges exit from the court " this is a huge victory for all those people who have been standing out on the square , " said a yushchenko spokesman , mykola katerynchuk -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , referring to the tens of thousands of opposition protesters who have camped out in the streets of the capital since the contested nov .

" this was the decision that the entire country , and , i think , europe and the rest of the world hoped for , " rybachuk said . us , eu welcome ruling the united states and the european union immediately welcomed the court ruling . " the court 's decision is an important step in moving toward a peaceful , democratic resolution that reflects the will of the people , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner had a similar response .

" the court effectively played a political role , " said stepan gavrich , a yanukovych representative , according to interfax news agency . it " even went beyond the plaintiff 's appeal -lrb- that -rrb- did not ask for another runoff vote , but had asked to annul results , " he added . there was no immediate comment from yanukovych himself or from outgoing president leonid kuchma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin -lrb- left -rrb- and kuchma during an earlier meeting kuchma , who supported yanukovych , on thursday met russian president vladimir putin and both leaders made clear afterwards that they opposed a re-run only of the yushchenko-versus-yanukovych contest , favoring instead a repeat of the entire election process - a plan vehemently opposed by the opposition . kuchma promised to sack the yanukovych government as demanded by yushchenko following a vote of no-confidence in parliament , but that promise was conditioned on acceptance of a wider kuchma plan to implement controversial political reforms , the fate of which were uncertain after the ruling . russia attacks eu , osce prior to the court 's ruling , lawmakers in neighboring russia fired off another salvo at the west , accusing the european union , the european parliament and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- of fomenting unrest in ukraine that could destabilize the continent . actions by these bodies , the russian state duma said , could lead to " massive disorder , chaos and a split of the country " and " this will have the most negative consequences not only for ukraine but for russia , all of europe and for the international community as a whole . " several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovich was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . one of those regions , donetsk , has already set a date next month for holding a referendum on whether to seek greater autonomy . parliament votes to pull out of iraq as if to highlight the larger stakes in the ukraine political situation , the country 's parliament earlier in the day voted to demand the pullout of the 1,600 ukrainian troops based in iraq as part of the us-led coalition there . the opposition , which has supported such a move , complained that the timing of the parliament 's move was an effort to discredit them . poland , which commands the multinational division in iraq that includes the ukrainian forces , expressed alarm at the vote . but polish defence minister jerzy szmajdzinski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency , said warsaw was for the time being regarding it as a purely political statement pending a decision on it by kuchma . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should ukraine 's elections be repeated ?

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these per hour of work officials hope the one-euro jobs are the incentive jobless need to get back in the work force .
at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .
" the people who do n't have a chance in the regular labor force can get a foothold there by working a job like this , " he added .
" they make contacts through these jobs that can lead to something later .

even though the winter break is fast approaching , the 16th week in the bundesliga features two derbies including one of the fiercest : dortmund vs. schalke .
also , bayern travels to nuremberg for the “ bavarian ” derby . the first leg of the bundesliga is nearing its end .
bayern munich are looking to go into the break with the lead ; the contenders are trying to keep pace .
munich face their northern bavarian neighbor , nuremberg -lrb- actually , in franconia — the nurembergers don ’ t like being called bavarians -rrb- .
felix magath ’ s squad had a stellar november , winning all six of their matches , including a champions league and a german cup contest and jumped to the top of the standings . nuremberg are in 12th place and more concerned with staying in the top division , but there is no reason to believe that they will win this match .
the “ club ” have managed to take home three points against munich only once in their last seven meetings .
one fact that might stand in their favor is slovakian midfielder marek mintal .
he has found the mark 12 times , making him the league ’ s current goal-scoring leader . bayern munich , however , have an arsenal of weapons to beat any opponent : strikers roy makaay , claudio pizarro and super sub paolo guererro .
there ’ s also international midfielder michael ballack . and in the last row , they have germany ’ s number one keeper oliver kahn .
he has shown signs of weakness this season and now has an injured finger to boot .

there ’ s no love lost between the ruhr area clubs and the latest “ incident ” did not help . it occurred at the management level when schalke ’ s general manager , rudi assauer , offered financial assistance to debt-ridden dortmund in the form of a benefit match .
dortmund ’ s managing director , gerd niebaum , took offense and refused the offer , much to the displeasure of assauer . schalke can afford to be magnanimous to their poor cousins .
dortmund ’ s midfielder tomas rosicky summed up the significance of this match , saying “ for us it is about survival . ”
survival because borussia are just three points away from the relegation zone . schalke , on the other hand , have shot up to second place in the league under coach ralf rangnick .
they are brimming with confidence .
they are hot in the league .
and they have not lost to dortmund in their last 11 match-ups .
schalke ’ s international striker gerald asamoah has ticked his team for another victory against borussia : “ i do not think our run against dortmund will be coming to an end , " he said . hanover vs. hamburg : a mid-pack race one of the more interesting matches on saturday could be hamburg against hanover .

will the move change the habits of a nation of committed smokers ? its a direct hit to the smoker 's pocketbook : the price of cigarettes rose this week in germany by as much as 40 euro cents -lrb- 53 us cents -rrb- a pack .
the second of a projected three-part tobacco-tax increase went into effect on wednesday , and with it came an approximately 2 cent per cigarette increase in the cost of a package .
of that , 1.2 cents is due to the tobacco increase ; the rest goes directly to the individual tobacco companies .
more to come a third round of tax increases is expected to go into effect in september , 2005 .
the increased tax revenues are expected to finance government subsidies for non-typical public health care coverage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has frequently come under criticism for its weak efforts to curb smoking .
compared with many other western european countries , germany has cheaper cigarettes , fewer laws to curb public smoking , less anti-tobacco advertising , and more smoke friendly workplaces .
in other words , germany has been a very smoker-friendly nation .
in a recent study from the european network for smoking prevention , germany ranked in the bottom 10 of 25 countries examined .
a forced change in habits ?
but now , some say the increased prices are a step toward curbing a habit run amok .
the president of the german cancer society , dagmar schipanski , told ap news agency that her organization believes higher cigarette prices lead to less smoking overall .
" the last tax increases are already showing their effects , " she told ap in bonn .
" many people have quit , and more are doing it every day . "
and their information on smoking cessation is in such great demand that " we had to increase our print run , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a poll carried out by the nicorette company - makers of aids to help people quit smoking - germans were asked whether they would try to kick the habit because of a cigarette price hike .
half of the respondents said yes , according to a report on the n-tv television network .
but a smoker not affiliated with any non-smoking products told a different story .

will the move change the habits of a nation of committed smokers ? its a direct hit to the smoker 's pocketbook : the price of cigarettes rose this week in germany by as much as 40 euro cents -lrb- 53 us cents -rrb- a pack .
the second of a projected three-part tobacco-tax increase went into effect on wednesday , and with it came an approximately 2 cent per cigarette increase in the cost of a package .
of that , 1.2 cents is due to the tobacco increase ; the rest goes directly to the individual tobacco companies .
more to come a third round of tax increases is expected to go into effect in september , 2005 .
the increased tax revenues are expected to finance government subsidies for non-typical public health care coverage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has frequently come under criticism for its weak efforts to curb smoking .
compared with many other western european countries , germany has cheaper cigarettes , fewer laws to curb public smoking , less anti-tobacco advertising , and more smoke friendly workplaces .
in other words , germany has been a very smoker-friendly nation .
in a recent study from the european network for smoking prevention , germany ranked in the bottom 10 of 25 countries examined .
a forced change in habits ?
but now , some say the increased prices are a step toward curbing a habit run amok .
the president of the german cancer society , dagmar schipanski , told ap news agency that her organization believes higher cigarette prices lead to less smoking overall .
" the last tax increases are already showing their effects , " she told ap in bonn .
" many people have quit , and more are doing it every day . "
and their information on smoking cessation is in such great demand that " we had to increase our print run , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a poll carried out by the nicorette company - makers of aids to help people quit smoking - germans were asked whether they would try to kick the habit because of a cigarette price hike .
half of the respondents said yes , according to a report on the n-tv television network .
but a smoker not affiliated with any non-smoking products told a different story .
" of course i 'll keep smoking when the prices go up , " horst-walter erpenbach , a cologne-based registered nurse and committed smoker , told dw-world .

even though the winter break is fast approaching , the 16th week in the bundesliga features two derbies including one of the fiercest : dortmund vs. schalke .
also , bayern travels to nuremberg for the “ bavarian ” derby . the first leg of the bundesliga is nearing its end .
bayern munich are looking to go into the break with the lead ; the contenders are trying to keep pace .
munich face their northern bavarian neighbor , nuremberg -lrb- actually , in franconia — the nurembergers don ’ t like being called bavarians -rrb- .
felix magath ’ s squad had a stellar november , winning all six of their matches , including a champions league and a german cup contest and jumped to the top of the standings . nuremberg are in 12th place and more concerned with staying in the top division , but there is no reason to believe that they will win this match .
the “ club ” have managed to take home three points against munich only once in their last seven meetings .
one fact that might stand in their favor is slovakian midfielder marek mintal .
he has found the mark 12 times , making him the league ’ s current goal-scoring leader . bayern munich , however , have an arsenal of weapons to beat any opponent : strikers roy makaay , claudio pizarro and super sub paolo guererro .
there ’ s also international midfielder michael ballack . and in the last row , they have germany ’ s number one keeper oliver kahn .
he has shown signs of weakness this season and now has an injured finger to boot .
everyone knows this , including nuremberg ’ s coach wolfgang wolf , who plans to use the injury to his team 's advantage : “ we have to make oliver kahn use both his hands . ” dortmund , schalke : no love lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red cards are n't so unusual when dortmund and schalke meet .
the hottest match of the weekend takes place on sunday , when bitter rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 meet in westfalen stadion .
there ’ s no love lost between the ruhr area clubs and the latest “ incident ” did not help . it occurred at the management level when schalke ’ s general manager , rudi assauer , offered financial assistance to debt-ridden dortmund in the form of a benefit match .
dortmund ’ s managing director , gerd niebaum , took offense and refused the offer , much to the displeasure of assauer . schalke can afford to be magnanimous to their poor cousins .
dortmund ’ s midfielder tomas rosicky summed up the significance of this match , saying “ for us it is about survival . ”
survival because borussia are just three points away from the relegation zone . schalke , on the other hand , have shot up to second place in the league under coach ralf rangnick .
they are brimming with confidence .
they are hot in the league .
and they have not lost to dortmund in their last 11 match-ups .
schalke ’ s international striker gerald asamoah has ticked his team for another victory against borussia : “ i do not think our run against dortmund will be coming to an end , " he said . hanover vs. hamburg : a mid-pack race one of the more interesting matches on saturday could be hamburg against hanover .
coach thomas doll has fetched hamburg out of the relegation zone , depending on the offense to win games .
they have scored 12 goals in the last three matches and find themselves firmly in the middle of the pack .
unfortunately , one of their go-getters , sergej barbarez -lrb- 6 goals -rrb- has to sit this match out after receiving his fifth yellow card last week . hanover have been riding the success of goalie robert enke .
he has given up only one goal per game this season and helped hanover to an uefa cup spot — so far .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .

he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .

" the court decision is final and can not be appealed . " a representative of pro-western opposition leader and presidential candidate viktor yushchenko said the law stipulated that a vote must take place three weeks from the date announced by the court for the start of the campaign . " i think it will be the 26th " of december , yushchenko representative yury kluchkovsky said . opposition supporters hailed the court 's ruling and predicted it would be accepted by all political forces in this country of 48 million people .

" several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovich was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . one of those regions , donetsk , has already set a date next month for holding a referendum on whether to seek greater autonomy . parliament votes to pull out of iraq as if to highlight the larger stakes in the ukraine political situation , the country 's parliament earlier in the day voted to demand the pullout of the 1,600 ukrainian troops based in iraq as part of the us-led coalition there . the opposition , which has supported such a move , complained that the timing of the parliament 's move was an effort to discredit them . poland , which commands the multinational division in iraq that includes the ukrainian forces , expressed alarm at the vote . but polish defence minister jerzy szmajdzinski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency , said warsaw was for the time being regarding it as a purely political statement pending a decision on it by kuchma . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should ukraine 's elections be repeated ?

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .
the terrorists were apprehend based on data taken from mobile phone conversations .
still , those in charge of data protection in germany say they want to proceed cautiously .
question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .
even worse off would be the smaller and mid-size internet companies , who would have to pay as much as € 50 millionen -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- to put the measures into effect .

anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .
the terrorists were apprehend based on data taken from mobile phone conversations .
still , those in charge of data protection in germany say they want to proceed cautiously .
question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .
even worse off would be the smaller and mid-size internet companies , who would have to pay as much as € 50 millionen -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- to put the measures into effect .

" populism ? many would agree that even if the county 's three million muslims include just 3,000 extremists , the state is justified in resorting to extreme protective measures - the same measures it would use against german and non-muslim extremists , such as surveillance by domestic intelligence services and criminal proceedings in the case of proven offences .
crucially , however , anyone without a german passport can theoretically be deported . nonetheless , accusing muslim fundamentalists of being " potentially violent " is far from easy to back up , and hardly constitutes legal grounds for expulsion .
bosbach 's plan to throw some 3,000 suspected extremists out of the country overnight is little more than populism . only those who offend against existing laws can be deported - in other words , anyone who perpetrates violence or anyone who can be proved to have incited violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan after deportation to turkey the case of the " caliph of cologne , " metin kaplan -lrb- pictured -rrb- , a muslim fundamentalist recently deported to turkey after several years of legal wrangling , showed how complicated extradition can be - and how long it can take before the courts reach a binding decision . public pariahs in germany , the question of muslim and turkish integration is linked to the debate about potentially violent fundamentalism to a dangerous extent .
even though politicians across the board are quick to stress that the majority of muslims living in germany are peaceful and law-abiding , public debate descends all too often into a far less differentiated rhetoric . increasingly , muslims feel their religion makes them public pariahs - not a good basis for successful integration .
and a recent study shows that xenophobia is once again on the rise in germany . investing in integration projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in germany often tend to stay among themselves rather than wasting their time with theoretical discussions about what should constitute a " defining " german culture , or " leitkultur , " it 's time politicians used their common sense and invested more funds in integration projects .
anyone who wants to help minorities integrate is wasting their time insisting on pledges of allegiance to the german constitution . what they have to do instead is provide education and language courses .
training imams and muslim teachers at german schools , moreover , would not only be one way of reducing the risk of inflammatory preaching in german mosques , it would also be a gesture of recognition to the muslim community . politicians should also stop insisting the country 's muslims distance themselves from fundamentalism and terrorist activity perpetrated in the name of islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-nur mosque in berlin it may seem like a reasonable demand - but what exactly is expected from germany 's mainly turkish muslim community ? should it take to the streets in protest every time a terrorist attack takes place in cairo , riyadh or jakarta ? adding to the problem is the fact germany lacks an organization tasked with representing the majority of muslims .
even if the many rival associations were to join forces , most muslims in germany do n't belong to religious groups - and have little interest in ever changing that . rainer sollich -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .
it 's one part of a 20-point strategy for fighting extremism and promoting integration .

even though politicians across the board are quick to stress that the majority of muslims living in germany are peaceful and law-abiding , public debate descends all too often into a far less differentiated rhetoric . increasingly , muslims feel their religion makes them public pariahs - not a good basis for successful integration .
and a recent study shows that xenophobia is once again on the rise in germany . investing in integration projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in germany often tend to stay among themselves rather than wasting their time with theoretical discussions about what should constitute a " defining " german culture , or " leitkultur , " it 's time politicians used their common sense and invested more funds in integration projects .
anyone who wants to help minorities integrate is wasting their time insisting on pledges of allegiance to the german constitution . what they have to do instead is provide education and language courses .
training imams and muslim teachers at german schools , moreover , would not only be one way of reducing the risk of inflammatory preaching in german mosques , it would also be a gesture of recognition to the muslim community . politicians should also stop insisting the country 's muslims distance themselves from fundamentalism and terrorist activity perpetrated in the name of islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-nur mosque in berlin it may seem like a reasonable demand - but what exactly is expected from germany 's mainly turkish muslim community ? should it take to the streets in protest every time a terrorist attack takes place in cairo , riyadh or jakarta ? adding to the problem is the fact germany lacks an organization tasked with representing the majority of muslims .
even if the many rival associations were to join forces , most muslims in germany do n't belong to religious groups - and have little interest in ever changing that . rainer sollich -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these per hour of work officials hope the one-euro jobs are the incentive jobless need to get back in the work force .
at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .
" the people who do n't have a chance in the regular labor force can get a foothold there by working a job like this , " he added .
" they make contacts through these jobs that can lead to something later .

21 vote and then jointly figure out how to resolve independent ukraine 's worst political crisis . expectations were hight that a third vote since oct .
31 will take place early next year , although it still remained unclear if the poll will be held from scratch - opening the field to other candidates - or just be a run-off between pro-moscow candidate viktor yanukovych and his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said that a month would be needed to set a date for another election - and that if it does go ahead , it should remain a choice between the current two candidates . " i think in the next election it is very important that it is between the two candidates who have been fighting for the presidency , " he said . bildunterschrift : ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , polish president alexander kwasniewski , ukrainian president leonid kuchma , lithuanian president valdas adamkus , ukrainian prime minister and pro-moscow presidential candidate viktor yanukovych , european union foreign policy chief javier solana , secretary-general of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe jan kubis , -lrb- seen from the back -rrb- , from left " as for the date of the election , the sooner the better ... for political reasons , for economic reasons , " solana said .
" the longer the process takes , it will harm the economy , that does n't benefit anyone . " parliament votes out government meanwhile the political turmoil raged on as parliament backed an opposition demand to vote out the ruling party government and replace it with a " popular government " of a new interim coalition . more than three hours of closed-door talks ended with a decision to leave the fate of ukraine 's presidency in the hands of supreme court justices . " the parties reached an agreement to conduct the next session of the roundtable after the verdict is reached by the ukrainian supreme court , " solana said while flanked by yushchenko and yanukovych . the talks - although not entirely conclusive - seemed to hold something for everyone . kuchma met an opposition demand by agreeing to amend the country 's election laws to fit with the supreme court ruling amid growing expectation that justices will rule that at least a part of runoff vote was invalid . opposition calls off blockade yushchenko meanwhile agreed to call off a five-day blockade of government buildings by his supporters . " i think the government is giving in to the pressure from the street and western politicians , and not only western politicians , " he said .
" there is progress concerning the organization of a new election .
when the government shows goodwill , when it is open and sincere during the talks , we do n't need the government building or the presidential building .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .

for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these per hour of work officials hope the one-euro jobs are the incentive jobless need to get back in the work force .
at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .

21 vote and then jointly figure out how to resolve independent ukraine 's worst political crisis . expectations were hight that a third vote since oct .
31 will take place early next year , although it still remained unclear if the poll will be held from scratch - opening the field to other candidates - or just be a run-off between pro-moscow candidate viktor yanukovych and his western-leaning rival , viktor yushchenko . the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said that a month would be needed to set a date for another election - and that if it does go ahead , it should remain a choice between the current two candidates . " i think in the next election it is very important that it is between the two candidates who have been fighting for the presidency , " he said . bildunterschrift : ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , polish president alexander kwasniewski , ukrainian president leonid kuchma , lithuanian president valdas adamkus , ukrainian prime minister and pro-moscow presidential candidate viktor yanukovych , european union foreign policy chief javier solana , secretary-general of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe jan kubis , -lrb- seen from the back -rrb- , from left " as for the date of the election , the sooner the better ... for political reasons , for economic reasons , " solana said .
" the longer the process takes , it will harm the economy , that does n't benefit anyone . " parliament votes out government meanwhile the political turmoil raged on as parliament backed an opposition demand to vote out the ruling party government and replace it with a " popular government " of a new interim coalition . more than three hours of closed-door talks ended with a decision to leave the fate of ukraine 's presidency in the hands of supreme court justices . " the parties reached an agreement to conduct the next session of the roundtable after the verdict is reached by the ukrainian supreme court , " solana said while flanked by yushchenko and yanukovych . the talks - although not entirely conclusive - seemed to hold something for everyone . kuchma met an opposition demand by agreeing to amend the country 's election laws to fit with the supreme court ruling amid growing expectation that justices will rule that at least a part of runoff vote was invalid . opposition calls off blockade yushchenko meanwhile agreed to call off a five-day blockade of government buildings by his supporters . " i think the government is giving in to the pressure from the street and western politicians , and not only western politicians , " he said .
" there is progress concerning the organization of a new election .
when the government shows goodwill , when it is open and sincere during the talks , we do n't need the government building or the presidential building .

even though the winter break is fast approaching , the 16th week in the bundesliga features two derbies including one of the fiercest : dortmund vs. schalke .
also , bayern travels to nuremberg for the “ bavarian ” derby . the first leg of the bundesliga is nearing its end .
bayern munich are looking to go into the break with the lead ; the contenders are trying to keep pace .
munich face their northern bavarian neighbor , nuremberg -lrb- actually , in franconia — the nurembergers don ’ t like being called bavarians -rrb- .
felix magath ’ s squad had a stellar november , winning all six of their matches , including a champions league and a german cup contest and jumped to the top of the standings . nuremberg are in 12th place and more concerned with staying in the top division , but there is no reason to believe that they will win this match .
the “ club ” have managed to take home three points against munich only once in their last seven meetings .
one fact that might stand in their favor is slovakian midfielder marek mintal .
he has found the mark 12 times , making him the league ’ s current goal-scoring leader . bayern munich , however , have an arsenal of weapons to beat any opponent : strikers roy makaay , claudio pizarro and super sub paolo guererro .
there ’ s also international midfielder michael ballack . and in the last row , they have germany ’ s number one keeper oliver kahn .
he has shown signs of weakness this season and now has an injured finger to boot .
everyone knows this , including nuremberg ’ s coach wolfgang wolf , who plans to use the injury to his team 's advantage : “ we have to make oliver kahn use both his hands . ” dortmund , schalke : no love lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red cards are n't so unusual when dortmund and schalke meet .
the hottest match of the weekend takes place on sunday , when bitter rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 meet in westfalen stadion .
there ’ s no love lost between the ruhr area clubs and the latest “ incident ” did not help . it occurred at the management level when schalke ’ s general manager , rudi assauer , offered financial assistance to debt-ridden dortmund in the form of a benefit match .
dortmund ’ s managing director , gerd niebaum , took offense and refused the offer , much to the displeasure of assauer . schalke can afford to be magnanimous to their poor cousins .
dortmund ’ s midfielder tomas rosicky summed up the significance of this match , saying “ for us it is about survival . ”
survival because borussia are just three points away from the relegation zone . schalke , on the other hand , have shot up to second place in the league under coach ralf rangnick .
they are brimming with confidence .
they are hot in the league .
and they have not lost to dortmund in their last 11 match-ups .
schalke ’ s international striker gerald asamoah has ticked his team for another victory against borussia : “ i do not think our run against dortmund will be coming to an end , " he said . hanover vs. hamburg : a mid-pack race one of the more interesting matches on saturday could be hamburg against hanover .
coach thomas doll has fetched hamburg out of the relegation zone , depending on the offense to win games .
they have scored 12 goals in the last three matches and find themselves firmly in the middle of the pack .
unfortunately , one of their go-getters , sergej barbarez -lrb- 6 goals -rrb- has to sit this match out after receiving his fifth yellow card last week . hanover have been riding the success of goalie robert enke .
he has given up only one goal per game this season and helped hanover to an uefa cup spot — so far .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .
the terrorists were apprehend based on data taken from mobile phone conversations .
still , those in charge of data protection in germany say they want to proceed cautiously .
question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .
even worse off would be the smaller and mid-size internet companies , who would have to pay as much as € 50 millionen -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- to put the measures into effect .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .
the terrorists were apprehend based on data taken from mobile phone conversations .
still , those in charge of data protection in germany say they want to proceed cautiously .
question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .
even worse off would be the smaller and mid-size internet companies , who would have to pay as much as € 50 millionen -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- to put the measures into effect .
" they would go right out of business , " eichele said dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

will the move change the habits of a nation of committed smokers ? its a direct hit to the smoker 's pocketbook : the price of cigarettes rose this week in germany by as much as 40 euro cents -lrb- 53 us cents -rrb- a pack .
the second of a projected three-part tobacco-tax increase went into effect on wednesday , and with it came an approximately 2 cent per cigarette increase in the cost of a package .
of that , 1.2 cents is due to the tobacco increase ; the rest goes directly to the individual tobacco companies .
more to come a third round of tax increases is expected to go into effect in september , 2005 .
the increased tax revenues are expected to finance government subsidies for non-typical public health care coverage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has frequently come under criticism for its weak efforts to curb smoking .
compared with many other western european countries , germany has cheaper cigarettes , fewer laws to curb public smoking , less anti-tobacco advertising , and more smoke friendly workplaces .
in other words , germany has been a very smoker-friendly nation .
in a recent study from the european network for smoking prevention , germany ranked in the bottom 10 of 25 countries examined .
a forced change in habits ?
but now , some say the increased prices are a step toward curbing a habit run amok .
the president of the german cancer society , dagmar schipanski , told ap news agency that her organization believes higher cigarette prices lead to less smoking overall .
" the last tax increases are already showing their effects , " she told ap in bonn .
" many people have quit , and more are doing it every day . "
and their information on smoking cessation is in such great demand that " we had to increase our print run , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a poll carried out by the nicorette company - makers of aids to help people quit smoking - germans were asked whether they would try to kick the habit because of a cigarette price hike .
half of the respondents said yes , according to a report on the n-tv television network .
but a smoker not affiliated with any non-smoking products told a different story .
" of course i 'll keep smoking when the prices go up , " horst-walter erpenbach , a cologne-based registered nurse and committed smoker , told dw-world .
" i 'm addicted . "
rather than quit he would simply have to find different ways to deal with the higher prices , he added .
" first i 'll try the cheap no-name brands they sell at -lrb- discount supermarket -rrb- aldi , they are at least 70 cents cheaper than the brand name cigarettes , " he said .
" i can still pay that .
and i know a guy who can get whole cartons of cigarettes for € 20 .
i do n't know where he gets them , i think they come from ukraine or slovakia , but i do n't ask .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .
the terrorists were apprehend based on data taken from mobile phone conversations .
still , those in charge of data protection in germany say they want to proceed cautiously .
question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .
even worse off would be the smaller and mid-size internet companies , who would have to pay as much as € 50 millionen -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- to put the measures into effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.12.2004 one euro , one way out of unemployment ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking the first step for those out of work , the government has introduced a new category of low-paying jobs to supplement welfare .
so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these per hour of work officials hope the one-euro jobs are the incentive jobless need to get back in the work force .
at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these per hour of work officials hope the one-euro jobs are the incentive jobless need to get back in the work force .
at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .

even though the winter break is fast approaching , the 16th week in the bundesliga features two derbies including one of the fiercest : dortmund vs. schalke .
also , bayern travels to nuremberg for the “ bavarian ” derby . the first leg of the bundesliga is nearing its end .
bayern munich are looking to go into the break with the lead ; the contenders are trying to keep pace .
munich face their northern bavarian neighbor , nuremberg -lrb- actually , in franconia — the nurembergers don ’ t like being called bavarians -rrb- .
felix magath ’ s squad had a stellar november , winning all six of their matches , including a champions league and a german cup contest and jumped to the top of the standings . nuremberg are in 12th place and more concerned with staying in the top division , but there is no reason to believe that they will win this match .
the “ club ” have managed to take home three points against munich only once in their last seven meetings .
one fact that might stand in their favor is slovakian midfielder marek mintal .
he has found the mark 12 times , making him the league ’ s current goal-scoring leader . bayern munich , however , have an arsenal of weapons to beat any opponent : strikers roy makaay , claudio pizarro and super sub paolo guererro .
there ’ s also international midfielder michael ballack . and in the last row , they have germany ’ s number one keeper oliver kahn .
he has shown signs of weakness this season and now has an injured finger to boot .
everyone knows this , including nuremberg ’ s coach wolfgang wolf , who plans to use the injury to his team 's advantage : “ we have to make oliver kahn use both his hands . ” dortmund , schalke : no love lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red cards are n't so unusual when dortmund and schalke meet .
the hottest match of the weekend takes place on sunday , when bitter rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 meet in westfalen stadion .
there ’ s no love lost between the ruhr area clubs and the latest “ incident ” did not help . it occurred at the management level when schalke ’ s general manager , rudi assauer , offered financial assistance to debt-ridden dortmund in the form of a benefit match .
dortmund ’ s managing director , gerd niebaum , took offense and refused the offer , much to the displeasure of assauer . schalke can afford to be magnanimous to their poor cousins .
dortmund ’ s midfielder tomas rosicky summed up the significance of this match , saying “ for us it is about survival . ”
survival because borussia are just three points away from the relegation zone . schalke , on the other hand , have shot up to second place in the league under coach ralf rangnick .
they are brimming with confidence .
they are hot in the league .
and they have not lost to dortmund in their last 11 match-ups .
schalke ’ s international striker gerald asamoah has ticked his team for another victory against borussia : “ i do not think our run against dortmund will be coming to an end , " he said . hanover vs. hamburg : a mid-pack race one of the more interesting matches on saturday could be hamburg against hanover .
coach thomas doll has fetched hamburg out of the relegation zone , depending on the offense to win games .
they have scored 12 goals in the last three matches and find themselves firmly in the middle of the pack .
unfortunately , one of their go-getters , sergej barbarez -lrb- 6 goals -rrb- has to sit this match out after receiving his fifth yellow card last week . hanover have been riding the success of goalie robert enke .
he has given up only one goal per game this season and helped hanover to an uefa cup spot — so far .

" a huge victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian deputy mykola katerynchuk , who represents opposition candidate viktor yushchenko , celebrate as the judges exit from the court " this is a huge victory for all those people who have been standing out on the square , " said a yushchenko spokesman , mykola katerynchuk -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , referring to the tens of thousands of opposition protesters who have camped out in the streets of the capital since the contested nov .
21 vote .
" we think that all political forces respect this decision . " oleg rybachuk , a top yushchenko aide , was similarly pleased with the decision . " this was the decision that the entire country , and , i think , europe and the rest of the world hoped for , " rybachuk said . us , eu welcome ruling the united states and the european union immediately welcomed the court ruling . " the court 's decision is an important step in moving toward a peaceful , democratic resolution that reflects the will of the people , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner had a similar response . " i welcome this independent decision , which opens the way for a repeat of the second round of the election that can fully reflect the will of the ukrainian people , " she said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko -lrb- left -rrb- and viktor yanukovych on wednesday yushchenko -lrb- photo , left -rrb- had insisted that he won the election and complained to the court that his victory was stolen from him through massive election fraud .
the court 's decision made law much of what he had demanded , specifically a repeat of the second , one-against-one vote in a short time . yanokovych backers slam verdict supporters for ukraine 's pro-russia prime minister viktor yanukovych -lrb- photo , right -rrb- however slammed the verdict . " the court effectively played a political role , " said stepan gavrich , a yanukovych representative , according to interfax news agency . it " even went beyond the plaintiff 's appeal -lrb- that -rrb- did not ask for another runoff vote , but had asked to annul results , " he added . there was no immediate comment from yanukovych himself or from outgoing president leonid kuchma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin -lrb- left -rrb- and kuchma during an earlier meeting kuchma , who supported yanukovych , on thursday met russian president vladimir putin and both leaders made clear afterwards that they opposed a re-run only of the yushchenko-versus-yanukovych contest , favoring instead a repeat of the entire election process - a plan vehemently opposed by the opposition . kuchma promised to sack the yanukovych government as demanded by yushchenko following a vote of no-confidence in parliament , but that promise was conditioned on acceptance of a wider kuchma plan to implement controversial political reforms , the fate of which were uncertain after the ruling . russia attacks eu , osce prior to the court 's ruling , lawmakers in neighboring russia fired off another salvo at the west , accusing the european union , the european parliament and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- of fomenting unrest in ukraine that could destabilize the continent . actions by these bodies , the russian state duma said , could lead to " massive disorder , chaos and a split of the country " and " this will have the most negative consequences not only for ukraine but for russia , all of europe and for the international community as a whole . " several pro-russian , russian-speaking parts of eastern and southern ukraine where support for yanukovich was strongest have threatened to seek greater autonomy should yushchenko be installed as ukraine 's next president . one of those regions , donetsk , has already set a date next month for holding a referendum on whether to seek greater autonomy . parliament votes to pull out of iraq as if to highlight the larger stakes in the ukraine political situation , the country 's parliament earlier in the day voted to demand the pullout of the 1,600 ukrainian troops based in iraq as part of the us-led coalition there . the opposition , which has supported such a move , complained that the timing of the parliament 's move was an effort to discredit them . poland , which commands the multinational division in iraq that includes the ukrainian forces , expressed alarm at the vote . but polish defence minister jerzy szmajdzinski , quoted by poland 's pap news agency , said warsaw was for the time being regarding it as a purely political statement pending a decision on it by kuchma . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should ukraine 's elections be repeated ?

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.12.2004 opinion : scare-mongering jeopardizes integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslims in germany feel their religion makes them public pariahs as the german bundestag 's conference on german-arab relations enters its third and final day friday , dw 's rainer sollich looks at how integration of muslims is being complicated by fears of fundamentalism . the " arab world days " saw some 300 representatives from political and cultural institutions in the arab world and europe gather in berlin to focus on issues such as the israeli-palestinian conflict and the fight against fundamentalism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach but amid the calls for greater tolerance and transparency , deputy chairman of the cdu 's parliamentary group wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- proposed deporting muslims suspected of being " potentially violent . " populism ? many would agree that even if the county 's three million muslims include just 3,000 extremists , the state is justified in resorting to extreme protective measures - the same measures it would use against german and non-muslim extremists , such as surveillance by domestic intelligence services and criminal proceedings in the case of proven offences .
crucially , however , anyone without a german passport can theoretically be deported . nonetheless , accusing muslim fundamentalists of being " potentially violent " is far from easy to back up , and hardly constitutes legal grounds for expulsion .
bosbach 's plan to throw some 3,000 suspected extremists out of the country overnight is little more than populism . only those who offend against existing laws can be deported - in other words , anyone who perpetrates violence or anyone who can be proved to have incited violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan after deportation to turkey the case of the " caliph of cologne , " metin kaplan -lrb- pictured -rrb- , a muslim fundamentalist recently deported to turkey after several years of legal wrangling , showed how complicated extradition can be - and how long it can take before the courts reach a binding decision . public pariahs in germany , the question of muslim and turkish integration is linked to the debate about potentially violent fundamentalism to a dangerous extent .
even though politicians across the board are quick to stress that the majority of muslims living in germany are peaceful and law-abiding , public debate descends all too often into a far less differentiated rhetoric . increasingly , muslims feel their religion makes them public pariahs - not a good basis for successful integration .
and a recent study shows that xenophobia is once again on the rise in germany . investing in integration projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in germany often tend to stay among themselves rather than wasting their time with theoretical discussions about what should constitute a " defining " german culture , or " leitkultur , " it 's time politicians used their common sense and invested more funds in integration projects .

" populism ? many would agree that even if the county 's three million muslims include just 3,000 extremists , the state is justified in resorting to extreme protective measures - the same measures it would use against german and non-muslim extremists , such as surveillance by domestic intelligence services and criminal proceedings in the case of proven offences .
crucially , however , anyone without a german passport can theoretically be deported . nonetheless , accusing muslim fundamentalists of being " potentially violent " is far from easy to back up , and hardly constitutes legal grounds for expulsion .
bosbach 's plan to throw some 3,000 suspected extremists out of the country overnight is little more than populism . only those who offend against existing laws can be deported - in other words , anyone who perpetrates violence or anyone who can be proved to have incited violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan after deportation to turkey the case of the " caliph of cologne , " metin kaplan -lrb- pictured -rrb- , a muslim fundamentalist recently deported to turkey after several years of legal wrangling , showed how complicated extradition can be - and how long it can take before the courts reach a binding decision . public pariahs in germany , the question of muslim and turkish integration is linked to the debate about potentially violent fundamentalism to a dangerous extent .
even though politicians across the board are quick to stress that the majority of muslims living in germany are peaceful and law-abiding , public debate descends all too often into a far less differentiated rhetoric . increasingly , muslims feel their religion makes them public pariahs - not a good basis for successful integration .
and a recent study shows that xenophobia is once again on the rise in germany . investing in integration projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish women in germany often tend to stay among themselves rather than wasting their time with theoretical discussions about what should constitute a " defining " german culture , or " leitkultur , " it 's time politicians used their common sense and invested more funds in integration projects .
anyone who wants to help minorities integrate is wasting their time insisting on pledges of allegiance to the german constitution . what they have to do instead is provide education and language courses .
training imams and muslim teachers at german schools , moreover , would not only be one way of reducing the risk of inflammatory preaching in german mosques , it would also be a gesture of recognition to the muslim community . politicians should also stop insisting the country 's muslims distance themselves from fundamentalism and terrorist activity perpetrated in the name of islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-nur mosque in berlin it may seem like a reasonable demand - but what exactly is expected from germany 's mainly turkish muslim community ? should it take to the streets in protest every time a terrorist attack takes place in cairo , riyadh or jakarta ? adding to the problem is the fact germany lacks an organization tasked with representing the majority of muslims .
even if the many rival associations were to join forces , most muslims in germany do n't belong to religious groups - and have little interest in ever changing that . rainer sollich -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these per hour of work officials hope the one-euro jobs are the incentive jobless need to get back in the work force .
at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .
" the people who do n't have a chance in the regular labor force can get a foothold there by working a job like this , " he added .
" they make contacts through these jobs that can lead to something later .

will the move change the habits of a nation of committed smokers ? its a direct hit to the smoker 's pocketbook : the price of cigarettes rose this week in germany by as much as 40 euro cents -lrb- 53 us cents -rrb- a pack .
the second of a projected three-part tobacco-tax increase went into effect on wednesday , and with it came an approximately 2 cent per cigarette increase in the cost of a package .
of that , 1.2 cents is due to the tobacco increase ; the rest goes directly to the individual tobacco companies .
more to come a third round of tax increases is expected to go into effect in september , 2005 .
the increased tax revenues are expected to finance government subsidies for non-typical public health care coverage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has frequently come under criticism for its weak efforts to curb smoking .
compared with many other western european countries , germany has cheaper cigarettes , fewer laws to curb public smoking , less anti-tobacco advertising , and more smoke friendly workplaces .
in other words , germany has been a very smoker-friendly nation .
in a recent study from the european network for smoking prevention , germany ranked in the bottom 10 of 25 countries examined .
a forced change in habits ?
but now , some say the increased prices are a step toward curbing a habit run amok .
the president of the german cancer society , dagmar schipanski , told ap news agency that her organization believes higher cigarette prices lead to less smoking overall .
" the last tax increases are already showing their effects , " she told ap in bonn .
" many people have quit , and more are doing it every day . "
and their information on smoking cessation is in such great demand that " we had to increase our print run , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a poll carried out by the nicorette company - makers of aids to help people quit smoking - germans were asked whether they would try to kick the habit because of a cigarette price hike .
half of the respondents said yes , according to a report on the n-tv television network .
but a smoker not affiliated with any non-smoking products told a different story .
" of course i 'll keep smoking when the prices go up , " horst-walter erpenbach , a cologne-based registered nurse and committed smoker , told dw-world .
" i 'm addicted . "
rather than quit he would simply have to find different ways to deal with the higher prices , he added .
" first i 'll try the cheap no-name brands they sell at -lrb- discount supermarket -rrb- aldi , they are at least 70 cents cheaper than the brand name cigarettes , " he said .
" i can still pay that .
and i know a guy who can get whole cartons of cigarettes for € 20 .
i do n't know where he gets them , i think they come from ukraine or slovakia , but i do n't ask .
somebody knows somebody who gets them .
that 's the way it goes .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .

as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of these per hour of work officials hope the one-euro jobs are the incentive jobless need to get back in the work force .
at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .
" the people who do n't have a chance in the regular labor force can get a foothold there by working a job like this , " he added .
" they make contacts through these jobs that can lead to something later .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .
the terrorists were apprehend based on data taken from mobile phone conversations .
still , those in charge of data protection in germany say they want to proceed cautiously .
question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .
even worse off would be the smaller and mid-size internet companies , who would have to pay as much as € 50 millionen -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- to put the measures into effect .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .

will the move change the habits of a nation of committed smokers ? its a direct hit to the smoker 's pocketbook : the price of cigarettes rose this week in germany by as much as 40 euro cents -lrb- 53 us cents -rrb- a pack .
the second of a projected three-part tobacco-tax increase went into effect on wednesday , and with it came an approximately 2 cent per cigarette increase in the cost of a package .
of that , 1.2 cents is due to the tobacco increase ; the rest goes directly to the individual tobacco companies .
more to come a third round of tax increases is expected to go into effect in september , 2005 .
the increased tax revenues are expected to finance government subsidies for non-typical public health care coverage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has frequently come under criticism for its weak efforts to curb smoking .
compared with many other western european countries , germany has cheaper cigarettes , fewer laws to curb public smoking , less anti-tobacco advertising , and more smoke friendly workplaces .
in other words , germany has been a very smoker-friendly nation .
in a recent study from the european network for smoking prevention , germany ranked in the bottom 10 of 25 countries examined .
a forced change in habits ?
but now , some say the increased prices are a step toward curbing a habit run amok .
the president of the german cancer society , dagmar schipanski , told ap news agency that her organization believes higher cigarette prices lead to less smoking overall .
" the last tax increases are already showing their effects , " she told ap in bonn .
" many people have quit , and more are doing it every day . "
and their information on smoking cessation is in such great demand that " we had to increase our print run , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a poll carried out by the nicorette company - makers of aids to help people quit smoking - germans were asked whether they would try to kick the habit because of a cigarette price hike .
half of the respondents said yes , according to a report on the n-tv television network .
but a smoker not affiliated with any non-smoking products told a different story .
" of course i 'll keep smoking when the prices go up , " horst-walter erpenbach , a cologne-based registered nurse and committed smoker , told dw-world .
" i 'm addicted . "
rather than quit he would simply have to find different ways to deal with the higher prices , he added .
" first i 'll try the cheap no-name brands they sell at -lrb- discount supermarket -rrb- aldi , they are at least 70 cents cheaper than the brand name cigarettes , " he said .
" i can still pay that .
and i know a guy who can get whole cartons of cigarettes for € 20 .
i do n't know where he gets them , i think they come from ukraine or slovakia , but i do n't ask .
somebody knows somebody who gets them .
that 's the way it goes .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .
the terrorists were apprehend based on data taken from mobile phone conversations .
still , those in charge of data protection in germany say they want to proceed cautiously .
question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .
the terrorists were apprehend based on data taken from mobile phone conversations .
still , those in charge of data protection in germany say they want to proceed cautiously .
question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .
even worse off would be the smaller and mid-size internet companies , who would have to pay as much as € 50 millionen -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- to put the measures into effect .
" they would go right out of business , " eichele said dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .

at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .

will the move change the habits of a nation of committed smokers ? its a direct hit to the smoker 's pocketbook : the price of cigarettes rose this week in germany by as much as 40 euro cents -lrb- 53 us cents -rrb- a pack .
the second of a projected three-part tobacco-tax increase went into effect on wednesday , and with it came an approximately 2 cent per cigarette increase in the cost of a package .
of that , 1.2 cents is due to the tobacco increase ; the rest goes directly to the individual tobacco companies .
more to come a third round of tax increases is expected to go into effect in september , 2005 .
the increased tax revenues are expected to finance government subsidies for non-typical public health care coverage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has frequently come under criticism for its weak efforts to curb smoking .
compared with many other western european countries , germany has cheaper cigarettes , fewer laws to curb public smoking , less anti-tobacco advertising , and more smoke friendly workplaces .
in other words , germany has been a very smoker-friendly nation .
in a recent study from the european network for smoking prevention , germany ranked in the bottom 10 of 25 countries examined .
a forced change in habits ?
but now , some say the increased prices are a step toward curbing a habit run amok .
the president of the german cancer society , dagmar schipanski , told ap news agency that her organization believes higher cigarette prices lead to less smoking overall .
" the last tax increases are already showing their effects , " she told ap in bonn .
" many people have quit , and more are doing it every day . "
and their information on smoking cessation is in such great demand that " we had to increase our print run , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a poll carried out by the nicorette company - makers of aids to help people quit smoking - germans were asked whether they would try to kick the habit because of a cigarette price hike .
half of the respondents said yes , according to a report on the n-tv television network .
but a smoker not affiliated with any non-smoking products told a different story .
" of course i 'll keep smoking when the prices go up , " horst-walter erpenbach , a cologne-based registered nurse and committed smoker , told dw-world .
" i 'm addicted . "
rather than quit he would simply have to find different ways to deal with the higher prices , he added .
" first i 'll try the cheap no-name brands they sell at -lrb- discount supermarket -rrb- aldi , they are at least 70 cents cheaper than the brand name cigarettes , " he said .
" i can still pay that .
and i know a guy who can get whole cartons of cigarettes for € 20 .
i do n't know where he gets them , i think they come from ukraine or slovakia , but i do n't ask .
somebody knows somebody who gets them .
that 's the way it goes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 03.12.2004 derby weekend in the bundesliga 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayern munich have lots of reason to celebrate this christmas ?
even though the winter break is fast approaching , the 16th week in the bundesliga features two derbies including one of the fiercest : dortmund vs. schalke .
also , bayern travels to nuremberg for the “ bavarian ” derby . the first leg of the bundesliga is nearing its end .
bayern munich are looking to go into the break with the lead ; the contenders are trying to keep pace .
munich face their northern bavarian neighbor , nuremberg -lrb- actually , in franconia — the nurembergers don ’ t like being called bavarians -rrb- .
felix magath ’ s squad had a stellar november , winning all six of their matches , including a champions league and a german cup contest and jumped to the top of the standings . nuremberg are in 12th place and more concerned with staying in the top division , but there is no reason to believe that they will win this match .
the “ club ” have managed to take home three points against munich only once in their last seven meetings .
one fact that might stand in their favor is slovakian midfielder marek mintal .
he has found the mark 12 times , making him the league ’ s current goal-scoring leader . bayern munich , however , have an arsenal of weapons to beat any opponent : strikers roy makaay , claudio pizarro and super sub paolo guererro .
there ’ s also international midfielder michael ballack . and in the last row , they have germany ’ s number one keeper oliver kahn .
he has shown signs of weakness this season and now has an injured finger to boot .
everyone knows this , including nuremberg ’ s coach wolfgang wolf , who plans to use the injury to his team 's advantage : “ we have to make oliver kahn use both his hands . ” dortmund , schalke : no love lost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red cards are n't so unusual when dortmund and schalke meet .
the hottest match of the weekend takes place on sunday , when bitter rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 meet in westfalen stadion .
there ’ s no love lost between the ruhr area clubs and the latest “ incident ” did not help . it occurred at the management level when schalke ’ s general manager , rudi assauer , offered financial assistance to debt-ridden dortmund in the form of a benefit match .
dortmund ’ s managing director , gerd niebaum , took offense and refused the offer , much to the displeasure of assauer . schalke can afford to be magnanimous to their poor cousins .
dortmund ’ s midfielder tomas rosicky summed up the significance of this match , saying “ for us it is about survival . ”
survival because borussia are just three points away from the relegation zone . schalke , on the other hand , have shot up to second place in the league under coach ralf rangnick .
they are brimming with confidence .
they are hot in the league .

paired up with quality-conscious german consumers , a stiftung warentest product ranking can make or break its success .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 1966 edition of stiftung warentest 's magazine the consumer watchdog organization - comparable to consumer reports in the us or the british standards institute - will turn 40 this weekend .
from a difficult birth , requiring the intercession of then-chancellor konrad adenauer , the group quickly achieved recognition reserved for the likes of bmw or mercedes benz .
a recent poll showed 96 percent of all german adults recognized the stiftung warentest name .
a good stiftung warentest result is much more than just a neutral opinion ; it can be invaluable for the success of a product .
every third german has consulted the results of the organization 's testing at least once .
it is therefore not surprising that top designation of " very good " practically assures high sales volume , whereas the worst grade , " lacking , " all but spells failure in the marketplace .
the aldi factor " if a supplier to -lrb- international supermarket chain -rrb- aldi gets a test result that is less than " good , " it can very quickly lead to a cancelled contract , " stiftung warentest spokeswoman heike van laak said .
example : testers gave paderborn-based stute company 's breakfast juice a bad grade , and aldi cancelled the contract .
the loss to the company was € 5 million -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress uschi glas another example of how a bad rating can affect a product 's sales has recently been making its way through germany 's courts - and its tabloids .
popular television actress uschi glas came out with a line of skincare products stiftung warentest deemed " lacking ; " noting it caused " burning , itching , flaking , redness and pustules " for some testers .
' germany 's sweetheart ' fights back the actress once known as " germany 's sweetheart " came back with a lawsuit , asserting the warentest had a conflict of interest .
at stake : a whole lot of money and the actress 's reputation .
both parties are awaiting the court 's decision .
indeed , stiftung warentest deals routinely with complaints and lawsuits from firms dissatisfied with their product 's ratings .
but the head of the organization , werner brinkmann , says he is proud of his organization 's track record .
stiftung warentest has won most of the lawsuits , although it has settlements as well .
" but we 've never had to pay compensatory damages , " brinkmann noted .
tough job to protect the consumer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattresses are put to tough tests given the organization 's popularity today , it is interesting to note that its creation took an act of legislature and the personal attention of the head of state .
in the beginning , german business lobbied hard and successfully against the creation of an organization that would operate like american consumer testing agencies , which had been around since the 1920s .
the federation of german industries especially fought the idea , arguing that consumers were adequately informed through advertising .
only after adenauer intervened and two courts ruled in favor of comparative product testing was the way cleared for the organization 's founders .

4 , 1964 , the bundestag christened the " corporation for neutral product testing , " which began by testing mechanical sewing machines and puree mixers .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .

1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .

so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .

at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .

german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .

for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .

taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .
" the people who do n't have a chance in the regular labor force can get a foothold there by working a job like this , " he added .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .

question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .

how much state access to telephone and internet data is too much ?
the raging debate takes a new turn as the eu examines an anti-terror proposal that would save data across the board for up to three years . at a meeting of interior and justice ministers on thursday , several eu members suggested allowing unprecedented , wide-ranging access to emails and telephone conversations .
in an unusual coalition , great britain , france , sweden and ireland proposed saving the content of all telecommunications traffic for a period of up to three years .
anti-terror investigators have long been able to trace the details of an individual 's internet use ; the same goes for text messages and telephone and cell phone calls .
but such tracing can only be done when the service providers save the data - in most european countries , a sensitive legal topic .
in germany , data protection law requires telecom and internet service providers to erase its customers ' data after six months at the latest .
but security authorities say this is too soon , at least in terms of fighting terrorism and tracking criminal activity .
they have long pushed for more general , long-term data storage systems .
most are skeptical although eu justice and interior ministers agreed to form a task force on the issue , most member states voiced strong skepticism over the proposal , saying such a scheme would stumble over constitutionality issues and pose an unbearable financial burden for telecommunications firms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries was one of those who spoke out against the measure .
she said she feared such wide-ranging measures would trample constitutional rights , and questioned whether telecom firms could bear the costs associated with saving a wide array of data for as long as three years .
" the recording of telephone connection data is an encroachment on the basic rights , " of german law , zypries told dpa news agency before meeting with her european colleagues in brussels thursday .
catching terrorists zypries did agree that a better exchange of data on cross-border anti-terror law enforcement is needed .
and she acknowledged it would be good to save long term data that could be directly used in law enforcement - although she could n't say how authorities could tell which data that would be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombing of the atocha railway station , madrid proponents of the measure , however , have pointed to the importance of expanding state access to private data in tracking the perpetrators of the bombing attacks in madrid in march .
the terrorists were apprehend based on data taken from mobile phone conversations .
still , those in charge of data protection in germany say they want to proceed cautiously .
question of cost " free and anonymous communication is a prerequisite for democracy , " peter büttgen , spokesman for germany 's federal data protection commission in bonn told the dpa .
he said he doubts the utility of such wide-ranging data storage , but does agree that in the case of concrete suspeicion , investigators should have the right to to search internet records .
for its part , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- argued that the measure would be too expensive .
the cost to large telecommunications firms would be in the hundreds of millions of euros , federation expert christiane eichele said .
even worse off would be the smaller and mid-size internet companies , who would have to pay as much as € 50 millionen -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- to put the measures into effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.12.2004 one euro , one way out of unemployment ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking the first step for those out of work , the government has introduced a new category of low-paying jobs to supplement welfare .
so-called one-euro jobs are supposed to help the long-term unemployed back into the work force .
but will they ? the demand was huge .
a week after the berlin employment agency pro futura began offering one-euro jobs to their clients , they were gone .
that was back in the beginning of october , and project coordinator klaus härtl says they still have a waiting list of more than 700 wanting to take advantage of the short-term government-mandated jobs in elderly homes , schools , and parks .
" the people come out of their homes , they make new contacts , they can communicate , " said härtle , trying to explain the attraction of part-time work to the unemployed .
" they feel needed . "
for the time being , he says , all 155 slots of the part-time work program are filled , but that will change .
people can only work the jobs , handed out by federal employment agencies on a regional basis , for a three to six-month basis .
the program is part of germany 's grander plans to reform its generous social welfare system , and encourage the estimated 1.6 million germans out of work for more than a year to take the first step back into the work force .
from € 1 to full time " they want to make these one-euro jobs as financially unattractive as possible , " said viktor steiner , an economist at the german institute for economic research .
the idea is to eventually " move people from these one euro jobs into the regular work force , " he said .
for decades , germany 's unemployed were often better off receiving government unemployment and welfare checks than entering a low-level job where they would be required to pay health and unemployment insurance out of the meager checks they received each month .
but with 4.25 million germans out of work , according to november figures released thursday , and receiving benefits , the country 's public debt is reaching astronomical figures .
to keep the system from collapsing the government last year agreed on a set of reforms that would trim down germany 's generous welfare system and cut payments to those who do n't take on work .

at the moment , there are 19,500 being offered through the federal labor office .
german economics minister wolfgang clement said that number will eventually increase to 600,000 .
short-term work , long-term solution the jobs are intended to top up the welfare checks they already get each month , but not as regular work .
participants are only allowed to work from 15 to 30 hours a week , and for no longer than three months to six months .
at a rate of around € 1 -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- to € 3 an hour , they earn a maximum of € 180 each month to supplement their government aid .
for the time being , they are voluntary .
but when jan .
1 rolls around , those out of work will begin facing cuts in their unemployment checks if they do n't take on available jobs .
for them , the one-euro jobs might be a good transition , according to officials and organizations like pro futura .
" i think that 's a bit optimistic , " steiner said .
as long as people receive their welfare checks , and a bit on top from their one-euro job , they earn more than they would in a regular job that requires them to pay unemployment and health insurance , he added .
" the question is if they succeed in landing a job that will give them enough of an income , " to get off welfare , he said .
taking the first steps the path to that job often begins with getting up off the couch and working , even just part time , helping school children read or cleaning up garbage in the park , härtl said .
" the people who do n't have a chance in the regular labor force can get a foothold there by working a job like this , " he added .

the company , whose chips power most of the world 's pcs , said it expected sales of $ 9.3bn-9.5bn -lrb- £ 4.8bn-4.9bn -rrb- for the three months ending 25 december .
the forecast is far above both intel 's previous prediction of $ 8.6bn-9.2bn , and its all-time record of $ 8.74bn.
after poor news such as a high-profile chip cancellation , the figures prompted a surge in demand for intel shares .
in " grey market " trading after wall street closed , intel rose 7 % .
margins the company 's stock has fallen 29 % since the start of this year , as bigger inventories and more competition from rival amd have taken their toll .
worries about whether the holiday season - traditionally the peak time for consumer computer buying - would prove a bust have also weighed on the firm 's prospects .
and analysts are still watching 2005 , for which the firm made no predictions , for signs that demand for low-end chips will eat into margins and profits .
that said , the chance of a " record quarter and a record year " as chief financial officer andy bryant put it prompted an enthusiastic response from some investors .
" i 'm ecstatic , " said harry papp at l roy papp and associates .
" this tells me end-user demand is healthy . "

it received a 6.3 % per cent increase , its highest for eight years .
the council received the largest local authority increase of any in the county , up by £ 24m to £ 409m .
but it says £ 19.5m of that is ring-fenced for schools and it is between £ 20m and £ 25m short of what it needs to maintain spending in other areas .
amenities protected exeter mp ben bradshaw says the county 's settlement is " welcome and generous " and there was no excuse for a large council tax increase .
plymouth city council is refusing to speculate on next year 's council tax rises .
an extra £ 8m was announced for the city as part of the government 's contribution to the council 's budget .
the 4 % increase will bring its grant up to £ 204.4m but torbay council says it is likely to go ahead with about 100 job losses following the government 's provisional settlement .
despite it getting an increase of 5.5 % , bringing its grant up to £ 99m , the council says there will also be cuts to services and that council tax is likely to rise by about 5 % .
but council leader chris harris said amenities which affected the tourism industry would be protected , such as public toilets and street cleaning .
devon fire service has a 2.6 % increase and the devon and cornwall police authority a 3.75 % rise .

newspaper photographer geoff charles left an extraordinary 120,000 images to the national library of wales , when he died , aged 93 , in 2002 .
the book , cymru geoff charles , has been put together by a former colleague , who would work on stories with mr charles .
the collection , which covers his life 's work over 50 years , will be launched in aberystwyth on friday .
ioan roberts first worked with mr charles , from brymbo , wrexham , on the welsh language newspaper , y cymro .
the geoff charles collection is a unique record of welsh life wil troughton , the national library of wales ioan roberts said : " i was a young reporter starting out on my career on y cymro when i first met geoff in 1969 .
he became my constant driving companion while on the trail of a story .
" people may not be aware but he was also a qualified journalist and was fascinated by people and their history .
he had an innate feeling for what made a good story and in turn what made a good photograph .
" he was aware even when i was working with him all those years ago that he was photographing history - this was of great importance for him and what made him different from other photographers of his era .
" he was also an excellent cataloguer , but with over 120,000 images to choose from within the national library 's collection in aberystwyth , the task of compiling this book was never going to be easy . "
the earliest image in the book is from 1934 of the gresford mining disaster , near wrexham , while the most recent photograph included was taken in 1984 at the national eisteddfod in lampeter .
the publishers have said that much of the collection featured in the book , reflects an era now lost forever following the gradual decline of traditional ways of life and shifts in rural and industrial communities over the last 50 years .
wil troughton , the national library 's visual images librarian , said : " the geoff charles collection is a unique record of welsh life and today his archive is one of the treasures of the national library of wales .
" cymru geoff charles is the product of many years of painstaking research by ioan roberts and y lolfa and is a fitting testament to geoff 's work and his legacy to current and future generations . "

at newcastle crown court mr justice moses told bodybuilder david bieber , 38 , that he must spend the rest of his life in prison .
the former us marine was convicted on thursday of the murder of pc ian broadhurst , who was shot at point blank range in leeds on boxing day 2003 .
he was also given life sentences for the attempted murders of two of pc broadhurst 's colleagues .
the bodybuilder was given concurrent life sentences with a minimum of eight years for the attempted murders of pcs roper and banks .
' cool and detached ' bieber had fled to the uk after he was wanted in the us for conspiracy to commit murder .
he started a new life using the alias nathan coleman .
jailing him , justice moses told bieber he had shown " no remorse or understanding of the brutality " of his crime .
pc ian broadhurst valued officer paid with his life the judge said bieber had continued to maintain a cool and detached approach when attempting to explain the evidence against him .
he told the court the aggravating feature in the case was that bieber did not need to shoot pc broadhurst through the head .
an audio recording of the shooting was played to the jury during the trial .
pc ian broadhurst was heard to plead for his life before being shot in the head .
justice moses said : " you had already disabled him and he was defenceless .
" you could have escaped then , but you chose to wait and fire a second shot at point-blank range .
" it must be acknowledged that he might have died as a result of your first shot , but you made certain of his death . "
trained gunman the judge said that action meant bieber could not be released early from jail and must spend his life in prison .
he has become one of only 25 people to be given " whole " life sentences in england and wales .
others have included harold shipman , myra hindley and jeremy bamber .
bieber had claimed a friend of his , a fellow us national from florida , was the gunman .
but the former marine , who had trained with handguns and assault rifles for a year before being discharged , refused to name the man in court .

by joe boyle bbc news american bodybuilder david bieber fled the us in 1996 with a fake passport after being implicated in the murder of his wife 's lover .
eight years later , with british residency , he is beginning a life sentence for killing a police constable in leeds .
bieber used the identity of nathan coleman to evade capture how did the british authorities let him slip through the net ?
is there any way to prevent the same thing happening again ?
bieber married a british woman in march 1997 , weeks before his six-month tourist visa was due to expire .
home office checks on his background failed to spot that his pseudonym , nathan coleman , belonged to a boy who had died decades earlier .
it seems us authorities had not alerted interpol or the british police that bieber could have left the country .
" if you are going to have immigration - and immigration can not be stopped - then there are going to be cracks in the system , " says randall hansen of newcastle university .
he argues that the immigration system can not root out every bad person who comes into the country .
but professor hansen says bieber may have escaped close attention because he comes from the united states .
he said : " he has come from a country from which there is no immigration pressure .
if you were to look at every single case like this it would prove very intrusive , expensive and difficult .
" so the home office must pay attention to countries where there is a great deal of immigration , like pakistan , india and bangladesh . "
family formation foreign nationals hoping to come to britain legally can enter the country as tourists , students , asylum seekers , workers , or by way of " family formation " or reunion .
david bieber secured his residency through family formation - by marrying a british woman .
of the 140,000 immigrants to the uk in 2003 , 47 % fell into the same category as bieber .
those determined to commit crime are obviously very difficult to root out .
the truth of this was borne out in 2000 when texan pensioner robert kleasen was found with a cache of arms in a cottage in barton-upon-humber in lincolnshire .
kleasen was facing extradition proceedings when he died in 2003 kleasen , it transpired , was wanted in the us for the gruesome double murder of two mormon missionaries in a taxidermist 's shop during the 1970s .
he had fled the us in 1990 after serving a jail sentence for other firearms offences .
the following year he married and gained uk residency - the same as bieber .
but shona mcisaac , the lincolnshire mp who brought kleasen to the attention of the home office , sees no similarity between the cases .
she says the issue with kleasen was not identity , but the fact that he was allowed membership to gun clubs .
she said : " after i brought kleasen to the attention of the then home secretary , jack straw , the law was changed with regards to allowing foreign nationals membership to gun clubs .
" if he -lsb- bieber -rsb- was using a false identity , then that is a very difficult case . "
adequate checks ?
so far , no-one is really sure how a tragedy like bieber 's could have been prevented .
ms mcisaac did not want to speculate .
prof hansen suggests that home office checks into his marriage were not thorough enough .
the home office was asked to detail the checks they made on bieber , or on any foreign national marrying in the uk , but they were unable to respond .
bieber claimed a friend had murdered the police constable fabian hamilton , mp for leeds north east , the constituency in which bieber lived , also offered no quick solutions .
" you ca n't blame the authorities for not having discovered him .
he was a ruthless man who was willing to go to any lengths to evade capture , " said the leeds mp .
mr hamilton does n't believe better immigration checks or more up-to-date technology would necessarily have helped either .
instead , he offered the suggestion of better co-operation between police forces .
" if this man was wanted for murder in the us , and it was clear he had disappeared and perhaps left the country , you would think that the police would notify interpol - or even the british police .

by joe boyle bbc news american bodybuilder david bieber fled the us in 1996 with a fake passport after being implicated in the murder of his wife 's lover .
eight years later , with british residency , he is beginning a life sentence for killing a police constable in leeds .
bieber used the identity of nathan coleman to evade capture how did the british authorities let him slip through the net ?
is there any way to prevent the same thing happening again ?
bieber married a british woman in march 1997 , weeks before his six-month tourist visa was due to expire .
home office checks on his background failed to spot that his pseudonym , nathan coleman , belonged to a boy who had died decades earlier .
it seems us authorities had not alerted interpol or the british police that bieber could have left the country .
" if you are going to have immigration - and immigration can not be stopped - then there are going to be cracks in the system , " says randall hansen of newcastle university .
he argues that the immigration system can not root out every bad person who comes into the country .
but professor hansen says bieber may have escaped close attention because he comes from the united states .
he said : " he has come from a country from which there is no immigration pressure .
if you were to look at every single case like this it would prove very intrusive , expensive and difficult .
" so the home office must pay attention to countries where there is a great deal of immigration , like pakistan , india and bangladesh . "
family formation foreign nationals hoping to come to britain legally can enter the country as tourists , students , asylum seekers , workers , or by way of " family formation " or reunion .
david bieber secured his residency through family formation - by marrying a british woman .
of the 140,000 immigrants to the uk in 2003 , 47 % fell into the same category as bieber .
those determined to commit crime are obviously very difficult to root out .
the truth of this was borne out in 2000 when texan pensioner robert kleasen was found with a cache of arms in a cottage in barton-upon-humber in lincolnshire .
kleasen was facing extradition proceedings when he died in 2003 kleasen , it transpired , was wanted in the us for the gruesome double murder of two mormon missionaries in a taxidermist 's shop during the 1970s .
he had fled the us in 1990 after serving a jail sentence for other firearms offences .
the following year he married and gained uk residency - the same as bieber .
but shona mcisaac , the lincolnshire mp who brought kleasen to the attention of the home office , sees no similarity between the cases .
she says the issue with kleasen was not identity , but the fact that he was allowed membership to gun clubs .
she said : " after i brought kleasen to the attention of the then home secretary , jack straw , the law was changed with regards to allowing foreign nationals membership to gun clubs .
" if he -lsb- bieber -rsb- was using a false identity , then that is a very difficult case . "
adequate checks ?
so far , no-one is really sure how a tragedy like bieber 's could have been prevented .
ms mcisaac did not want to speculate .
prof hansen suggests that home office checks into his marriage were not thorough enough .
the home office was asked to detail the checks they made on bieber , or on any foreign national marrying in the uk , but they were unable to respond .
bieber claimed a friend had murdered the police constable fabian hamilton , mp for leeds north east , the constituency in which bieber lived , also offered no quick solutions .
" you ca n't blame the authorities for not having discovered him .
he was a ruthless man who was willing to go to any lengths to evade capture , " said the leeds mp .
mr hamilton does n't believe better immigration checks or more up-to-date technology would necessarily have helped either .
instead , he offered the suggestion of better co-operation between police forces .

of the 140,000 immigrants to the uk in 2003 , 47 % fell into the same category as bieber .
those determined to commit crime are obviously very difficult to root out .
the truth of this was borne out in 2000 when texan pensioner robert kleasen was found with a cache of arms in a cottage in barton-upon-humber in lincolnshire .
kleasen , it transpired , was wanted in the us for the gruesome double murder of two mormon missionaries in a taxidermist 's shop during the 1970s .
he had fled the us in 1990 after serving a jail sentence for other firearms offences .
the following year he married and gained uk residency - the same as bieber .
but shona mcisaac , the lincolnshire mp who brought kleasen to the attention of the home office , sees no similarity between the cases .
she says the issue with kleasen was not identity , but the fact that he was allowed membership to gun clubs .
she said : " after i brought kleasen to the attention of the then home secretary , jack straw , the law was changed with regards to allowing foreign nationals membership to gun clubs .
" if he -lsb- bieber -rsb- was using a false identity , then that is a very difficult case . "
adequate checks ?
so far , no-one is really sure how a tragedy like bieber 's could have been prevented .
ms mcisaac did not want to speculate .
prof hansen suggests that home office checks into his marriage were not thorough enough .
the home office was asked to detail the checks they made on bieber , or on any foreign national marrying in the uk , but they were unable to respond .
fabian hamilton , mp for leeds north east , the constituency in which bieber lived , also offered no quick solutions .
" you ca n't blame the authorities for not having discovered him .
he was a ruthless man who was willing to go to any lengths to evade capture , " said the leeds mp .
mr hamilton does n't believe better immigration checks or more up-to-date technology would necessarily have helped either .
instead , he offered the suggestion of better co-operation between police forces .
" if this man was wanted for murder in the us , and it was clear he had disappeared and perhaps left the country , you would think that the police would notify interpol - or even the british police .
" after all , the obvious place for an american to come would be the uk . "

whether they are selling us knickers or fronting a charity campaign , they are in demand because , just like a top brand of soup or a leading mobile phone , they are instantly recognisable .
but how do they achieve this and can the rest of us employ a similar tactic to cash in ?
decide on your brand according to personal branding consultant gabriella goddard , celebrities build up their brands by sticking to a few key attributes they want to be known for and making sure everything they do reinforces the image .
you can be the best-kept secret in your department unless you do something about it gabriella goddard for the beckhams , it is sporting and pop achievement combined with wealth and glamour and the perception of a perfect family life .
these are qualities many people aspire to , making their brand a powerful selling tool .
but even in " normal " careers , working on your personal brand can reap dividends in terms of business success or climbing the corporate ladder .
this does not mean you need a brand name , branded stationary or advertising about yourself , just a clear idea in your own mind of how you want to be seen .
if you can put across a clear message about what qualities you are " selling " , you are more likely to be hired or promoted .
first , ms goddard says , it is important to decide what makes you different and what you want to be known for .
then you can concentrate on making sure everyone associates you with those qualities .
you might want to be seen as a stylish and innovative artist , or as an authoritative and decisive manager .
it is a good idea to focus on any particular area of expertise you have , or anything you are passionate about .
if you are not sure what makes you different , ask for feedback from friends and colleagues to find out how others see you .
get noticed some celebs come from nowhere and enter the public eye through chance , by being in the right place at the right time , or through reality shows .
for others , such as britney spears , fame followed years of hard work , taking part in contests and promoting themselves before they achieved their goal .
raising your brand profile is just as important in office life .
as ms goddard puts it : " you can be the best-kept secret in your department unless you do something about it . "
she suggests networking , making contacts in other firms and departments , joining trade organisations and maybe writing articles for trade journals on your field of expertise to help promote yourself whenever you can .
the internet can also be a good place to start showcasing work and building a fan base , for those starting out .
other ways to promote yourself include taking part in charity events , trying to get publicity through local media , doing work experience and voluntary work .
walk the talk j-lo 's brand covers everything from singing to underwear once you 've decided what you want to be known for , you need to start reinforcing your brand by being consistent and " walking the talk " .
ms goddard says : " through circumstance you get visibility and from there you create recognition .
and if you are consistent , the brand comes across .
" simon cowell , for example , is very consistent .
his brand is built on his abrupt personality as well as his expertise , so if he suddenly became ' nice ' it would ruin it .
" whatever your brand is , you need to paint everything you do with that brush . "
for celebrities , this includes being careful what products you let yourself be associated with .
ms goddard , who spent 15 years developing international product brands before moving into personal branding , says : " they need to be thinking , ' what kind of things should my brand be endorsing ?
am i more of a virgin atlantic person or an easyjet person ? " '
for the rest of us , decisions on where to be seen , what accessories to choose and even what mobile phone to buy can all help .
it is also important to act professional , with business cards at the ready , and to dress the part .
if you are in banking , for example , but want to be known for your zany personality , then you could consider a pin-stripe suit with funky earrings or glasses .
ms goddard even sends some clients to voice coaching , to help them sound more authoritative or confident , or to posture experts to help them stand , sit and walk in the right way .
take advantage kylie has evolved with the times fame can be fickle , so the challenge is to make the most of your time in the limelight .
ms goddard says : " the smart celebrities have businesses which they run as well , to keep the income flowing and give their visibility some leverage .
" if you 've got something people want to aspire to , then you might as well exploit that . "
the queen of this approach is jennifer lopez , who is now a singer , and actress , has her own perfume range and her own clothing , underwear and accessories lines .
ms goddard describes her as an " uber-brand " .
" when you think of the j-lo brand , you expect something to be fresh and a bit sassy , " she says .
ms goddard suggests x-factor presenter sharon osborne could be another big brand in waiting .
she says : " when you think of her , what do you think of ?
" she 's a woman who says what she thinks , calls a spade a spade , and she 's loyal and nurturing and very genuine .
" if she wanted to create , say , a beauty range for the over-40s , and maybe call it something like ' fabulous ' , when people bought it , they 'd expect it to really do what it said on the bottle , because that 's what sharon 's like .
" they would expect it to make them feel fabulous , plus it 's aspirational , because if sharon can do it , so can anyone . "
similarly , if you 've made a name for yourself in one field , it might be worth using that success to help yourself start up a business of your own .
evolve with the times it 's all about getting noticed ms goddard says : " high profile people reinvent themselves every few years because their value depends on their visibility . "
" it 's a bit like the auto industry , which is always coming up with new models to stay ahead . "
stars who get pigeonholed , such as britney or charlotte church , tend to rebel after a while , as they change as people .
others , such as madonna or kylie minogue , have managed the process more smoothly .
most of us will also need to help our brands evolve .
the image that was right for a 22-year-old starting out in their career may not be right for the same person 15 years later , when they might be going for a senior manager 's job .
at this stage , ms goddard advises building up a different aspect of your brand , playing up the skills you might need in your new job .
" just like madonna and kylie , you have to keep up with the market and also how you are changing over time .
" for example , you might get married or become a parent , which will make you feel different , so you 'll behave differently .
growth is good . "

whether they are selling us knickers or fronting a charity campaign , they are in demand because , just like a top brand of soup or a leading mobile phone , they are instantly recognisable .
but how do they achieve this and can the rest of us employ a similar tactic to cash in ?
decide on your brand according to personal branding consultant gabriella goddard , celebrities build up their brands by sticking to a few key attributes they want to be known for and making sure everything they do reinforces the image .
you can be the best-kept secret in your department unless you do something about it gabriella goddard for the beckhams , it is sporting and pop achievement combined with wealth and glamour and the perception of a perfect family life .
these are qualities many people aspire to , making their brand a powerful selling tool .
but even in " normal " careers , working on your personal brand can reap dividends in terms of business success or climbing the corporate ladder .
this does not mean you need a brand name , branded stationary or advertising about yourself , just a clear idea in your own mind of how you want to be seen .
if you can put across a clear message about what qualities you are " selling " , you are more likely to be hired or promoted .
first , ms goddard says , it is important to decide what makes you different and what you want to be known for .
then you can concentrate on making sure everyone associates you with those qualities .
you might want to be seen as a stylish and innovative artist , or as an authoritative and decisive manager .
it is a good idea to focus on any particular area of expertise you have , or anything you are passionate about .
if you are not sure what makes you different , ask for feedback from friends and colleagues to find out how others see you .
get noticed some celebs come from nowhere and enter the public eye through chance , by being in the right place at the right time , or through reality shows .
for others , such as britney spears , fame followed years of hard work , taking part in contests and promoting themselves before they achieved their goal .
raising your brand profile is just as important in office life .
as ms goddard puts it : " you can be the best-kept secret in your department unless you do something about it . "
she suggests networking , making contacts in other firms and departments , joining trade organisations and maybe writing articles for trade journals on your field of expertise to help promote yourself whenever you can .
the internet can also be a good place to start showcasing work and building a fan base , for those starting out .
other ways to promote yourself include taking part in charity events , trying to get publicity through local media , doing work experience and voluntary work .
walk the talk j-lo 's brand covers everything from singing to underwear once you 've decided what you want to be known for , you need to start reinforcing your brand by being consistent and " walking the talk " .
ms goddard says : " through circumstance you get visibility and from there you create recognition .
and if you are consistent , the brand comes across .
" simon cowell , for example , is very consistent .
his brand is built on his abrupt personality as well as his expertise , so if he suddenly became ' nice ' it would ruin it .
" whatever your brand is , you need to paint everything you do with that brush . "
for celebrities , this includes being careful what products you let yourself be associated with .
ms goddard , who spent 15 years developing international product brands before moving into personal branding , says : " they need to be thinking , ' what kind of things should my brand be endorsing ?
am i more of a virgin atlantic person or an easyjet person ? " '
for the rest of us , decisions on where to be seen , what accessories to choose and even what mobile phone to buy can all help .
it is also important to act professional , with business cards at the ready , and to dress the part .
if you are in banking , for example , but want to be known for your zany personality , then you could consider a pin-stripe suit with funky earrings or glasses .
ms goddard even sends some clients to voice coaching , to help them sound more authoritative or confident , or to posture experts to help them stand , sit and walk in the right way .
take advantage kylie has evolved with the times fame can be fickle , so the challenge is to make the most of your time in the limelight .
ms goddard says : " the smart celebrities have businesses which they run as well , to keep the income flowing and give their visibility some leverage .
" if you 've got something people want to aspire to , then you might as well exploit that . "
the queen of this approach is jennifer lopez , who is now a singer , and actress , has her own perfume range and her own clothing , underwear and accessories lines .
ms goddard describes her as an " uber-brand " .
" when you think of the j-lo brand , you expect something to be fresh and a bit sassy , " she says .
ms goddard suggests x-factor presenter sharon osborne could be another big brand in waiting .
she says : " when you think of her , what do you think of ?
" she 's a woman who says what she thinks , calls a spade a spade , and she 's loyal and nurturing and very genuine .
" if she wanted to create , say , a beauty range for the over-40s , and maybe call it something like ' fabulous ' , when people bought it , they 'd expect it to really do what it said on the bottle , because that 's what sharon 's like .
" they would expect it to make them feel fabulous , plus it 's aspirational , because if sharon can do it , so can anyone . "
similarly , if you 've made a name for yourself in one field , it might be worth using that success to help yourself start up a business of your own .
evolve with the times it 's all about getting noticed ms goddard says : " high profile people reinvent themselves every few years because their value depends on their visibility . "
" it 's a bit like the auto industry , which is always coming up with new models to stay ahead . "
stars who get pigeonholed , such as britney or charlotte church , tend to rebel after a while , as they change as people .
others , such as madonna or kylie minogue , have managed the process more smoothly .
most of us will also need to help our brands evolve .
the image that was right for a 22-year-old starting out in their career may not be right for the same person 15 years later , when they might be going for a senior manager 's job .
at this stage , ms goddard advises building up a different aspect of your brand , playing up the skills you might need in your new job .
" just like madonna and kylie , you have to keep up with the market and also how you are changing over time .
" for example , you might get married or become a parent , which will make you feel different , so you 'll behave differently .
growth is good . "

whether they are selling us knickers or fronting a charity campaign , they are in demand because , just like a top brand of soup or a leading mobile phone , they are instantly recognisable .
but how do they achieve this and can the rest of us employ a similar tactic to cash in ?
decide on your brand according to personal branding consultant gabriella goddard , celebrities build up their brands by sticking to a few key attributes they want to be known for and making sure everything they do reinforces the image .
you can be the best-kept secret in your department unless you do something about it gabriella goddard for the beckhams , it is sporting and pop achievement combined with wealth and glamour and the perception of a perfect family life .
these are qualities many people aspire to , making their brand a powerful selling tool .
but even in " normal " careers , working on your personal brand can reap dividends in terms of business success or climbing the corporate ladder .
this does not mean you need a brand name , branded stationary or advertising about yourself , just a clear idea in your own mind of how you want to be seen .
if you can put across a clear message about what qualities you are " selling " , you are more likely to be hired or promoted .
first , ms goddard says , it is important to decide what makes you different and what you want to be known for .
then you can concentrate on making sure everyone associates you with those qualities .
you might want to be seen as a stylish and innovative artist , or as an authoritative and decisive manager .
it is a good idea to focus on any particular area of expertise you have , or anything you are passionate about .
if you are not sure what makes you different , ask for feedback from friends and colleagues to find out how others see you .
get noticed some celebs come from nowhere and enter the public eye through chance , by being in the right place at the right time , or through reality shows .
for others , such as britney spears , fame followed years of hard work , taking part in contests and promoting themselves before they achieved their goal .
raising your brand profile is just as important in office life .
as ms goddard puts it : " you can be the best-kept secret in your department unless you do something about it . "
she suggests networking , making contacts in other firms and departments , joining trade organisations and maybe writing articles for trade journals on your field of expertise to help promote yourself whenever you can .
the internet can also be a good place to start showcasing work and building a fan base , for those starting out .
other ways to promote yourself include taking part in charity events , trying to get publicity through local media , doing work experience and voluntary work .
walk the talk j-lo 's brand covers everything from singing to underwear once you 've decided what you want to be known for , you need to start reinforcing your brand by being consistent and " walking the talk " .
ms goddard says : " through circumstance you get visibility and from there you create recognition .
and if you are consistent , the brand comes across .
" simon cowell , for example , is very consistent .
his brand is built on his abrupt personality as well as his expertise , so if he suddenly became ' nice ' it would ruin it .
" whatever your brand is , you need to paint everything you do with that brush . "
for celebrities , this includes being careful what products you let yourself be associated with .
ms goddard , who spent 15 years developing international product brands before moving into personal branding , says : " they need to be thinking , ' what kind of things should my brand be endorsing ?
am i more of a virgin atlantic person or an easyjet person ? " '
for the rest of us , decisions on where to be seen , what accessories to choose and even what mobile phone to buy can all help .
it is also important to act professional , with business cards at the ready , and to dress the part .
if you are in banking , for example , but want to be known for your zany personality , then you could consider a pin-stripe suit with funky earrings or glasses .
ms goddard even sends some clients to voice coaching , to help them sound more authoritative or confident , or to posture experts to help them stand , sit and walk in the right way .
take advantage kylie has evolved with the times fame can be fickle , so the challenge is to make the most of your time in the limelight .
ms goddard says : " the smart celebrities have businesses which they run as well , to keep the income flowing and give their visibility some leverage .
" if you 've got something people want to aspire to , then you might as well exploit that . "
the queen of this approach is jennifer lopez , who is now a singer , and actress , has her own perfume range and her own clothing , underwear and accessories lines .
ms goddard describes her as an " uber-brand " .
" when you think of the j-lo brand , you expect something to be fresh and a bit sassy , " she says .
ms goddard suggests x-factor presenter sharon osborne could be another big brand in waiting .
she says : " when you think of her , what do you think of ?
" she 's a woman who says what she thinks , calls a spade a spade , and she 's loyal and nurturing and very genuine .
" if she wanted to create , say , a beauty range for the over-40s , and maybe call it something like ' fabulous ' , when people bought it , they 'd expect it to really do what it said on the bottle , because that 's what sharon 's like .
" they would expect it to make them feel fabulous , plus it 's aspirational , because if sharon can do it , so can anyone . "
similarly , if you 've made a name for yourself in one field , it might be worth using that success to help yourself start up a business of your own .
evolve with the times it 's all about getting noticed ms goddard says : " high profile people reinvent themselves every few years because their value depends on their visibility . "
" it 's a bit like the auto industry , which is always coming up with new models to stay ahead . "
stars who get pigeonholed , such as britney or charlotte church , tend to rebel after a while , as they change as people .
others , such as madonna or kylie minogue , have managed the process more smoothly .
most of us will also need to help our brands evolve .
the image that was right for a 22-year-old starting out in their career may not be right for the same person 15 years later , when they might be going for a senior manager 's job .
at this stage , ms goddard advises building up a different aspect of your brand , playing up the skills you might need in your new job .
" just like madonna and kylie , you have to keep up with the market and also how you are changing over time .
" for example , you might get married or become a parent , which will make you feel different , so you 'll behave differently .
growth is good . "
