throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future . " nato is going through a very important process of transformation and adaptation to new circumstances , " the 55-year old dutch former foreign minister said ahead of taking over the helm from robertson on jan .
5 .
after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .
as head of the military alliance , the integration of lithuania , latvia , estonia , romania , bulgaria , slovenia and slovaka , will be one of de hoop scheffer ’ s primary tasks in 2004 .
at the same time nato expands to include the former eastern european states , de hoop scheffer will have to shore up the current members ’ sense of trust after the damaging break-up over iraq .
in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .
" my advice would be focus again on the capabilities , " robertson said before stepping down last month .

throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

jaap de hoop scheffer is the third dutchman to head nato .
while supporters praise the former foreign minister for his diplomatic skill at forging compromises , others criticize him for not taking a critical stance . former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to de hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , so careful was his maneuvering on the diplomatic tightropes .
indeed , the 55-year old is frequently referred to as a skillful statesman , who succeeds in forging compromises where the majority of his colleagues fail .
supporters in the netherlands and europe say those are qualities the new nato secretary general will need when he takes over the helm in 2004 .
" he is , at the end of the day , more of a diplomat than a politician , " fellow christian democrat wim van de camp was quoted by radio netherlands as saying .
" he is not particularly outspoken on any issue .
he has a lot of patience and that is necessary on the international scene . "

not everyone embraces the dutchman ’ s sense of careful-worded diplomacy .
in europe , his appointment was viewed more as a safe choice at a time when the alliance was torn apart over the iraq war than as the best person to guide the alliance into the future .
france in particular was critical of de hoop scheffer ’ s middle-of-the road position on the u.s.-led war .
on the one hand , as dutch foreign minister he extended political support to washington for the ouster of saddam hussein , but on the other hand he held back offering military assistance .
one of his more outspoken critics is ex-european central bank president wim duisenberg .
" i understand very well why jaap de hoop scheffer has now become secretary general of nato ...

de hoop scheffer has served as dutch foreign minister in two center-right coalitions , and although many back home say he lacks the charisma to rise higher in his country ’ s government , diplomats in brussels say he is well-liked .

after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .

in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.01.2004 oriental tradition catches on in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water pipes are becoming popular in germany .
throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .

water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .

throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .

a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future . " nato is going through a very important process of transformation and adaptation to new circumstances , " the 55-year old dutch former foreign minister said ahead of taking over the helm from robertson on jan .
5 .
after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .
as head of the military alliance , the integration of lithuania , latvia , estonia , romania , bulgaria , slovenia and slovaka , will be one of de hoop scheffer ’ s primary tasks in 2004 .
at the same time nato expands to include the former eastern european states , de hoop scheffer will have to shore up the current members ’ sense of trust after the damaging break-up over iraq .
in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .

jaap de hoop scheffer is the third dutchman to head nato .
while supporters praise the former foreign minister for his diplomatic skill at forging compromises , others criticize him for not taking a critical stance . former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to de hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , so careful was his maneuvering on the diplomatic tightropes .
indeed , the 55-year old is frequently referred to as a skillful statesman , who succeeds in forging compromises where the majority of his colleagues fail .
supporters in the netherlands and europe say those are qualities the new nato secretary general will need when he takes over the helm in 2004 .
" he is , at the end of the day , more of a diplomat than a politician , " fellow christian democrat wim van de camp was quoted by radio netherlands as saying .
" he is not particularly outspoken on any issue .
he has a lot of patience and that is necessary on the international scene . "
de hoop scheffer also won praise from other foreign ministers for the dutch chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe in 2003 .

not everyone embraces the dutchman ’ s sense of careful-worded diplomacy .
in europe , his appointment was viewed more as a safe choice at a time when the alliance was torn apart over the iraq war than as the best person to guide the alliance into the future .
france in particular was critical of de hoop scheffer ’ s middle-of-the road position on the u.s.-led war .
on the one hand , as dutch foreign minister he extended political support to washington for the ouster of saddam hussein , but on the other hand he held back offering military assistance .
one of his more outspoken critics is ex-european central bank president wim duisenberg .
" i understand very well why jaap de hoop scheffer has now become secretary general of nato ...
he is someone who in his deeds and words follows the united states practically without criticism , " duisenberg told the dutch daily nrc in december .

de hoop scheffer has served as dutch foreign minister in two center-right coalitions , and although many back home say he lacks the charisma to rise higher in his country ’ s government , diplomats in brussels say he is well-liked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.01.2004 dutchman steers nato through new challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch foreign minister jaap de hoop scheffer takes over at nato on monday jaap de hoop scheffer succeeds george robertson as nato ’ s secretary general .
a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future . " nato is going through a very important process of transformation and adaptation to new circumstances , " the 55-year old dutch former foreign minister said ahead of taking over the helm from robertson on jan .
5 .
after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .
as head of the military alliance , the integration of lithuania , latvia , estonia , romania , bulgaria , slovenia and slovaka , will be one of de hoop scheffer ’ s primary tasks in 2004 .
at the same time nato expands to include the former eastern european states , de hoop scheffer will have to shore up the current members ’ sense of trust after the damaging break-up over iraq .
in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .
" my advice would be focus again on the capabilities , " robertson said before stepping down last month .
" if we become a noise box with no ability to act , we will wither and die .

but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "

a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future . " nato is going through a very important process of transformation and adaptation to new circumstances , " the 55-year old dutch former foreign minister said ahead of taking over the helm from robertson on jan .
5 .
after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .
as head of the military alliance , the integration of lithuania , latvia , estonia , romania , bulgaria , slovenia and slovaka , will be one of de hoop scheffer ’ s primary tasks in 2004 .
at the same time nato expands to include the former eastern european states , de hoop scheffer will have to shore up the current members ’ sense of trust after the damaging break-up over iraq .
in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .

throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

supporters in the netherlands and europe say those are qualities the new nato secretary general will need when he takes over the helm in 2004 .
" he is , at the end of the day , more of a diplomat than a politician , " fellow christian democrat wim van de camp was quoted by radio netherlands as saying .
" he is not particularly outspoken on any issue .
he has a lot of patience and that is necessary on the international scene . "

in europe , his appointment was viewed more as a safe choice at a time when the alliance was torn apart over the iraq war than as the best person to guide the alliance into the future .

de hoop scheffer has served as dutch foreign minister in two center-right coalitions , and although many back home say he lacks the charisma to rise higher in his country ’ s government , diplomats in brussels say he is well-liked .

a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future . " nato is going through a very important process of transformation and adaptation to new circumstances , " the 55-year old dutch former foreign minister said ahead of taking over the helm from robertson on jan .
5 .
after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .
as head of the military alliance , the integration of lithuania , latvia , estonia , romania , bulgaria , slovenia and slovaka , will be one of de hoop scheffer ’ s primary tasks in 2004 .
at the same time nato expands to include the former eastern european states , de hoop scheffer will have to shore up the current members ’ sense of trust after the damaging break-up over iraq .
in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .
" my advice would be focus again on the capabilities , " robertson said before stepping down last month .

jaap de hoop scheffer is the third dutchman to head nato .
while supporters praise the former foreign minister for his diplomatic skill at forging compromises , others criticize him for not taking a critical stance . former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to de hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , so careful was his maneuvering on the diplomatic tightropes .
indeed , the 55-year old is frequently referred to as a skillful statesman , who succeeds in forging compromises where the majority of his colleagues fail .
supporters in the netherlands and europe say those are qualities the new nato secretary general will need when he takes over the helm in 2004 .
" he is , at the end of the day , more of a diplomat than a politician , " fellow christian democrat wim van de camp was quoted by radio netherlands as saying .
" he is not particularly outspoken on any issue .
he has a lot of patience and that is necessary on the international scene . "
de hoop scheffer also won praise from other foreign ministers for the dutch chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe in 2003 .
too soft-spoken for europe ?
not everyone embraces the dutchman ’ s sense of careful-worded diplomacy .
in europe , his appointment was viewed more as a safe choice at a time when the alliance was torn apart over the iraq war than as the best person to guide the alliance into the future .
france in particular was critical of de hoop scheffer ’ s middle-of-the road position on the u.s.-led war .
on the one hand , as dutch foreign minister he extended political support to washington for the ouster of saddam hussein , but on the other hand he held back offering military assistance .
one of his more outspoken critics is ex-european central bank president wim duisenberg .
" i understand very well why jaap de hoop scheffer has now become secretary general of nato ...
he is someone who in his deeds and words follows the united states practically without criticism , " duisenberg told the dutch daily nrc in december .
" it really surprised me that the rest of europe accepted this without any qualms , " the fellow dutchman said .
political experience regardless of what critics say , most agree that de hoop scheffer has the experience and clout needed to head up the transatlantic alliance .
although his military experience is limited to just two years mandatory service , the former lawyer has made a career out of politics and has spent much of his professional life working on the international stage , including a stint as the netherlands representative to nato in brussels .
de hoop scheffer has served as dutch foreign minister in two center-right coalitions , and although many back home say he lacks the charisma to rise higher in his country ’ s government , diplomats in brussels say he is well-liked .
" in the diplomatic career he has had , he ’ s always been very popular and much-liked , " an unnamed brussels diplomat told reuters .

a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future .

after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .

in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .

indeed , the 55-year old is frequently referred to as a skillful statesman , who succeeds in forging compromises where the majority of his colleagues fail .
supporters in the netherlands and europe say those are qualities the new nato secretary general will need when he takes over the helm in 2004 .
" he is , at the end of the day , more of a diplomat than a politician , " fellow christian democrat wim van de camp was quoted by radio netherlands as saying .
" he is not particularly outspoken on any issue .
he has a lot of patience and that is necessary on the international scene . "
de hoop scheffer also won praise from other foreign ministers for the dutch chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe in 2003 .

in europe , his appointment was viewed more as a safe choice at a time when the alliance was torn apart over the iraq war than as the best person to guide the alliance into the future .
france in particular was critical of de hoop scheffer ’ s middle-of-the road position on the u.s.-led war .
on the one hand , as dutch foreign minister he extended political support to washington for the ouster of saddam hussein , but on the other hand he held back offering military assistance .
one of his more outspoken critics is ex-european central bank president wim duisenberg .
" i understand very well why jaap de hoop scheffer has now become secretary general of nato ...

throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future . " nato is going through a very important process of transformation and adaptation to new circumstances , " the 55-year old dutch former foreign minister said ahead of taking over the helm from robertson on jan .

after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .
as head of the military alliance , the integration of lithuania , latvia , estonia , romania , bulgaria , slovenia and slovaka , will be one of de hoop scheffer ’ s primary tasks in 2004 .
at the same time nato expands to include the former eastern european states , de hoop scheffer will have to shore up the current members ’ sense of trust after the damaging break-up over iraq .
in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .

a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future . " nato is going through a very important process of transformation and adaptation to new circumstances , " the 55-year old dutch former foreign minister said ahead of taking over the helm from robertson on jan .
5 .
after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .
as head of the military alliance , the integration of lithuania , latvia , estonia , romania , bulgaria , slovenia and slovaka , will be one of de hoop scheffer ’ s primary tasks in 2004 .
at the same time nato expands to include the former eastern european states , de hoop scheffer will have to shore up the current members ’ sense of trust after the damaging break-up over iraq .
in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .
" my advice would be focus again on the capabilities , " robertson said before stepping down last month .
" if we become a noise box with no ability to act , we will wither and die .

indeed , the 55-year old is frequently referred to as a skillful statesman , who succeeds in forging compromises where the majority of his colleagues fail .
supporters in the netherlands and europe say those are qualities the new nato secretary general will need when he takes over the helm in 2004 .
" he is , at the end of the day , more of a diplomat than a politician , " fellow christian democrat wim van de camp was quoted by radio netherlands as saying .
" he is not particularly outspoken on any issue .
he has a lot of patience and that is necessary on the international scene . "
de hoop scheffer also won praise from other foreign ministers for the dutch chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe in 2003 .
too soft-spoken for europe ?
not everyone embraces the dutchman ’ s sense of careful-worded diplomacy .
in europe , his appointment was viewed more as a safe choice at a time when the alliance was torn apart over the iraq war than as the best person to guide the alliance into the future .
france in particular was critical of de hoop scheffer ’ s middle-of-the road position on the u.s.-led war .
on the one hand , as dutch foreign minister he extended political support to washington for the ouster of saddam hussein , but on the other hand he held back offering military assistance .
one of his more outspoken critics is ex-european central bank president wim duisenberg .
" i understand very well why jaap de hoop scheffer has now become secretary general of nato ...
he is someone who in his deeds and words follows the united states practically without criticism , " duisenberg told the dutch daily nrc in december .
" it really surprised me that the rest of europe accepted this without any qualms , " the fellow dutchman said .
political experience regardless of what critics say , most agree that de hoop scheffer has the experience and clout needed to head up the transatlantic alliance .
although his military experience is limited to just two years mandatory service , the former lawyer has made a career out of politics and has spent much of his professional life working on the international stage , including a stint as the netherlands representative to nato in brussels .
de hoop scheffer has served as dutch foreign minister in two center-right coalitions , and although many back home say he lacks the charisma to rise higher in his country ’ s government , diplomats in brussels say he is well-liked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.01.2004 oriental tradition catches on in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water pipes are becoming popular in germany .
throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.01.2004 dutchman steers nato through new challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch foreign minister jaap de hoop scheffer takes over at nato on monday jaap de hoop scheffer succeeds george robertson as nato ’ s secretary general .
a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future . " nato is going through a very important process of transformation and adaptation to new circumstances , " the 55-year old dutch former foreign minister said ahead of taking over the helm from robertson on jan .
5 .
after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .
as head of the military alliance , the integration of lithuania , latvia , estonia , romania , bulgaria , slovenia and slovaka , will be one of de hoop scheffer ’ s primary tasks in 2004 .
at the same time nato expands to include the former eastern european states , de hoop scheffer will have to shore up the current members ’ sense of trust after the damaging break-up over iraq .
in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .
" my advice would be focus again on the capabilities , " robertson said before stepping down last month .
" if we become a noise box with no ability to act , we will wither and die .

" nato is going through a very important process of transformation and adaptation to new circumstances , " the 55-year old dutch former foreign minister said ahead of taking over the helm from robertson on jan .
5 .
after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .
as head of the military alliance , the integration of lithuania , latvia , estonia , romania , bulgaria , slovenia and slovaka , will be one of de hoop scheffer ’ s primary tasks in 2004 .
at the same time nato expands to include the former eastern european states , de hoop scheffer will have to shore up the current members ’ sense of trust after the damaging break-up over iraq .
in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .
" my advice would be focus again on the capabilities , " robertson said before stepping down last month .

jaap de hoop scheffer is the third dutchman to head nato .
while supporters praise the former foreign minister for his diplomatic skill at forging compromises , others criticize him for not taking a critical stance . former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to de hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , so careful was his maneuvering on the diplomatic tightropes .
indeed , the 55-year old is frequently referred to as a skillful statesman , who succeeds in forging compromises where the majority of his colleagues fail .
supporters in the netherlands and europe say those are qualities the new nato secretary general will need when he takes over the helm in 2004 .
" he is , at the end of the day , more of a diplomat than a politician , " fellow christian democrat wim van de camp was quoted by radio netherlands as saying .
" he is not particularly outspoken on any issue .

de hoop scheffer also won praise from other foreign ministers for the dutch chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe in 2003 .
too soft-spoken for europe ?
not everyone embraces the dutchman ’ s sense of careful-worded diplomacy .
in europe , his appointment was viewed more as a safe choice at a time when the alliance was torn apart over the iraq war than as the best person to guide the alliance into the future .
france in particular was critical of de hoop scheffer ’ s middle-of-the road position on the u.s.-led war .
on the one hand , as dutch foreign minister he extended political support to washington for the ouster of saddam hussein , but on the other hand he held back offering military assistance .
one of his more outspoken critics is ex-european central bank president wim duisenberg .
" i understand very well why jaap de hoop scheffer has now become secretary general of nato ...
he is someone who in his deeds and words follows the united states practically without criticism , " duisenberg told the dutch daily nrc in december .
" it really surprised me that the rest of europe accepted this without any qualms , " the fellow dutchman said .
political experience regardless of what critics say , most agree that de hoop scheffer has the experience and clout needed to head up the transatlantic alliance .
although his military experience is limited to just two years mandatory service , the former lawyer has made a career out of politics and has spent much of his professional life working on the international stage , including a stint as the netherlands representative to nato in brussels .
de hoop scheffer has served as dutch foreign minister in two center-right coalitions , and although many back home say he lacks the charisma to rise higher in his country ’ s government , diplomats in brussels say he is well-liked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.01.2004 oriental tradition catches on in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water pipes are becoming popular in germany .
throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

jaap de hoop scheffer is the third dutchman to head nato .
while supporters praise the former foreign minister for his diplomatic skill at forging compromises , others criticize him for not taking a critical stance . former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to de hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , so careful was his maneuvering on the diplomatic tightropes .
indeed , the 55-year old is frequently referred to as a skillful statesman , who succeeds in forging compromises where the majority of his colleagues fail .
supporters in the netherlands and europe say those are qualities the new nato secretary general will need when he takes over the helm in 2004 .
" he is , at the end of the day , more of a diplomat than a politician , " fellow christian democrat wim van de camp was quoted by radio netherlands as saying .
" he is not particularly outspoken on any issue .
he has a lot of patience and that is necessary on the international scene . "
de hoop scheffer also won praise from other foreign ministers for the dutch chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe in 2003 .
too soft-spoken for europe ?
not everyone embraces the dutchman ’ s sense of careful-worded diplomacy .
in europe , his appointment was viewed more as a safe choice at a time when the alliance was torn apart over the iraq war than as the best person to guide the alliance into the future .
france in particular was critical of de hoop scheffer ’ s middle-of-the road position on the u.s.-led war .
on the one hand , as dutch foreign minister he extended political support to washington for the ouster of saddam hussein , but on the other hand he held back offering military assistance .
one of his more outspoken critics is ex-european central bank president wim duisenberg .
" i understand very well why jaap de hoop scheffer has now become secretary general of nato ...
he is someone who in his deeds and words follows the united states practically without criticism , " duisenberg told the dutch daily nrc in december .
" it really surprised me that the rest of europe accepted this without any qualms , " the fellow dutchman said .
political experience regardless of what critics say , most agree that de hoop scheffer has the experience and clout needed to head up the transatlantic alliance .
although his military experience is limited to just two years mandatory service , the former lawyer has made a career out of politics and has spent much of his professional life working on the international stage , including a stint as the netherlands representative to nato in brussels .
de hoop scheffer has served as dutch foreign minister in two center-right coalitions , and although many back home say he lacks the charisma to rise higher in his country ’ s government , diplomats in brussels say he is well-liked .
" in the diplomatic career he has had , he ’ s always been very popular and much-liked , " an unnamed brussels diplomat told reuters .
" but he has a crisp tongue and is capable of being vigorous when he needs to be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.01.2004 oriental tradition catches on in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water pipes are becoming popular in germany .
throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.01.2004 oriental tradition catches on in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water pipes are becoming popular in germany .
throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future . " nato is going through a very important process of transformation and adaptation to new circumstances , " the 55-year old dutch former foreign minister said ahead of taking over the helm from robertson on jan .
5 .
after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .
as head of the military alliance , the integration of lithuania , latvia , estonia , romania , bulgaria , slovenia and slovaka , will be one of de hoop scheffer ’ s primary tasks in 2004 .
at the same time nato expands to include the former eastern european states , de hoop scheffer will have to shore up the current members ’ sense of trust after the damaging break-up over iraq .
in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .
" my advice would be focus again on the capabilities , " robertson said before stepping down last month .

a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future . " nato is going through a very important process of transformation and adaptation to new circumstances , " the 55-year old dutch former foreign minister said ahead of taking over the helm from robertson on jan .
5 .
after a turbulent 2003 and the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , de hoop scheffer will have his work cut out for him .
as a european atlanticist , many observers say he is well positioned to bridge the gap between those nations that opposed the war , such as germany and france , and those that supported it , chiefly britain and the u.s. as a career diplomat with lengthy experience in the dutch foreign ministry , de hoop scheffer is well versed in traversing the troublesome waters of international security policy .
he has a good rapport with colleagues in paris and berlin , whose languages he speaks fluently , and he is on a first-name basis with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , who welcomed him to the white house after extending dutch political – but not military – support for the iraq war .
however , some european nato members , notably france , have criticized de hoop scheffer as being too pro-american .
indeed , rumors are circulating in brussels that it was washington ’ s backing that actually guaranteed him the post .
observers are warning that the dutchman will have to tread lightly to keep all the members of the alliance happy a delicate tightrope act the future working relationship of the bloc hinges on balancing the interests of all the members , especially as nato expands this year from its current 19 nations to 26 .
as head of the military alliance , the integration of lithuania , latvia , estonia , romania , bulgaria , slovenia and slovaka , will be one of de hoop scheffer ’ s primary tasks in 2004 .
at the same time nato expands to include the former eastern european states , de hoop scheffer will have to shore up the current members ’ sense of trust after the damaging break-up over iraq .
in this regard , he will have to oversee the debate on nato ’ s involvement in the reconstruction of the war-torn country , as well as guide its preparations for the expansion of peacekeeping operations in afghanistan .
another issue that has already caused ripples within nato is the question of how a future european union defense force , as favored by germany and france , would compromise nato ’ s authority .
the united states has come out strong against the eu initiative saying it is redundant and would water down the effectiveness of the transatlantic alliance .
de hoop scheffer , as a representative of an eu member state , will need to wield a good deal of diplomacy in order to prevent the issue from exploding into another political rift .
pushing ahead the new secretary general will also need to continue with his predecessor ’ s campaign to reform nato and modernize europe ’ s armed forces .
chief in this area is the establishment of a rapid response force , whose troops can be deployed anywhere in the world on short notice .
for the long term , de hoop scheffer will need to focus on patching up the military credibility of an alliance which , although it won the cold war , still has been unable to prove itself as the solution for new security threats .
" my advice would be focus again on the capabilities , " robertson said before stepping down last month .

jaap de hoop scheffer is the third dutchman to head nato .
while supporters praise the former foreign minister for his diplomatic skill at forging compromises , others criticize him for not taking a critical stance . former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to de hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , so careful was his maneuvering on the diplomatic tightropes .
indeed , the 55-year old is frequently referred to as a skillful statesman , who succeeds in forging compromises where the majority of his colleagues fail .
supporters in the netherlands and europe say those are qualities the new nato secretary general will need when he takes over the helm in 2004 .
" he is , at the end of the day , more of a diplomat than a politician , " fellow christian democrat wim van de camp was quoted by radio netherlands as saying .
" he is not particularly outspoken on any issue .
he has a lot of patience and that is necessary on the international scene . "
de hoop scheffer also won praise from other foreign ministers for the dutch chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe in 2003 .
too soft-spoken for europe ?
not everyone embraces the dutchman ’ s sense of careful-worded diplomacy .
in europe , his appointment was viewed more as a safe choice at a time when the alliance was torn apart over the iraq war than as the best person to guide the alliance into the future .
france in particular was critical of de hoop scheffer ’ s middle-of-the road position on the u.s.-led war .
on the one hand , as dutch foreign minister he extended political support to washington for the ouster of saddam hussein , but on the other hand he held back offering military assistance .
one of his more outspoken critics is ex-european central bank president wim duisenberg .
" i understand very well why jaap de hoop scheffer has now become secretary general of nato ...
he is someone who in his deeds and words follows the united states practically without criticism , " duisenberg told the dutch daily nrc in december .
" it really surprised me that the rest of europe accepted this without any qualms , " the fellow dutchman said .
political experience regardless of what critics say , most agree that de hoop scheffer has the experience and clout needed to head up the transatlantic alliance .
although his military experience is limited to just two years mandatory service , the former lawyer has made a career out of politics and has spent much of his professional life working on the international stage , including a stint as the netherlands representative to nato in brussels .
de hoop scheffer has served as dutch foreign minister in two center-right coalitions , and although many back home say he lacks the charisma to rise higher in his country ’ s government , diplomats in brussels say he is well-liked .
" in the diplomatic career he has had , he ’ s always been very popular and much-liked , " an unnamed brussels diplomat told reuters .

while supporters praise the former foreign minister for his diplomatic skill at forging compromises , others criticize him for not taking a critical stance . former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to de hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , so careful was his maneuvering on the diplomatic tightropes .
indeed , the 55-year old is frequently referred to as a skillful statesman , who succeeds in forging compromises where the majority of his colleagues fail .
supporters in the netherlands and europe say those are qualities the new nato secretary general will need when he takes over the helm in 2004 .
" he is , at the end of the day , more of a diplomat than a politician , " fellow christian democrat wim van de camp was quoted by radio netherlands as saying .
" he is not particularly outspoken on any issue .
he has a lot of patience and that is necessary on the international scene . "
de hoop scheffer also won praise from other foreign ministers for the dutch chairmanship of the organization for security and cooperation in europe in 2003 .
too soft-spoken for europe ?
not everyone embraces the dutchman ’ s sense of careful-worded diplomacy .
in europe , his appointment was viewed more as a safe choice at a time when the alliance was torn apart over the iraq war than as the best person to guide the alliance into the future .
france in particular was critical of de hoop scheffer ’ s middle-of-the road position on the u.s.-led war .
on the one hand , as dutch foreign minister he extended political support to washington for the ouster of saddam hussein , but on the other hand he held back offering military assistance .
one of his more outspoken critics is ex-european central bank president wim duisenberg .
" i understand very well why jaap de hoop scheffer has now become secretary general of nato ...
he is someone who in his deeds and words follows the united states practically without criticism , " duisenberg told the dutch daily nrc in december .
" it really surprised me that the rest of europe accepted this without any qualms , " the fellow dutchman said .
political experience regardless of what critics say , most agree that de hoop scheffer has the experience and clout needed to head up the transatlantic alliance .
although his military experience is limited to just two years mandatory service , the former lawyer has made a career out of politics and has spent much of his professional life working on the international stage , including a stint as the netherlands representative to nato in brussels .
de hoop scheffer has served as dutch foreign minister in two center-right coalitions , and although many back home say he lacks the charisma to rise higher in his country ’ s government , diplomats in brussels say he is well-liked .
" in the diplomatic career he has had , he ’ s always been very popular and much-liked , " an unnamed brussels diplomat told reuters .
" but he has a crisp tongue and is capable of being vigorous when he needs to be . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutchman steers nato through new challenges jaap de hoop scheffer succeeds george robertson as nato ’ s secretary general .
a career statesman , he will need to rely on his reputed sense of diplomacy to guide the expanding military alliance into the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.01.2004 oriental tradition catches on in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water pipes are becoming popular in germany .
throughout the arab world , the water pipe or " shisha " has been a traditional accompaniment to friendly gatherings since the 17th century .
now , it ’ s becoming increasingly popular in german bars and cafes . berlin : " i first took a draw on a shisha a year ago , while on holiday in turkey , " stephan says .
now the 25-year-old is a regular in the shisha lounge in the berlin district of friedrichshain .
almost every table in the hip bar is occupied by a tall , ornately-decorated water pipe .
it ’ s part of a trend that ’ s popping up in cool places throughout the capital .
brought to the city by arab immigrants , the water pipe has quickly caught on among germans .
stephan ’ s colleague sven got hooked on the oriental water pipe : " i don ’ t drink alcohol and i don ’ t smoke cigarettes , but the shisha is something special .
the cooled smoke is pleasant because it doesn ’ t tickle the throat at all .
i also like the fruity flavor , and of course the sheer sociability of it all . "
importing an oriental tradition in the arab world , the shisha -lrb- which is also known as the nargile or hookah -rrb- , can boast a lengthy tradition dating back to the 17th century .
unlike the more common arab imports , coffee and tea , the water pipe - which uses tobacco flavored with molasses and fruit - never really caught on in europe .
but that ’ s about to change as bars and cafes offering shishas to their guests spring up in berlin .
more and more germans are discovering the pleasures of the oriental smoking ritual .
the iraqi owner of the shisha lounge is delighted by the recent upsurge of curiosity ; but as an experienced gastronome , he ’ s careful not to place all his eggs in one basket : " what we ’ re offering here is a combination cocktail and shushi bar .
the two go together very well . "
not just for men mreihil amer , the lebanese owner of the restaurant babel , sees the water pipe as a luxurious complement to food and drink .
" it ’ s simply very pleasant to spend an hour or two relaxing over a pipe after dinner or after work ; that ’ s the best way for europeans to understand this old arab tradition . "
with oriental flair , and regular belly-dance performances , mreihil amer wants to attract a prosperous and sophisticated clientele .
he rejects any suggestion that the water pipe is popular only among young people : " the shisha is now appreciated by guests of all ages and from all social classes .
that includes lawyers and doctors .
and it ’ s wrong to think of pipe-smoking as an exclusively male domain . "
in his home country , says amer , women enjoy the water pipe just as much as men .
in the arab world they just tend to smoke at home rather than in public , he explains .
a taste of home for many in berlin , smoking the shisha is more than just a cool trend ; it ’ s part of their daily activities .
this is especially obvious in the numerous tearooms and coffeehouses in the poorer quarters of berlin which offer their guests a kind of home away from home .
in these meeting places , the customers are almost exclusively of turkish or arab descent .
here , smoking the water pipe is a matter of course ; the only things the german visitor might miss are alcohol , a chic interior - and some female company .
german shisha fans such as stephan and sven have no desire for quite such an authentic environment .
" i ’ m not really particularly interested in oriental culture , " says stephan , who works as a computer programmer ; yet he wouldn ’ t like to have to do without his shisha , and he may even buy his own someday .
water pipes are available in a range of styles , and can be bought on the internet or in specialist shops .
the same goes for the various tobacco mixtures -lrb- which are imported mainly from yemen -rrb- and the coal needed to light the shisha .
although it ’ s too early to say whether the berlin trend will catch on all over the country , mreihil amer is optimistic .
" in ten years time , there will be more people smoking the water pipe in germany than in lebanon . "

the scheduled 1505 gmt departure on saturday was delayed while all 225 passengers were searched , checked and escorted onto the plane one at a time .
it took off more than three hours late fromm heathrow and landed at dulles airport at around 0210 gmt on sunday .
it had been feared terrorists posed a " specific threat " against the flight .
relief passengers gave a round of applause when the plane finally landed and they reached the terminal area an hour later .
bbc correspondent andy tighe , who was aboard the plane , said the atmosphere had been calm and there were few complaints about the delay .
many people , myself included , were pulled aside by special branch officers just before we got onto the plane and quizzed about why we were going to the united states bbc correspondent andy tighe " a lot of people probably put to the back of their minds the very real fear - that people at senior levels of the american government must have had - that this plane could have been a target for a 11 september-style attack .
" so relief was the predominant emotion on behalf of most of the people on that flight . "
a ba spokeswoman said the plane had been delayed " due to a request from the security authorities in the us to supply them with information about the flight " .

return flight on sunday also cancelled .
security fears also grounded ba flight 263 to the saudi capital riyadh on saturday , plus its return on sunday .
transport secretary alistair darling said the flights to washington and saudi arabia had been cancelled due to " specific information " .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme he would not give a " running commentary on specific threats " but the uk government had access to similar intelligence as the us and acted upon it .
bbc security correspondent frank gardner said his sources believed the flight was cancelled on thursday and friday because of fears a terrorist suspect was planning to hijack the aircraft and crash it into a target in washington .
an official with the us homeland security department confirmed there had been " very specific and credible concerns " about the flights .
passports however , there were separate reports in the new york times , quoting an american official , that the ba flights had been grounded because of pilots ' reservations about flying with air marshals on board .
and on sunday , the observer newspaper said an internal ba memo showed deep opposition among executives to the government initiative .
police monitored boarding passengers ba 's operations director , mike street , had hinted the airline would refuse to fly with air marshals on board because it would mean there was a threat to passengers , the paper said .
the observer also reports there are fears that terror suspects thought to be planning an attack on ba flights may hold legitimate uk , us or other european passports .
it claims new evidence suggests extremists are trying to recruit suicide bombers from educated classes in the uk , because they can more easily penetrate tight security .
on new year 's eve flight 223 was kept on the runway for three hours after landing at washington dulles international airport to allow security officials to board and question passengers .
ba is considering this weekend whether to resume flights to riyadh on monday .
mr darling warned the terrorist threat was likely to continue for the foreseeable future and may inconvenience for air passengers .

frankly , bumping around in the air was the least of my worries .
this was ba 's third attempt at getting this boeing 747 off the runway at heathrow .
the previous two flights had been cancelled for security reasons .
and even now we were more than three hours overdue .
the boarding process had been exhausting .
even by the standards of post-9/11 security procedures , this was painstakingly thorough .
every washington-based passenger on the flight had his or her name checked manually against a list that would be sent to the us authorities .
without their approval the flight was unlikely to get off the ground .
on new year 's eve the same flight was escorted into washington dulles airport by fighter planes and the passengers rigorously questioned .
hand-baggage was scrutinised carefully .
woe-betide anyone who mistakenly packed so much as a tooth-pick .
few complaints selected passengers were themselves frisked and some - myself included - were questioned by plain-clothes detectives .
at the departure gates , armed police and teams of sniffer-dogs passed along the queues of passengers waiting patiently to board the aircraft .
stern-faced airline security staff stood in a line , waiting to carry out random searches .
surprisingly perhaps , there were few complaints about the regular announcements putting back our estimated departure time . "
this is probably the safest aircraft over the atlantic tonight " captain ian herve british airways most people seemed relieved that such attention was so obviously being paid to their safety .
but even once we were all on board there was more waiting .
the american authorities were still checking out details , we were told .
again , there was little grumbling .
the plane was nearly full and many of the passengers were americans anxious to get home after a festive break in europe .
only when the engines began to rumble and the plane slowly edged forward towards the runway were we sure that the flight really was going ahead .
lessons i may have been mistaken , but perhaps there was a little more attention paid than usual to the aircraft safety announcements .
and perhaps more people than normal bothered to watch the cabin staff when they indicated the emergency exits .
but on the whole , there were few signs of fear or even apprehension .
my fellow-passengers appeared to have already adapted themselves to the new realities of international travel in an age of terrorist alerts .
" this is probably the safest aircraft over the atlantic tonight , " announced captain herve reassuringly from the flight deck .
he was almost certainly right .
but the events of the last few days have reminded airlines , governments and passengers of one important thing : that safeguarding civil aviation against international terrorism carries a price in terms of disruption and delays .
there was relief as we touched down in washington and few seemed to mind that we were some hours overdue .
but if this becomes a recurrent feature of international air travel , passengers will quite possibly be less understanding .
and hard questions may start to be asked about the origin and the reliability of the intelligence information upon which the authorities are relying .

but it had n't , and tens of thousands of them died there instead .
korem is still just a couple of rows of mostly single storey mud and stick buildings with corrugated iron roofs .
in 1984 we arrived there at night and got up before dawn to find 40,000 starving people out in the open .

there was a french doctor from medecins sans frontières , bewildered and crying .
" i know nothing of politics " , she told me , " i am just a witness of korem and thousands , millions of these people are going to die . "
they were already dying all around her ; the keening and wailing cut right to your heart .

" it was something unimaginable that we had allowed to happen .

it was not just geldof , by the end of that week the whole country seemed to be mobilising .
we tracked down the little girl in liverpool who saw her mum crying in front of the tv and went out on the streets with her brother , dressed as a guy , for five days running and collected £ 87 , more money than she had ever seen before .
we found the cambridgeshire farmer who could not stand the contrast with the grain mountains he was helping to build up .
he set up a charity that raised £ 2m and sent 12,000 tons of food to the horn of africa .
as geldof says , there was " never a civic movement in history that was so rapidly assembled , so focused and determined , so attuned to the objective " .
for once , everybody thought they could do something ; that they could make a difference .
was it something about them ?
the visible scale of their suffering , the helplessness of their mass victimhood ?

sport aid , a year later was the world 's biggest-ever sporting occasion ; 20 million people ran for africa and raised $ 100 million .

the worst thing is to starve , the next worst thing is to beg " ethiopian pm meles zenawi ethiopia 's government is ideologically , even romantically , focused on the peasants amongst whom they lived during the long years of war .
they genuinely want them to have a better life but , crucially , they insist that they stay peasants .
meles zenawi says the alternative would be disastrous .
" allowing peasants to sell their land in conditions of recurring drought would mean they would sell under duress and descend on the towns in their millions . "
the government 's critics say it 's all about power .
it is easier to control people stuck on their land , whose livelihood can be taken away from them by the stroke of a party worker 's pen , than a rootless and disgruntled city population .
the government 's stated strategy is " agriculture-led development " .
the idea is to make the peasants more prosperous so an indigenous industry grows up naturally , financed by the new spending power of the rural population .
so far it has been a failure .
the peasants are a great deal poorer than they were in 1984 .
they lost everything then and most have not been able to replace the possessions , tools and animals that went in the famine .
average annual income then was $ 190 ; now it is $ 108 .
food production per head is estimated to have fallen from 450 kgs in 1984/5 to 140 kgs in 2002/3 .
even in an average year six million ethiopians now have to be fed by the outside world .
ethiopia has received more relief aid in the past 20 years than any other country on earth .
but it has had less development aid than any other needy nation .
prime minister zenawi finds it humiliating .
" the worst thing is to starve " , he told me .
" the next worst thing is to beg " .

the 1984/5 famine killed nearly one million people it is nearly 20 years now since i flew north from addis ababa , with the legendary cameraman , mohamed amin , into the greatest natural disaster of the twentieth century .
it was compounded by man , of course .
the marxist military regime of colonel haile-mariam mengistu and the infamous derg , was cruel even by african standards .
the wars they were fighting with the rebel movements of the north turned the highlands into battlegrounds and cut the starving off from the outside world .
the outside world did not care very much .
the west was not keen to help a soviet-backed tyranny during one of the last spasms of the cold war .
the result was a crisis that tipped into catastrophe .
scattered bodies when the autumn rains failed , the highlanders left their homes in millions and trekked away to look for help .
we found their bodies scattered over the mountainsides .
it was something unimaginable that we had allowed to happen , doing nothing would mean you were complicit in murder bob geldof those that survived the journey , made it to places like korem and mekele on the great spinal road north where help might have been , if help had come .
but it had n't , and tens of thousands of them died there instead .
korem is still just a couple of rows of mostly single storey mud and stick buildings with corrugated iron roofs .
in 1984 we arrived there at night and got up before dawn to find 40,000 starving people out in the open .
save the children had set up a small supplementary feeding centre for babies , but it was completely overwhelmed .
there was a french doctor from medecins sans frontières , bewildered and crying .
" i know nothing of politics " , she told me , " i am just a witness of korem and thousands , millions of these people are going to die . "
they were already dying all around her ; the keening and wailing cut right to your heart .
' murder ' two decades later , bob geldof is still emotional about what he saw that night in his home in chelsea .
" it was something unimaginable that we had allowed to happen .
doing nothing would mean you were complicit in murder " .
it was not just geldof , by the end of that week the whole country seemed to be mobilising .
we tracked down the little girl in liverpool who saw her mum crying in front of the tv and went out on the streets with her brother , dressed as a guy , for five days running and collected £ 87 , more money than she had ever seen before .
images of starving ethiopians shocked the world we found the cambridgeshire farmer who could not stand the contrast with the grain mountains he was helping to build up .
he set up a charity that raised £ 2m and sent 12,000 tons of food to the horn of africa .
as geldof says , there was " never a civic movement in history that was so rapidly assembled , so focused and determined , so attuned to the objective " .
for once , everybody thought they could do something ; that they could make a difference .
was it something about them ?
the visible scale of their suffering , the helplessness of their mass victimhood ?
or was it something about us ?
did it catch us at a moment in the middle of the thatcher and reagan years when our prosperity seemed suddenly selfish and uncaring ?
it was geldof who articulated the anger and harnessed the sympathy .
do they know it 's christmas ? , the song he scribbled in the back of a taxi and persuaded the country 's biggest stars to sing , sold 50 million copies .
live aid , the following summer , was not just the greatest concert ever held ; it was the biggest shared event in human history .
sport aid , a year later was the world 's biggest-ever sporting occasion ; 20 million people ran for africa and raised $ 100 million .
what good did it all do ?
if nothing else , it saved between a million and two million lives , but we did not solve ethiopia 's problems .
population explosion the population in the highlands has exploded .
it is heading for double the size it was in 1984 .
the ever-rising numbers are putting more pressure on the land , pushing people further up the mountains to the margins of fertility .
ethiopia : now and then average income in 1984 : $ 190 average income today : $ 108 six million ethiopians are fed by international aid each year annual population rise : 2.7 % annual topsoil loss : 2.7 % the thin soil is exhausted ; the trees that bound it to the hillsides have long since been chopped down for firewood .
when it is dry it blows away as dust and on satellite pictures you can sometimes see a red cloud heading out over the indian ocean .
when it rains , the topsoil is swilled away by the rivers .
all ethiopia 's rivers run dark brown .
there 's a chilling symmetry in the statistics ; the percentage rise in population is exactly the same as the percentage loss of topsoil ; both 2.7 % a year .
some things have improved .
the great civil wars ended in the early 90s , the derg fell and mengistu fled , to be sheltered in zimbabwe by his fellow tyrant , mugabe .
the rebels were marxists , too , but the then new prime minister , meles zenawi , and his senior colleagues all enrolled for an open university mba course .
they did not abandon their political roots altogether , but modified their policies or at least their image , to fit a world where capitalism was triumphant .

a single ticket in zone 1 has increased from £ 1.60 to £ 2 and bus fares in the outer zones will go up from 70p to £ 1 for those paying with cash .
but passengers using the oyster smartcard , which has a pre-pay facility , will be able to travel at 2003 prices .
london mayor ken livingstone said the new fares were designed to cut queues at tube stations and speed up buses by encouraging people to use pre-paid tickets .
the mayor has already revealed a £ 64m shortfall in his transport budget caused by lower than expected revenues from the congestion charge scheme .
price hikes the tube fare increases include : a zone 1- 2 single rising to 10 % from £ 2 to £ 2.20 a zone 1-4 weekly travelcard rising by 3.2 % from £ 28.40 to £ 29.30 a zone 1 weekly travelcard increasing by 12.1 % from £ 16.15 to £ 18.15 a book of 10 carnet tube tickets increasing 30.4 % from £ 11.50 to £ 15 " the new four-year fare package will encourage people to switch to pre-paid tickets like the oyster smartcard and bus saver tickets , " said mr livingstone last year .
" london 's transport network continues to improve , the most obvious example being the massive improvement of our bus network , but this comes at a cost that has to be met so we can keep the improvements coming . "
customers using the oyster cards will be able to top them up over the phone , the internet or at ticket offices and machines .
it is hoped that within three years , paying for public transport in london will become a virtually cashless system .
mr livingstone also announced that children under 11 will travel for free on all london buses from next year .
and there is also free child travel at weekends with a family travelcard .
he added that any further annual increases will be pegged to inflation .
