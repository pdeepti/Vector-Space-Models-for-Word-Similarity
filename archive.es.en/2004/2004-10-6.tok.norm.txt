the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .
three other military transport planes were standing by to take a further 300 deportees back to libya during the afternoon . " inhumane " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants appear from the german cap anamur aid ship as they dock in the sicilian harbour of porto empedocle , italy in july .
the un high commissioner for refugees as well as the italian opposition have described the large-scale expulsions as " inhumane . "
italian television broadcast graphic images of hundreds of handcuffed refugees in lampedusa herded by policeman into waiting military planes . " the immigrants have been treated without the slightest respect for international conventions , " pietro folena , parliamentarian and member of italy 's largest opposition party , democrats of the left -lrb- ds -rrb- told afp .
" italy 's reputation has been besmirched by an offense against human rights , " folena added . amnesty international and doctors without borders also slammed the deportation , saying it was a " grave violation " of national and international asylum laws . italian stance on refugees laura boldrini , unhcr spokeswoman said that the speeded up deportation process of refugees from lampedusa was shrouded in secrecy . boldrini said the italian authorities made no effort to differentiate between asylum-seeking candidates and economic refugees .
she also pointed out that the authorities did n't even possess equipment for carrying out identification measures such as fingerprints or photographs of the refugees . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu was quoted as saying , " the poor devils -lrb- the refugees -rrb- must know that they will get humanitarian help , but then will be sent back immediately to the place where they came from . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhausted african refugees lie in a boot near the italian island of lampedusa in oct .
2003 .
but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .
thus , italy sends rejected refugees after a perfunctory check , back to a country where the basic standards of refugee rights are n't guaranteed , experts complain . in brussels on tuesday , italy 's nominee to become the european union 's justice and home affairs commissioner , rocco buttiglione said he was not aware of any violations .
" if this information is wrong , i 'll be the first one to denounce the situation , " buttiglione told the apcom news agency . unhcr waiting for access to refugees meanwhile on wednesday , the unhcr complained that italian authorities have not yet given the un agency clearance to the around 500 refugees who are still believed to be in lampedusa . " we are concerned because among the people who have been sent back , there were some who would perhaps have had the right to lodge a request for political asylum , " juergen humburg of the unhcr told afp . over the last two days alone , over a thousand would-be immigrants are said to have landed on italy 's southern coast .
one of the boats carrying the immigrants capsized off the coast of tunisia on monday , killing at least 22 people . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will have a chance to discuss the issue with libyan officials during a short visit on thursday .
berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa . " spain is not favorable to this kind of initiative , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said tuesday .
moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .
the plan is to be discussed at a meeting of eu interior ministers later this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .

the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .

the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .

chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .

some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country . " we started seeing town centers begin emptying out in the mid 1990s , " beate glöckner of the irs institute for regional development and structural planning told dw-world .
" the trend has begun to accelerate . " now city planners and demographers fear that the karstadt closings could mean that vicious circle is about spread to even more municipalities . " it can be the beginning of the decay of a town 's infrastructure , " reiner klingholz , director of the berlin institute for world population and global development , told dw-world .
" certain shops close , windows are shuttered , and this makes the place unattractive , not just for shoppers and existing businesses , but for new businesses as well . " the karstadt store in the bavarian town of deggendorf is one of the outlets threatened with closure .
while the news has the store 's 120 employees worried about their careers , it also has surrounding businesses fearing for their own futures . " it 's terrible , " sait ögütmen , owner of a snack bar next to the department store , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" the whole square here will deteriorate . " the " wal-mart " effect in fact , more and more often in germany , new businesses are avoiding town centers and choosing to set up shop in the open countryside on the outskirts of town .
already , only around a third of retail establishments in germany are in town centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart stores in the united states do a booming business it 's a similar phenomenon to the wal-mart story in the united states .
now the world 's largest store chain , wal-mart embarked on a massive expansion course in the 1990s , setting up its warehouse-like stores in former farm fields , where it could offer customers plenty of free parking and a huge selection of merchandise , often at rock-bottom prices . the result , however , was that smaller mom-and-pop stores up and down main street in small-town america could not compete and were forced out of business .
today , many stores in traditional small town centers are boarded up while the real centers of retail activity have shifted to the conglomerations outside the town limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea store in germany germany is seeing a similar development and the success stories on the german retail landscape , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , electronics superstore mediamarkt or the booming home improvement stores are enthusiastically following the new concept . " they 've developed whole shopping centers , offering acres of parking and a conglomeration of stores close to one another , " blanek said .
" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .
" there are other possibilities they can use to bring shoppers back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medieval town centers , like this one in trier in western germany , offer a unique shopping experience he suggests that stores in town centers cooperate on several levels , such as harmonizing their opening hours , establishing special incentives for shoppers to come downtown , or redesigning their shopping areas to take advantage of the unique historical character of the area . " town centers have things to offer consumers that the big superstores centers out of town can not , " he said .
" the shopping experience is , you might say , more authentic .

some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country . " we started seeing town centers begin emptying out in the mid 1990s , " beate glöckner of the irs institute for regional development and structural planning told dw-world .
" the trend has begun to accelerate . " now city planners and demographers fear that the karstadt closings could mean that vicious circle is about spread to even more municipalities . " it can be the beginning of the decay of a town 's infrastructure , " reiner klingholz , director of the berlin institute for world population and global development , told dw-world .
" certain shops close , windows are shuttered , and this makes the place unattractive , not just for shoppers and existing businesses , but for new businesses as well . " the karstadt store in the bavarian town of deggendorf is one of the outlets threatened with closure .
while the news has the store 's 120 employees worried about their careers , it also has surrounding businesses fearing for their own futures . " it 's terrible , " sait ögütmen , owner of a snack bar next to the department store , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" the whole square here will deteriorate . " the " wal-mart " effect in fact , more and more often in germany , new businesses are avoiding town centers and choosing to set up shop in the open countryside on the outskirts of town .
already , only around a third of retail establishments in germany are in town centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart stores in the united states do a booming business it 's a similar phenomenon to the wal-mart story in the united states .
now the world 's largest store chain , wal-mart embarked on a massive expansion course in the 1990s , setting up its warehouse-like stores in former farm fields , where it could offer customers plenty of free parking and a huge selection of merchandise , often at rock-bottom prices . the result , however , was that smaller mom-and-pop stores up and down main street in small-town america could not compete and were forced out of business .
today , many stores in traditional small town centers are boarded up while the real centers of retail activity have shifted to the conglomerations outside the town limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea store in germany germany is seeing a similar development and the success stories on the german retail landscape , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , electronics superstore mediamarkt or the booming home improvement stores are enthusiastically following the new concept . " they 've developed whole shopping centers , offering acres of parking and a conglomeration of stores close to one another , " blanek said .
" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .
" there are other possibilities they can use to bring shoppers back .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .
anyone who earns more than that can opt out .
this opt-out option presents a twofold risk , lauterbach said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with insurance , healthcare clients still have to shell out a copayment " on the one hand the groups engaged by the state to provide insurance lose premiums , " he said .
" on the other hand , the costs of illness have gotten so high that no one can afford to pay them alone . "
even people who earn very high salaries are effected when they opt out of insurance altogether , he said .
mess in the us lauterbach cited the united states as an example of the risks both individuals and society can take when health care is privatized .
some 120 million us citizens - 40 percent of the population - are either uninsured or underinsured .
of these , 44 million have no insurance protection whatsoever , while the rest are only partly insured .
" many us citizens ca n't afford adequate insurance and thus do n't get insurance for illnesses they may already have , " lauterbach said .
another case in point is the young , healthy americans who are in the middle of building up companies and families .
" they often have to opt to be uninsured purely on the basis of cost , " lauterbach said . " then if they get sick , it can lead to them losing their business .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .
anyone who earns more than that can opt out .
this opt-out option presents a twofold risk , lauterbach said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with insurance , healthcare clients still have to shell out a copayment " on the one hand the groups engaged by the state to provide insurance lose premiums , " he said .
" on the other hand , the costs of illness have gotten so high that no one can afford to pay them alone . "
even people who earn very high salaries are effected when they opt out of insurance altogether , he said .
mess in the us lauterbach cited the united states as an example of the risks both individuals and society can take when health care is privatized .
some 120 million us citizens - 40 percent of the population - are either uninsured or underinsured .
of these , 44 million have no insurance protection whatsoever , while the rest are only partly insured .
" many us citizens ca n't afford adequate insurance and thus do n't get insurance for illnesses they may already have , " lauterbach said .
another case in point is the young , healthy americans who are in the middle of building up companies and families .
" they often have to opt to be uninsured purely on the basis of cost , " lauterbach said . " then if they get sick , it can lead to them losing their business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.10.2004 far-right party recruits neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the march forward : ndp leaders are looking to enter national politics emboldened by recent regional election gains , germany 's far-right ndp party is pressing on .
with an eye on upcoming national elections , the party has recruited prominent neo-nazis for top leadership positions . germany 's far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which made headlines last month when it won 9.2 percent of the vote in regional elections in the eastern state of saxony , is pressing on with its efforts to enter the national government .
looking ahead to upcoming federal elections in 2006 , the npd has recruited two prominent neo-nazis for high-ranking leadership positions .
the move is part of a larger plan to create a " people 's front " from the right .
npd leader udo voigt is also scheduled to meet with gerhard frey , the leader of the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , another far right party that snagged 6.1 percent of the vote in brandenburg during the same regional elections , for talks focused on a possible alliance .
prominent neo-nazis join the ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters demonstrated against banning the party in recruiting thomas wulff and thorsten heise onto the ndp 's board of directors - a move which will be officially announced at the party 's conference at the end of october - the ndp will gain two prominent members of the neo-nazi movement with a strong regional following and national profile .
wulff directs the far-right scene in hamburg , and heise is active in thüringen .
their appointment could mobilize additional far-right voters and facilitate the ndp 's grab for power and influence at the national level - or so the ndp leadership hopes .
by pushing for alliances , the ndp is , in effect , serving as the unifier of germany 's previously somewhat fragmented far-right scene .

with an eye on upcoming national elections , the party has recruited prominent neo-nazis for top leadership positions . germany 's far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which made headlines last month when it won 9.2 percent of the vote in regional elections in the eastern state of saxony , is pressing on with its efforts to enter the national government .
looking ahead to upcoming federal elections in 2006 , the npd has recruited two prominent neo-nazis for high-ranking leadership positions .
the move is part of a larger plan to create a " people 's front " from the right .
npd leader udo voigt is also scheduled to meet with gerhard frey , the leader of the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , another far right party that snagged 6.1 percent of the vote in brandenburg during the same regional elections , for talks focused on a possible alliance .
prominent neo-nazis join the ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters demonstrated against banning the party in recruiting thomas wulff and thorsten heise onto the ndp 's board of directors - a move which will be officially announced at the party 's conference at the end of october - the ndp will gain two prominent members of the neo-nazi movement with a strong regional following and national profile .
wulff directs the far-right scene in hamburg , and heise is active in thüringen .
their appointment could mobilize additional far-right voters and facilitate the ndp 's grab for power and influence at the national level - or so the ndp leadership hopes .
by pushing for alliances , the ndp is , in effect , serving as the unifier of germany 's previously somewhat fragmented far-right scene .
" the most important thing is to get into the federal parliament in 2006 , " said klaus beier , the ndp spokesman .
" in the future there will be no more working against one another . "
the npd claims that the far-right could win 7 percent of the vote in a national election , but analysts doubt that will happen .
will the government move to ban the party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a demonstration in august last year , the german federal government failed in its effort to have the country 's highest court ban the ndp .
the court decided to close the case on the grounds that several of the witnesses had ties to germany 's domestic intelligence agency .
the government , however , was successful in foiling ndp plans to hold a massive demonstration in berlin with the xenophobic title " berlin stays german . "
though german interior minister otto schily has said that the government will not make a second attempt to ban the party , the addition of prominent neo-nazis to the party ranks and its attempt to repeat regional successes on the national stage could change that . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?
even though the results did n't come as a surprise , many germans were shocked at the success of extreme right-wing parties celebrating their success in two state elections .
german bloggerville also had something to say .
-lrb- september 23 , 2004 -rrb- german far-right aims for national alliance after scoring a big win in an eastern state poll last weekend , the neo-nazi national democratic party has said it aims to join forces with other far-right parties for the 2006 national election in germany .
-lrb- september 22 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors .

the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .
three other military transport planes were standing by to take a further 300 deportees back to libya during the afternoon . " inhumane " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants appear from the german cap anamur aid ship as they dock in the sicilian harbour of porto empedocle , italy in july .
the un high commissioner for refugees as well as the italian opposition have described the large-scale expulsions as " inhumane . "
italian television broadcast graphic images of hundreds of handcuffed refugees in lampedusa herded by policeman into waiting military planes . " the immigrants have been treated without the slightest respect for international conventions , " pietro folena , parliamentarian and member of italy 's largest opposition party , democrats of the left -lrb- ds -rrb- told afp .
" italy 's reputation has been besmirched by an offense against human rights , " folena added . amnesty international and doctors without borders also slammed the deportation , saying it was a " grave violation " of national and international asylum laws . italian stance on refugees laura boldrini , unhcr spokeswoman said that the speeded up deportation process of refugees from lampedusa was shrouded in secrecy . boldrini said the italian authorities made no effort to differentiate between asylum-seeking candidates and economic refugees .
she also pointed out that the authorities did n't even possess equipment for carrying out identification measures such as fingerprints or photographs of the refugees . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu was quoted as saying , " the poor devils -lrb- the refugees -rrb- must know that they will get humanitarian help , but then will be sent back immediately to the place where they came from . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhausted african refugees lie in a boot near the italian island of lampedusa in oct .
2003 .
but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .
thus , italy sends rejected refugees after a perfunctory check , back to a country where the basic standards of refugee rights are n't guaranteed , experts complain . in brussels on tuesday , italy 's nominee to become the european union 's justice and home affairs commissioner , rocco buttiglione said he was not aware of any violations .
" if this information is wrong , i 'll be the first one to denounce the situation , " buttiglione told the apcom news agency . unhcr waiting for access to refugees meanwhile on wednesday , the unhcr complained that italian authorities have not yet given the un agency clearance to the around 500 refugees who are still believed to be in lampedusa . " we are concerned because among the people who have been sent back , there were some who would perhaps have had the right to lodge a request for political asylum , " juergen humburg of the unhcr told afp . over the last two days alone , over a thousand would-be immigrants are said to have landed on italy 's southern coast .
one of the boats carrying the immigrants capsized off the coast of tunisia on monday , killing at least 22 people . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will have a chance to discuss the issue with libyan officials during a short visit on thursday .
berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa . " spain is not favorable to this kind of initiative , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said tuesday .
moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .
the plan is to be discussed at a meeting of eu interior ministers later this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .

according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
eu officials have also not given a concrete date for turkey 's actual entry .
most estimates , though , indicate that ankara 's road to brussels will extend until well into the next decade , with 15 years the most likely target .
bumpy road to membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's been looking to join the eu for 40 years turkey , an official candidate since 1999 , has been waiting to join the european club for four decades .
but within the european bloc , turkish membership has been a controversial topic , with opinion divided on whether to accept a large , poor and predominantly muslim nation of 70 million with a patchy record on human rights .
" there is clearly the possibility that turkey can become a member , but the negotiations , and this is very important , are open-ended , " agriculture commissioner franz fischler said after the commission made its announcement .
" there is no more ground to be opposed fundamentally to the start of entry talks .
it is also clear that there is still a lot to do , " said fischler ahead of an official statement read in the european parliament .
the report noted ankara had made substantial progress in passing political reforms but still needed to improve implementation , notably in the fight against torture and the protection of fundamental liberties such as the freedom of expression and religion , and rights for women , trade unions and minorities .
" the commission will recommend the suspension of the negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the union is based , " it stated .
an emergency brake turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who was instrumental in pushing through policy reforms to bring his country in line with eu criteria for accession talks , voiced dismay at hints there would be an " emergency brake . "
prior to wednesday 's announcement he told deutsche welle that turkey had " done its homework " and it was now " up to the eu to uphold their end " and proceed with negotiations .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday also rejected any suggestion of " special conditions " for turkey and said the same criteria should apply to his country as to the 10 mostly eastern and southern european members who entered the bloc this past may .
european commission president romano prodi , speaking to reuters on the eve of his outgoing executive 's last major decision , played down the novelty of introducing an " emergency brake " to stop talks if ankara slipped on key standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani prodi , european commission president " we have to be sure that turkey will be like any of the other member states in case they come in , " he said , insisting the commission would apply the same standards to ankara 's bid as it did to all previous applicants .
" do n't you think there were clearly built-in emergency brakes in all the negotiations we had ? " he said .
special conditions for turkey in its report the commission also recommended the eu consider implementing permanent safeguards that would curb migrant labor from turkey , as well as agree to " specific arrangements " before ankara benefits fully from eu farm subsidies and regional aid .
an impact study leaked to the press ahead of the commission 's announcement revealed that between 500,000 and four million turkish migrants a year could move into the rest of the eu after membership , and that yearly subsidies of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- would be required to bring turkey 's agriculture and infrastructure up to par with the rest of the bloc .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures found near srebrenica these actions , in 1992 and 1993 , are seen by some as having played a role in fueling anti-muslim sentiment in the srebrenica enclave before the infamous massacre in july 1995 , the worst case of genocide in europe since world war ii .
pillaging of villages oric also faces charges related to the destruction of villages around srebrenica .
during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

dw-world looks at how many of the big players see the issue . if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in late 2005 , bringing to head years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
but the issue of turkish membership in the eu has been hotly debated both in brussels and in the member states .
here 's a look at what some of the key players in the debate have to say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan , left , and chancellor schröder germany - chancellor gerhard schröder 's government is one of the most vocal proponents of welcoming turkey into the bloc .
with one eye on germany 's 2.5 million turks , the coalition of social democrats and greens back voting for membership talks at the december summit .
just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. peacekeepers walk along the barbed wires and barrels that mark the " green line " which separates turkish and greek cypriot communities greece - conservative prime minister costas karamanlis is a strong supporter of turkey 's bid , continuing the rapprochement policy of his socialist predecessor , costas simitis .
karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .
" what olli did was by no means ok , " raged bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we told olli that actions such as that endanger his reputation . "
even kahn 's goalkeeping coach and long-term friend , sepp maier , put the boot in .
" that was a stupid thing he did with klose , " maier told munich newspaper az .
" he should know that himself . "
bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .
kahn has a reputation for having a short fuse and he earned the unwanted nickname ' genghis kahn ' after a kung-fu kick attack on borussia dortmund 's stephane chapuisat in april 1999 .
but germany coach jürgen klinsmann was unaffacted by the incident claiming it was part and parcel of soccer .

" i do not think two international team-mates going for one another should be blown up , " said klinsmann .
" it is an emotional moment that can happen in the match .
that will also happen two months before the world cup . "
klose and kahn will avoid one another when germany face iran on saturday in tehran with klinsmann opting to rest kahn and hand a starting chance to arsenal 's jens lehmann .
eager lehmann earlier this week , lehmann said he would be in goal for germany for the 2006 world cup campaign leaving bayern munich 's oliver kahn warming the substitutes ' bench .
the former borussia dortmund custodian vowed to put kahn in the shade during his match against iran .
" i am convinced that i will be in goal for the 2006 world cup , " insisted lehmann in magazine kicker .
" i am at the peak of my career in terms of experience and sporting ability . "
bayern shot-stopper kahn was stripped of the captaincy by klinsmann , with michael ballack favored , and lehmann believes his chances are improved with kahn no longer guaranteed a place in the starting line-up .
" the captain has to play so a goalkeeper as captain is not the best idea , " added lehmann .
" for me it was awful to be in competition with someone who has a 40 percent advantage because he is captain . "
kahn has been first choice goalkeeper for the german national team since the tail end of 1996 winning 74 caps while lehmann has just 19 .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .
those reforms included abolishing the death penalty , eliminating state security courts , adopting a " zero-tolerance policy " toward torture and reigning in the power of the military , which has seized power in turkey several times in recent decades , " in conformity with democratic norms , " he said .
he also said turkey will join the international criminal court .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .
those reforms included abolishing the death penalty , eliminating state security courts , adopting a " zero-tolerance policy " toward torture and reigning in the power of the military , which has seized power in turkey several times in recent decades , " in conformity with democratic norms , " he said .
he also said turkey will join the international criminal court .
" we hope to bring a long-traveled road to its final lap with the initiation of accession negotiations in the first half of 2005 , " he told the parliamentary committee of the council of europe , a group formed in 1949 to promote human rights and democracy in europe , but with no formal link to the eu .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .
those reforms included abolishing the death penalty , eliminating state security courts , adopting a " zero-tolerance policy " toward torture and reigning in the power of the military , which has seized power in turkey several times in recent decades , " in conformity with democratic norms , " he said .
he also said turkey will join the international criminal court .
" we hope to bring a long-traveled road to its final lap with the initiation of accession negotiations in the first half of 2005 , " he told the parliamentary committee of the council of europe , a group formed in 1949 to promote human rights and democracy in europe , but with no formal link to the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with eu commission president romano prodi in brussels erdogan added that he hoped that the accession talks would not drag on indefinitely , reflecting turkey 's frustration at its perception that the european bloc has been hinting at membership for decades but hardly moving in that direction .
" turkish membership will not be achieved overnight , " he said but added that his government expects to " conclude this phase within a reasonable amount of time . "
a decade or more while the eu 's head office formally recommended in a report on wednesday that talks begin with turkey , eu heads of state will make the final decision at their dec .
17 summit .
but even if the decision is favorable to turkey soon , officials have suggested negotiations could last a decade or more .
president jacques chirac of france , who is hanoi , vietnam where he will attend an asia-europe summit , said the process was only at the very beginning .
" if the european commission decides in december to open those negotiations , everybody is aware that these negotiations could last at the minimum between 10 and 15 years , " he told reporters .

erdogan told reporters on wednesday that has said he understands the concerns the european commission might have about allowing turkey to join , but added that he does not expect special treatment .
" we expect to be subject to the same rules and conditions as other candidates , " he said .
german reaction in germany , opinion was split on the recommendation by the european commission that accession talks begin .
chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a visit to india , said he welcomed the recommendation by the commission and that germany would vote yes at the december meeting .
foreign minister joschka fischer was also positive about the commission 's report , saying the time frame of 10 to 15 years until actual membership was realistic .
however , conservative leader angela merkel of the christian democrats , was less enthusiastic , saying her party prefers offering turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .
germany industry and trade associations hailed the progress toward membership talks as a positive development .
according to the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the german economy could benefit from turkey 's membership , especially since turkey is a growth economy with strong strategic potential for german firms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off negotiations at opel continue opinion : blame the managers , not the country business -pipe- 06.10.2004 germany 's crippled city centers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if big downtown stores go under , so could their smaller neighbors germany 's largest department store chain , karstadt , has announced it might close 77 of its stores , primarily in smaller cities and towns .
some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country . " we started seeing town centers begin emptying out in the mid 1990s , " beate glöckner of the irs institute for regional development and structural planning told dw-world .
" the trend has begun to accelerate . " now city planners and demographers fear that the karstadt closings could mean that vicious circle is about spread to even more municipalities . " it can be the beginning of the decay of a town 's infrastructure , " reiner klingholz , director of the berlin institute for world population and global development , told dw-world .
" certain shops close , windows are shuttered , and this makes the place unattractive , not just for shoppers and existing businesses , but for new businesses as well . " the karstadt store in the bavarian town of deggendorf is one of the outlets threatened with closure .
while the news has the store 's 120 employees worried about their careers , it also has surrounding businesses fearing for their own futures . " it 's terrible , " sait ögütmen , owner of a snack bar next to the department store , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" the whole square here will deteriorate . " the " wal-mart " effect in fact , more and more often in germany , new businesses are avoiding town centers and choosing to set up shop in the open countryside on the outskirts of town .
already , only around a third of retail establishments in germany are in town centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart stores in the united states do a booming business it 's a similar phenomenon to the wal-mart story in the united states .
now the world 's largest store chain , wal-mart embarked on a massive expansion course in the 1990s , setting up its warehouse-like stores in former farm fields , where it could offer customers plenty of free parking and a huge selection of merchandise , often at rock-bottom prices . the result , however , was that smaller mom-and-pop stores up and down main street in small-town america could not compete and were forced out of business .
today , many stores in traditional small town centers are boarded up while the real centers of retail activity have shifted to the conglomerations outside the town limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea store in germany germany is seeing a similar development and the success stories on the german retail landscape , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , electronics superstore mediamarkt or the booming home improvement stores are enthusiastically following the new concept . " they 've developed whole shopping centers , offering acres of parking and a conglomeration of stores close to one another , " blanek said .
" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .
" there are other possibilities they can use to bring shoppers back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medieval town centers , like this one in trier in western germany , offer a unique shopping experience he suggests that stores in town centers cooperate on several levels , such as harmonizing their opening hours , establishing special incentives for shoppers to come downtown , or redesigning their shopping areas to take advantage of the unique historical character of the area . " town centers have things to offer consumers that the big superstores centers out of town can not , " he said .
" the shopping experience is , you might say , more authentic .
people like that .

already , only around a third of retail establishments in germany are in town centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart stores in the united states do a booming business it 's a similar phenomenon to the wal-mart story in the united states .
now the world 's largest store chain , wal-mart embarked on a massive expansion course in the 1990s , setting up its warehouse-like stores in former farm fields , where it could offer customers plenty of free parking and a huge selection of merchandise , often at rock-bottom prices . the result , however , was that smaller mom-and-pop stores up and down main street in small-town america could not compete and were forced out of business .
today , many stores in traditional small town centers are boarded up while the real centers of retail activity have shifted to the conglomerations outside the town limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea store in germany germany is seeing a similar development and the success stories on the german retail landscape , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , electronics superstore mediamarkt or the booming home improvement stores are enthusiastically following the new concept . " they 've developed whole shopping centers , offering acres of parking and a conglomeration of stores close to one another , " blanek said .
" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .
" there are other possibilities they can use to bring shoppers back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medieval town centers , like this one in trier in western germany , offer a unique shopping experience he suggests that stores in town centers cooperate on several levels , such as harmonizing their opening hours , establishing special incentives for shoppers to come downtown , or redesigning their shopping areas to take advantage of the unique historical character of the area . " town centers have things to offer consumers that the big superstores centers out of town can not , " he said .
" the shopping experience is , you might say , more authentic .
people like that .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .

pillaging of villages oric also faces charges related to the destruction of villages around srebrenica .
during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

with an eye on upcoming national elections , the party has recruited prominent neo-nazis for top leadership positions . germany 's far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which made headlines last month when it won 9.2 percent of the vote in regional elections in the eastern state of saxony , is pressing on with its efforts to enter the national government .
looking ahead to upcoming federal elections in 2006 , the npd has recruited two prominent neo-nazis for high-ranking leadership positions .
the move is part of a larger plan to create a " people 's front " from the right .
npd leader udo voigt is also scheduled to meet with gerhard frey , the leader of the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , another far right party that snagged 6.1 percent of the vote in brandenburg during the same regional elections , for talks focused on a possible alliance .
prominent neo-nazis join the ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters demonstrated against banning the party in recruiting thomas wulff and thorsten heise onto the ndp 's board of directors - a move which will be officially announced at the party 's conference at the end of october - the ndp will gain two prominent members of the neo-nazi movement with a strong regional following and national profile .
wulff directs the far-right scene in hamburg , and heise is active in thüringen .
their appointment could mobilize additional far-right voters and facilitate the ndp 's grab for power and influence at the national level - or so the ndp leadership hopes .
by pushing for alliances , the ndp is , in effect , serving as the unifier of germany 's previously somewhat fragmented far-right scene .
" the most important thing is to get into the federal parliament in 2006 , " said klaus beier , the ndp spokesman .
" in the future there will be no more working against one another . "
the npd claims that the far-right could win 7 percent of the vote in a national election , but analysts doubt that will happen .
will the government move to ban the party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a demonstration in august last year , the german federal government failed in its effort to have the country 's highest court ban the ndp .
the court decided to close the case on the grounds that several of the witnesses had ties to germany 's domestic intelligence agency .
the government , however , was successful in foiling ndp plans to hold a massive demonstration in berlin with the xenophobic title " berlin stays german . "
though german interior minister otto schily has said that the government will not make a second attempt to ban the party , the addition of prominent neo-nazis to the party ranks and its attempt to repeat regional successes on the national stage could change that . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?
even though the results did n't come as a surprise , many germans were shocked at the success of extreme right-wing parties celebrating their success in two state elections .
german bloggerville also had something to say .
-lrb- september 23 , 2004 -rrb- german far-right aims for national alliance after scoring a big win in an eastern state poll last weekend , the neo-nazi national democratic party has said it aims to join forces with other far-right parties for the 2006 national election in germany .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures found near srebrenica these actions , in 1992 and 1993 , are seen by some as having played a role in fueling anti-muslim sentiment in the srebrenica enclave before the infamous massacre in july 1995 , the worst case of genocide in europe since world war ii .
pillaging of villages oric also faces charges related to the destruction of villages around srebrenica .
during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

appearing before meps , the former italian minister faced tough questions on his moral convictions , allegiances , the record of his government and his time as an mep .
sometimes ill-tempered , much of the discourse was low on policy substance , focusing on orientation and the commission 's designate vice president 's outlook .
facing criticism over his stated views on homosexuality and marriage , buttiglione ’ s responses - given in english , french , german and italian - appeared to do little to assuage his critics .
he said that homosexuality might be morally wrong , but this has no effects on politics , unless he says homosexuality is a crime .
this brought allegations he had refused to sign legislation in italy on the basis of his moral convictions .
however , he also came under fire for his support for us domestic affairs policies since sept .

the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .
three other military transport planes were standing by to take a further 300 deportees back to libya during the afternoon . " inhumane " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants appear from the german cap anamur aid ship as they dock in the sicilian harbour of porto empedocle , italy in july .
the un high commissioner for refugees as well as the italian opposition have described the large-scale expulsions as " inhumane . "
italian television broadcast graphic images of hundreds of handcuffed refugees in lampedusa herded by policeman into waiting military planes . " the immigrants have been treated without the slightest respect for international conventions , " pietro folena , parliamentarian and member of italy 's largest opposition party , democrats of the left -lrb- ds -rrb- told afp .
" italy 's reputation has been besmirched by an offense against human rights , " folena added . amnesty international and doctors without borders also slammed the deportation , saying it was a " grave violation " of national and international asylum laws . italian stance on refugees laura boldrini , unhcr spokeswoman said that the speeded up deportation process of refugees from lampedusa was shrouded in secrecy . boldrini said the italian authorities made no effort to differentiate between asylum-seeking candidates and economic refugees .
she also pointed out that the authorities did n't even possess equipment for carrying out identification measures such as fingerprints or photographs of the refugees . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu was quoted as saying , " the poor devils -lrb- the refugees -rrb- must know that they will get humanitarian help , but then will be sent back immediately to the place where they came from .

but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .
thus , italy sends rejected refugees after a perfunctory check , back to a country where the basic standards of refugee rights are n't guaranteed , experts complain . in brussels on tuesday , italy 's nominee to become the european union 's justice and home affairs commissioner , rocco buttiglione said he was not aware of any violations .
" if this information is wrong , i 'll be the first one to denounce the situation , " buttiglione told the apcom news agency . unhcr waiting for access to refugees meanwhile on wednesday , the unhcr complained that italian authorities have not yet given the un agency clearance to the around 500 refugees who are still believed to be in lampedusa .

one of the boats carrying the immigrants capsized off the coast of tunisia on monday , killing at least 22 people . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will have a chance to discuss the issue with libyan officials during a short visit on thursday .
berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa . " spain is not favorable to this kind of initiative , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said tuesday .
moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .

the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .
three other military transport planes were standing by to take a further 300 deportees back to libya during the afternoon . " inhumane " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants appear from the german cap anamur aid ship as they dock in the sicilian harbour of porto empedocle , italy in july .
the un high commissioner for refugees as well as the italian opposition have described the large-scale expulsions as " inhumane . "
italian television broadcast graphic images of hundreds of handcuffed refugees in lampedusa herded by policeman into waiting military planes . " the immigrants have been treated without the slightest respect for international conventions , " pietro folena , parliamentarian and member of italy 's largest opposition party , democrats of the left -lrb- ds -rrb- told afp .
" italy 's reputation has been besmirched by an offense against human rights , " folena added . amnesty international and doctors without borders also slammed the deportation , saying it was a " grave violation " of national and international asylum laws . italian stance on refugees laura boldrini , unhcr spokeswoman said that the speeded up deportation process of refugees from lampedusa was shrouded in secrecy . boldrini said the italian authorities made no effort to differentiate between asylum-seeking candidates and economic refugees .
she also pointed out that the authorities did n't even possess equipment for carrying out identification measures such as fingerprints or photographs of the refugees . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu was quoted as saying , " the poor devils -lrb- the refugees -rrb- must know that they will get humanitarian help , but then will be sent back immediately to the place where they came from . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhausted african refugees lie in a boot near the italian island of lampedusa in oct .
2003 .
but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .
thus , italy sends rejected refugees after a perfunctory check , back to a country where the basic standards of refugee rights are n't guaranteed , experts complain . in brussels on tuesday , italy 's nominee to become the european union 's justice and home affairs commissioner , rocco buttiglione said he was not aware of any violations .
" if this information is wrong , i 'll be the first one to denounce the situation , " buttiglione told the apcom news agency . unhcr waiting for access to refugees meanwhile on wednesday , the unhcr complained that italian authorities have not yet given the un agency clearance to the around 500 refugees who are still believed to be in lampedusa . " we are concerned because among the people who have been sent back , there were some who would perhaps have had the right to lodge a request for political asylum , " juergen humburg of the unhcr told afp . over the last two days alone , over a thousand would-be immigrants are said to have landed on italy 's southern coast .
one of the boats carrying the immigrants capsized off the coast of tunisia on monday , killing at least 22 people . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will have a chance to discuss the issue with libyan officials during a short visit on thursday .
berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa . " spain is not favorable to this kind of initiative , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said tuesday .
moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .
the plan is to be discussed at a meeting of eu interior ministers later this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "

however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures found near srebrenica these actions , in 1992 and 1993 , are seen by some as having played a role in fueling anti-muslim sentiment in the srebrenica enclave before the infamous massacre in july 1995 , the worst case of genocide in europe since world war ii .
pillaging of villages oric also faces charges related to the destruction of villages around srebrenica .
during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

the healing power of storytelling culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.10.2004 frankfurt book fair opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations are underway for the start of the frankfurt book fair gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , opened the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .
chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .
bridging two worlds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the arab league will be this year 's special guests .
the organizers and their guests both expressed their hope that the book fair will help bring the arab and western worlds closer together at a time when conflict is rife .
more than 200 authors , artists and politicians from members of the arab league traveled to frankfurt , among them the palestinian mahmud darwish and moroccan tahar ben jelloun .
the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .
but , according to organizers , the presence of arab writers at this year 's book fair is not about increasing sales , but increasing understanding .
raising the profile of german-language writers in addition to the events highlighting the literature of arab countries , a new german book prize modeled on the pulitzer prize in the united states and the prix goncourt in france will be unveiled at this year 's event .
the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .
a jury of five literature experts will be responsible for selecting the winner , and the short list of the first five finalists will be released in september of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : open , sesame !
when the frankfurt book fair opens next week , the guest of honor will be the arab world .
the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in .
-lrb- october 2 , 2004 -rrb- book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all .

the healing power of storytelling culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.10.2004 frankfurt book fair opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations are underway for the start of the frankfurt book fair gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , opened the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .
chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .
bridging two worlds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the arab league will be this year 's special guests .
the organizers and their guests both expressed their hope that the book fair will help bring the arab and western worlds closer together at a time when conflict is rife .
more than 200 authors , artists and politicians from members of the arab league traveled to frankfurt , among them the palestinian mahmud darwish and moroccan tahar ben jelloun .
the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .
but , according to organizers , the presence of arab writers at this year 's book fair is not about increasing sales , but increasing understanding .
raising the profile of german-language writers in addition to the events highlighting the literature of arab countries , a new german book prize modeled on the pulitzer prize in the united states and the prix goncourt in france will be unveiled at this year 's event .
the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .
a jury of five literature experts will be responsible for selecting the winner , and the short list of the first five finalists will be released in september of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : open , sesame !
when the frankfurt book fair opens next week , the guest of honor will be the arab world .
the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in .
-lrb- october 2 , 2004 -rrb- book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .

dw-world looks at how many of the big players see the issue . if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in late 2005 , bringing to head years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
but the issue of turkish membership in the eu has been hotly debated both in brussels and in the member states .
here 's a look at what some of the key players in the debate have to say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan , left , and chancellor schröder germany - chancellor gerhard schröder 's government is one of the most vocal proponents of welcoming turkey into the bloc .
with one eye on germany 's 2.5 million turks , the coalition of social democrats and greens back voting for membership talks at the december summit .
just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. peacekeepers walk along the barbed wires and barrels that mark the " green line " which separates turkish and greek cypriot communities greece - conservative prime minister costas karamanlis is a strong supporter of turkey 's bid , continuing the rapprochement policy of his socialist predecessor , costas simitis .
karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .
spain and sweden as well as new members poland and latvia have also indicated that ankara could expect their support when the final decision is taken in december .

according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
eu officials have also not given a concrete date for turkey 's actual entry .
most estimates , though , indicate that ankara 's road to brussels will extend until well into the next decade , with 15 years the most likely target .
bumpy road to membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's been looking to join the eu for 40 years turkey , an official candidate since 1999 , has been waiting to join the european club for four decades .
but within the european bloc , turkish membership has been a controversial topic , with opinion divided on whether to accept a large , poor and predominantly muslim nation of 70 million with a patchy record on human rights .
" there is clearly the possibility that turkey can become a member , but the negotiations , and this is very important , are open-ended , " agriculture commissioner franz fischler said after the commission made its announcement .
" there is no more ground to be opposed fundamentally to the start of entry talks .
it is also clear that there is still a lot to do , " said fischler ahead of an official statement read in the european parliament .
the report noted ankara had made substantial progress in passing political reforms but still needed to improve implementation , notably in the fight against torture and the protection of fundamental liberties such as the freedom of expression and religion , and rights for women , trade unions and minorities .
" the commission will recommend the suspension of the negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the union is based , " it stated .
an emergency brake turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who was instrumental in pushing through policy reforms to bring his country in line with eu criteria for accession talks , voiced dismay at hints there would be an " emergency brake . "
prior to wednesday 's announcement he told deutsche welle that turkey had " done its homework " and it was now " up to the eu to uphold their end " and proceed with negotiations .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday also rejected any suggestion of " special conditions " for turkey and said the same criteria should apply to his country as to the 10 mostly eastern and southern european members who entered the bloc this past may .
european commission president romano prodi , speaking to reuters on the eve of his outgoing executive 's last major decision , played down the novelty of introducing an " emergency brake " to stop talks if ankara slipped on key standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani prodi , european commission president " we have to be sure that turkey will be like any of the other member states in case they come in , " he said , insisting the commission would apply the same standards to ankara 's bid as it did to all previous applicants .
" do n't you think there were clearly built-in emergency brakes in all the negotiations we had ? " he said .
special conditions for turkey in its report the commission also recommended the eu consider implementing permanent safeguards that would curb migrant labor from turkey , as well as agree to " specific arrangements " before ankara benefits fully from eu farm subsidies and regional aid .
an impact study leaked to the press ahead of the commission 's announcement revealed that between 500,000 and four million turkish migrants a year could move into the rest of the eu after membership , and that yearly subsidies of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- would be required to bring turkey 's agriculture and infrastructure up to par with the rest of the bloc .
despite these concerns , prodi said europe had no reason to fear turkey 's membership : " europe with a constitution , with strong institutions and affirmed policies for a strong model of peace and economic well being , has nothing to fear from the accession of turkey , " he told the european parliament . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth while turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan and the rest of turkey wait to hear from europe 's leaders , dw-world takes a look at the issues that effect the country 's connection to europe .

according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
eu officials have also not given a concrete date for turkey 's actual entry .
most estimates , though , indicate that ankara 's road to brussels will extend until well into the next decade , with 15 years the most likely target .
bumpy road to membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's been looking to join the eu for 40 years turkey , an official candidate since 1999 , has been waiting to join the european club for four decades .
but within the european bloc , turkish membership has been a controversial topic , with opinion divided on whether to accept a large , poor and predominantly muslim nation of 70 million with a patchy record on human rights .
" there is clearly the possibility that turkey can become a member , but the negotiations , and this is very important , are open-ended , " agriculture commissioner franz fischler said after the commission made its announcement .
" there is no more ground to be opposed fundamentally to the start of entry talks .
it is also clear that there is still a lot to do , " said fischler ahead of an official statement read in the european parliament .
the report noted ankara had made substantial progress in passing political reforms but still needed to improve implementation , notably in the fight against torture and the protection of fundamental liberties such as the freedom of expression and religion , and rights for women , trade unions and minorities .
" the commission will recommend the suspension of the negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the union is based , " it stated .
an emergency brake turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who was instrumental in pushing through policy reforms to bring his country in line with eu criteria for accession talks , voiced dismay at hints there would be an " emergency brake . "
prior to wednesday 's announcement he told deutsche welle that turkey had " done its homework " and it was now " up to the eu to uphold their end " and proceed with negotiations .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday also rejected any suggestion of " special conditions " for turkey and said the same criteria should apply to his country as to the 10 mostly eastern and southern european members who entered the bloc this past may .

" do n't you think there were clearly built-in emergency brakes in all the negotiations we had ? " he said .
special conditions for turkey in its report the commission also recommended the eu consider implementing permanent safeguards that would curb migrant labor from turkey , as well as agree to " specific arrangements " before ankara benefits fully from eu farm subsidies and regional aid .
an impact study leaked to the press ahead of the commission 's announcement revealed that between 500,000 and four million turkish migrants a year could move into the rest of the eu after membership , and that yearly subsidies of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- would be required to bring turkey 's agriculture and infrastructure up to par with the rest of the bloc .

eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said , " the obligation on any member state that breaches the rules to take prompt corrective action still stands . "
he stressed that countries still need to keep budget deficits below three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- and debt levels below 60 percent of gdp .
paris and berlin have broken these rules for three consecutive years , but both have pledged to creep back under the ceiling in 2005 .
the problems caused by the euro rules have forced the commission to consider ways to reform the pact .
in future , brussels intends to place much greater emphasis on debt and take individual countries ' economic situations into account .
overall , the commission 's assessment of the economic situation in the euro area was relatively positive .
growth has progressed " slightly faster than expected " and " should continue to expand at a similar pace throughout the rest of this year , " according to the report .
despite this , the document warns , " there are no grounds for complacency .
the recovery still looks relatively timid . "

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .
" what olli did was by no means ok , " raged bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we told olli that actions such as that endanger his reputation . "
even kahn 's goalkeeping coach and long-term friend , sepp maier , put the boot in .
" that was a stupid thing he did with klose , " maier told munich newspaper az .
" he should know that himself . "
bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .
kahn has a reputation for having a short fuse and he earned the unwanted nickname ' genghis kahn ' after a kung-fu kick attack on borussia dortmund 's stephane chapuisat in april 1999 .
but germany coach jürgen klinsmann was unaffacted by the incident claiming it was part and parcel of soccer .

" i do not think two international team-mates going for one another should be blown up , " said klinsmann .
" it is an emotional moment that can happen in the match .
that will also happen two months before the world cup . "
klose and kahn will avoid one another when germany face iran on saturday in tehran with klinsmann opting to rest kahn and hand a starting chance to arsenal 's jens lehmann .
eager lehmann earlier this week , lehmann said he would be in goal for germany for the 2006 world cup campaign leaving bayern munich 's oliver kahn warming the substitutes ' bench .
the former borussia dortmund custodian vowed to put kahn in the shade during his match against iran .
" i am convinced that i will be in goal for the 2006 world cup , " insisted lehmann in magazine kicker .
" i am at the peak of my career in terms of experience and sporting ability . "
bayern shot-stopper kahn was stripped of the captaincy by klinsmann , with michael ballack favored , and lehmann believes his chances are improved with kahn no longer guaranteed a place in the starting line-up .
" the captain has to play so a goalkeeper as captain is not the best idea , " added lehmann .
" for me it was awful to be in competition with someone who has a 40 percent advantage because he is captain . "
kahn has been first choice goalkeeper for the german national team since the tail end of 1996 winning 74 caps while lehmann has just 19 .
but the arsenal goalkeeper dreams of lifting the world cup crown in germany and insists it is not too much to expect despite the disastrous first round exit at euro 2004 . " france are going through a transitional phase , " he explained .

dw-world looks at how many of the big players see the issue . if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in late 2005 , bringing to head years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
but the issue of turkish membership in the eu has been hotly debated both in brussels and in the member states .
here 's a look at what some of the key players in the debate have to say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan , left , and chancellor schröder germany - chancellor gerhard schröder 's government is one of the most vocal proponents of welcoming turkey into the bloc .
with one eye on germany 's 2.5 million turks , the coalition of social democrats and greens back voting for membership talks at the december summit .
just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. peacekeepers walk along the barbed wires and barrels that mark the " green line " which separates turkish and greek cypriot communities greece - conservative prime minister costas karamanlis is a strong supporter of turkey 's bid , continuing the rapprochement policy of his socialist predecessor , costas simitis .
karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .
spain and sweden as well as new members poland and latvia have also indicated that ankara could expect their support when the final decision is taken in december .

with one eye on germany 's 2.5 million turks , the coalition of social democrats and greens back voting for membership talks at the december summit .
just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. peacekeepers walk along the barbed wires and barrels that mark the " green line " which separates turkish and greek cypriot communities greece - conservative prime minister costas karamanlis is a strong supporter of turkey 's bid , continuing the rapprochement policy of his socialist predecessor , costas simitis .
karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .
spain and sweden as well as new members poland and latvia have also indicated that ankara could expect their support when the final decision is taken in december .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , however , has urged caution . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth dw-world looks at the transformation of turkey on its road to brussels and the intense debate surrounding membership .

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .
" what olli did was by no means ok , " raged bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we told olli that actions such as that endanger his reputation . "
even kahn 's goalkeeping coach and long-term friend , sepp maier , put the boot in .
" that was a stupid thing he did with klose , " maier told munich newspaper az .
" he should know that himself . "
bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .
kahn has a reputation for having a short fuse and he earned the unwanted nickname ' genghis kahn ' after a kung-fu kick attack on borussia dortmund 's stephane chapuisat in april 1999 .
but germany coach jürgen klinsmann was unaffacted by the incident claiming it was part and parcel of soccer .

" i do not think two international team-mates going for one another should be blown up , " said klinsmann .
" it is an emotional moment that can happen in the match .
that will also happen two months before the world cup . "
klose and kahn will avoid one another when germany face iran on saturday in tehran with klinsmann opting to rest kahn and hand a starting chance to arsenal 's jens lehmann .
eager lehmann earlier this week , lehmann said he would be in goal for germany for the 2006 world cup campaign leaving bayern munich 's oliver kahn warming the substitutes ' bench .
the former borussia dortmund custodian vowed to put kahn in the shade during his match against iran .
" i am convinced that i will be in goal for the 2006 world cup , " insisted lehmann in magazine kicker .
" i am at the peak of my career in terms of experience and sporting ability . "
bayern shot-stopper kahn was stripped of the captaincy by klinsmann , with michael ballack favored , and lehmann believes his chances are improved with kahn no longer guaranteed a place in the starting line-up .
" the captain has to play so a goalkeeper as captain is not the best idea , " added lehmann .
" for me it was awful to be in competition with someone who has a 40 percent advantage because he is captain . "
kahn has been first choice goalkeeper for the german national team since the tail end of 1996 winning 74 caps while lehmann has just 19 .
but the arsenal goalkeeper dreams of lifting the world cup crown in germany and insists it is not too much to expect despite the disastrous first round exit at euro 2004 . " france are going through a transitional phase , " he explained .

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .
" what olli did was by no means ok , " raged bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we told olli that actions such as that endanger his reputation . "
even kahn 's goalkeeping coach and long-term friend , sepp maier , put the boot in .
" that was a stupid thing he did with klose , " maier told munich newspaper az .
" he should know that himself . "
bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .
kahn has a reputation for having a short fuse and he earned the unwanted nickname ' genghis kahn ' after a kung-fu kick attack on borussia dortmund 's stephane chapuisat in april 1999 .
but germany coach jürgen klinsmann was unaffacted by the incident claiming it was part and parcel of soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : something in your nose , miro ?
" i do not think two international team-mates going for one another should be blown up , " said klinsmann .
" it is an emotional moment that can happen in the match .
that will also happen two months before the world cup . "
klose and kahn will avoid one another when germany face iran on saturday in tehran with klinsmann opting to rest kahn and hand a starting chance to arsenal 's jens lehmann .
eager lehmann earlier this week , lehmann said he would be in goal for germany for the 2006 world cup campaign leaving bayern munich 's oliver kahn warming the substitutes ' bench .
the former borussia dortmund custodian vowed to put kahn in the shade during his match against iran .
" i am convinced that i will be in goal for the 2006 world cup , " insisted lehmann in magazine kicker .
" i am at the peak of my career in terms of experience and sporting ability . "
bayern shot-stopper kahn was stripped of the captaincy by klinsmann , with michael ballack favored , and lehmann believes his chances are improved with kahn no longer guaranteed a place in the starting line-up .
" the captain has to play so a goalkeeper as captain is not the best idea , " added lehmann .
" for me it was awful to be in competition with someone who has a 40 percent advantage because he is captain . "
kahn has been first choice goalkeeper for the german national team since the tail end of 1996 winning 74 caps while lehmann has just 19 .
but the arsenal goalkeeper dreams of lifting the world cup crown in germany and insists it is not too much to expect despite the disastrous first round exit at euro 2004 . " france are going through a transitional phase , " he explained .
" england , the netherlands and italy are hardly world beaters , although brazil are a very strong team .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .
anyone who earns more than that can opt out .
this opt-out option presents a twofold risk , lauterbach said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with insurance , healthcare clients still have to shell out a copayment " on the one hand the groups engaged by the state to provide insurance lose premiums , " he said .
" on the other hand , the costs of illness have gotten so high that no one can afford to pay them alone . "
even people who earn very high salaries are effected when they opt out of insurance altogether , he said .
mess in the us lauterbach cited the united states as an example of the risks both individuals and society can take when health care is privatized .
some 120 million us citizens - 40 percent of the population - are either uninsured or underinsured .
of these , 44 million have no insurance protection whatsoever , while the rest are only partly insured .
" many us citizens ca n't afford adequate insurance and thus do n't get insurance for illnesses they may already have , " lauterbach said .
another case in point is the young , healthy americans who are in the middle of building up companies and families .
" they often have to opt to be uninsured purely on the basis of cost , " lauterbach said . " then if they get sick , it can lead to them losing their business .

the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .
three other military transport planes were standing by to take a further 300 deportees back to libya during the afternoon . " inhumane " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants appear from the german cap anamur aid ship as they dock in the sicilian harbour of porto empedocle , italy in july .
the un high commissioner for refugees as well as the italian opposition have described the large-scale expulsions as " inhumane . "
italian television broadcast graphic images of hundreds of handcuffed refugees in lampedusa herded by policeman into waiting military planes . " the immigrants have been treated without the slightest respect for international conventions , " pietro folena , parliamentarian and member of italy 's largest opposition party , democrats of the left -lrb- ds -rrb- told afp .
" italy 's reputation has been besmirched by an offense against human rights , " folena added . amnesty international and doctors without borders also slammed the deportation , saying it was a " grave violation " of national and international asylum laws . italian stance on refugees laura boldrini , unhcr spokeswoman said that the speeded up deportation process of refugees from lampedusa was shrouded in secrecy . boldrini said the italian authorities made no effort to differentiate between asylum-seeking candidates and economic refugees .
she also pointed out that the authorities did n't even possess equipment for carrying out identification measures such as fingerprints or photographs of the refugees . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu was quoted as saying , " the poor devils -lrb- the refugees -rrb- must know that they will get humanitarian help , but then will be sent back immediately to the place where they came from . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhausted african refugees lie in a boot near the italian island of lampedusa in oct .
2003 .
but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .
thus , italy sends rejected refugees after a perfunctory check , back to a country where the basic standards of refugee rights are n't guaranteed , experts complain . in brussels on tuesday , italy 's nominee to become the european union 's justice and home affairs commissioner , rocco buttiglione said he was not aware of any violations .
" if this information is wrong , i 'll be the first one to denounce the situation , " buttiglione told the apcom news agency . unhcr waiting for access to refugees meanwhile on wednesday , the unhcr complained that italian authorities have not yet given the un agency clearance to the around 500 refugees who are still believed to be in lampedusa . " we are concerned because among the people who have been sent back , there were some who would perhaps have had the right to lodge a request for political asylum , " juergen humburg of the unhcr told afp . over the last two days alone , over a thousand would-be immigrants are said to have landed on italy 's southern coast .
one of the boats carrying the immigrants capsized off the coast of tunisia on monday , killing at least 22 people . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will have a chance to discuss the issue with libyan officials during a short visit on thursday .
berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa . " spain is not favorable to this kind of initiative , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said tuesday .
moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .
the plan is to be discussed at a meeting of eu interior ministers later this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .
anyone who earns more than that can opt out .
this opt-out option presents a twofold risk , lauterbach said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with insurance , healthcare clients still have to shell out a copayment " on the one hand the groups engaged by the state to provide insurance lose premiums , " he said .
" on the other hand , the costs of illness have gotten so high that no one can afford to pay them alone . "
even people who earn very high salaries are effected when they opt out of insurance altogether , he said .
mess in the us lauterbach cited the united states as an example of the risks both individuals and society can take when health care is privatized .
some 120 million us citizens - 40 percent of the population - are either uninsured or underinsured .
of these , 44 million have no insurance protection whatsoever , while the rest are only partly insured .
" many us citizens ca n't afford adequate insurance and thus do n't get insurance for illnesses they may already have , " lauterbach said .
another case in point is the young , healthy americans who are in the middle of building up companies and families .
" they often have to opt to be uninsured purely on the basis of cost , " lauterbach said . " then if they get sick , it can lead to them losing their business .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .

" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .

protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .

dw-world looks at how many of the big players see the issue . if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in late 2005 , bringing to head years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
but the issue of turkish membership in the eu has been hotly debated both in brussels and in the member states .
here 's a look at what some of the key players in the debate have to say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan , left , and chancellor schröder germany - chancellor gerhard schröder 's government is one of the most vocal proponents of welcoming turkey into the bloc .
with one eye on germany 's 2.5 million turks , the coalition of social democrats and greens back voting for membership talks at the december summit .
just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. peacekeepers walk along the barbed wires and barrels that mark the " green line " which separates turkish and greek cypriot communities greece - conservative prime minister costas karamanlis is a strong supporter of turkey 's bid , continuing the rapprochement policy of his socialist predecessor , costas simitis .
karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .
spain and sweden as well as new members poland and latvia have also indicated that ankara could expect their support when the final decision is taken in december .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .
those reforms included abolishing the death penalty , eliminating state security courts , adopting a " zero-tolerance policy " toward torture and reigning in the power of the military , which has seized power in turkey several times in recent decades , " in conformity with democratic norms , " he said .
he also said turkey will join the international criminal court .
" we hope to bring a long-traveled road to its final lap with the initiation of accession negotiations in the first half of 2005 , " he told the parliamentary committee of the council of europe , a group formed in 1949 to promote human rights and democracy in europe , but with no formal link to the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with eu commission president romano prodi in brussels erdogan added that he hoped that the accession talks would not drag on indefinitely , reflecting turkey 's frustration at its perception that the european bloc has been hinting at membership for decades but hardly moving in that direction .
" turkish membership will not be achieved overnight , " he said but added that his government expects to " conclude this phase within a reasonable amount of time . "
a decade or more while the eu 's head office formally recommended in a report on wednesday that talks begin with turkey , eu heads of state will make the final decision at their dec .
17 summit .
but even if the decision is favorable to turkey soon , officials have suggested negotiations could last a decade or more .
president jacques chirac of france , who is hanoi , vietnam where he will attend an asia-europe summit , said the process was only at the very beginning .
" if the european commission decides in december to open those negotiations , everybody is aware that these negotiations could last at the minimum between 10 and 15 years , " he told reporters .

erdogan told reporters on wednesday that has said he understands the concerns the european commission might have about allowing turkey to join , but added that he does not expect special treatment .
" we expect to be subject to the same rules and conditions as other candidates , " he said .
german reaction in germany , opinion was split on the recommendation by the european commission that accession talks begin .
chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a visit to india , said he welcomed the recommendation by the commission and that germany would vote yes at the december meeting .
foreign minister joschka fischer was also positive about the commission 's report , saying the time frame of 10 to 15 years until actual membership was realistic .
however , conservative leader angela merkel of the christian democrats , was less enthusiastic , saying her party prefers offering turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .
germany industry and trade associations hailed the progress toward membership talks as a positive development .
according to the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the german economy could benefit from turkey 's membership , especially since turkey is a growth economy with strong strategic potential for german firms .

the healing power of storytelling culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.10.2004 frankfurt book fair opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations are underway for the start of the frankfurt book fair gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , opened the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .
chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .
bridging two worlds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the arab league will be this year 's special guests .
the organizers and their guests both expressed their hope that the book fair will help bring the arab and western worlds closer together at a time when conflict is rife .
more than 200 authors , artists and politicians from members of the arab league traveled to frankfurt , among them the palestinian mahmud darwish and moroccan tahar ben jelloun .
the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .
but , according to organizers , the presence of arab writers at this year 's book fair is not about increasing sales , but increasing understanding .
raising the profile of german-language writers in addition to the events highlighting the literature of arab countries , a new german book prize modeled on the pulitzer prize in the united states and the prix goncourt in france will be unveiled at this year 's event .
the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .
a jury of five literature experts will be responsible for selecting the winner , and the short list of the first five finalists will be released in september of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : open , sesame !

chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .
those reforms included abolishing the death penalty , eliminating state security courts , adopting a " zero-tolerance policy " toward torture and reigning in the power of the military , which has seized power in turkey several times in recent decades , " in conformity with democratic norms , " he said .
he also said turkey will join the international criminal court .
" we hope to bring a long-traveled road to its final lap with the initiation of accession negotiations in the first half of 2005 , " he told the parliamentary committee of the council of europe , a group formed in 1949 to promote human rights and democracy in europe , but with no formal link to the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with eu commission president romano prodi in brussels erdogan added that he hoped that the accession talks would not drag on indefinitely , reflecting turkey 's frustration at its perception that the european bloc has been hinting at membership for decades but hardly moving in that direction .
" turkish membership will not be achieved overnight , " he said but added that his government expects to " conclude this phase within a reasonable amount of time . "
a decade or more while the eu 's head office formally recommended in a report on wednesday that talks begin with turkey , eu heads of state will make the final decision at their dec .
17 summit .
but even if the decision is favorable to turkey soon , officials have suggested negotiations could last a decade or more .
president jacques chirac of france , who is hanoi , vietnam where he will attend an asia-europe summit , said the process was only at the very beginning .
" if the european commission decides in december to open those negotiations , everybody is aware that these negotiations could last at the minimum between 10 and 15 years , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish men fish on the galata bridge in istanbul , with the ottoman era new mosque in the background many europeans , including some commissioners , have reservations about admitting turkey , an overwhelmingly muslim country of 71 million , to the eu .
erdogan told reporters on wednesday that has said he understands the concerns the european commission might have about allowing turkey to join , but added that he does not expect special treatment .
" we expect to be subject to the same rules and conditions as other candidates , " he said .
german reaction in germany , opinion was split on the recommendation by the european commission that accession talks begin .
chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a visit to india , said he welcomed the recommendation by the commission and that germany would vote yes at the december meeting .
foreign minister joschka fischer was also positive about the commission 's report , saying the time frame of 10 to 15 years until actual membership was realistic .
however , conservative leader angela merkel of the christian democrats , was less enthusiastic , saying her party prefers offering turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .
germany industry and trade associations hailed the progress toward membership talks as a positive development .
according to the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the german economy could benefit from turkey 's membership , especially since turkey is a growth economy with strong strategic potential for german firms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey " a change in mentality is needed " waiting for eu capturing turkish culture 's changing face europe -pipe- 06.10.2004 turkey gets green light from brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's erdogan gets the eu commission 's blessing the european commission has approved starting eu accession negotiations with turkey .
according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
eu officials have also not given a concrete date for turkey 's actual entry .
most estimates , though , indicate that ankara 's road to brussels will extend until well into the next decade , with 15 years the most likely target .
bumpy road to membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's been looking to join the eu for 40 years turkey , an official candidate since 1999 , has been waiting to join the european club for four decades .
but within the european bloc , turkish membership has been a controversial topic , with opinion divided on whether to accept a large , poor and predominantly muslim nation of 70 million with a patchy record on human rights .
" there is clearly the possibility that turkey can become a member , but the negotiations , and this is very important , are open-ended , " agriculture commissioner franz fischler said after the commission made its announcement .
" there is no more ground to be opposed fundamentally to the start of entry talks .
it is also clear that there is still a lot to do , " said fischler ahead of an official statement read in the european parliament .
the report noted ankara had made substantial progress in passing political reforms but still needed to improve implementation , notably in the fight against torture and the protection of fundamental liberties such as the freedom of expression and religion , and rights for women , trade unions and minorities .
" the commission will recommend the suspension of the negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the union is based , " it stated .
an emergency brake turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who was instrumental in pushing through policy reforms to bring his country in line with eu criteria for accession talks , voiced dismay at hints there would be an " emergency brake . "
prior to wednesday 's announcement he told deutsche welle that turkey had " done its homework " and it was now " up to the eu to uphold their end " and proceed with negotiations .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday also rejected any suggestion of " special conditions " for turkey and said the same criteria should apply to his country as to the 10 mostly eastern and southern european members who entered the bloc this past may .
european commission president romano prodi , speaking to reuters on the eve of his outgoing executive 's last major decision , played down the novelty of introducing an " emergency brake " to stop talks if ankara slipped on key standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani prodi , european commission president " we have to be sure that turkey will be like any of the other member states in case they come in , " he said , insisting the commission would apply the same standards to ankara 's bid as it did to all previous applicants .
" do n't you think there were clearly built-in emergency brakes in all the negotiations we had ? " he said .
special conditions for turkey in its report the commission also recommended the eu consider implementing permanent safeguards that would curb migrant labor from turkey , as well as agree to " specific arrangements " before ankara benefits fully from eu farm subsidies and regional aid .
an impact study leaked to the press ahead of the commission 's announcement revealed that between 500,000 and four million turkish migrants a year could move into the rest of the eu after membership , and that yearly subsidies of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- would be required to bring turkey 's agriculture and infrastructure up to par with the rest of the bloc .
despite these concerns , prodi said europe had no reason to fear turkey 's membership : " europe with a constitution , with strong institutions and affirmed policies for a strong model of peace and economic well being , has nothing to fear from the accession of turkey , " he told the european parliament . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth while turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan and the rest of turkey wait to hear from europe 's leaders , dw-world takes a look at the issues that effect the country 's connection to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.10.2004 far-right party recruits neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the march forward : ndp leaders are looking to enter national politics emboldened by recent regional election gains , germany 's far-right ndp party is pressing on .
with an eye on upcoming national elections , the party has recruited prominent neo-nazis for top leadership positions . germany 's far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which made headlines last month when it won 9.2 percent of the vote in regional elections in the eastern state of saxony , is pressing on with its efforts to enter the national government .
looking ahead to upcoming federal elections in 2006 , the npd has recruited two prominent neo-nazis for high-ranking leadership positions .
the move is part of a larger plan to create a " people 's front " from the right .
npd leader udo voigt is also scheduled to meet with gerhard frey , the leader of the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , another far right party that snagged 6.1 percent of the vote in brandenburg during the same regional elections , for talks focused on a possible alliance .
prominent neo-nazis join the ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters demonstrated against banning the party in recruiting thomas wulff and thorsten heise onto the ndp 's board of directors - a move which will be officially announced at the party 's conference at the end of october - the ndp will gain two prominent members of the neo-nazi movement with a strong regional following and national profile .
wulff directs the far-right scene in hamburg , and heise is active in thüringen .
their appointment could mobilize additional far-right voters and facilitate the ndp 's grab for power and influence at the national level - or so the ndp leadership hopes .
by pushing for alliances , the ndp is , in effect , serving as the unifier of germany 's previously somewhat fragmented far-right scene .
" the most important thing is to get into the federal parliament in 2006 , " said klaus beier , the ndp spokesman .
" in the future there will be no more working against one another . "
the npd claims that the far-right could win 7 percent of the vote in a national election , but analysts doubt that will happen .
will the government move to ban the party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a demonstration in august last year , the german federal government failed in its effort to have the country 's highest court ban the ndp .
the court decided to close the case on the grounds that several of the witnesses had ties to germany 's domestic intelligence agency .
the government , however , was successful in foiling ndp plans to hold a massive demonstration in berlin with the xenophobic title " berlin stays german . "
though german interior minister otto schily has said that the government will not make a second attempt to ban the party , the addition of prominent neo-nazis to the party ranks and its attempt to repeat regional successes on the national stage could change that . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?
even though the results did n't come as a surprise , many germans were shocked at the success of extreme right-wing parties celebrating their success in two state elections .
german bloggerville also had something to say .
-lrb- september 23 , 2004 -rrb- german far-right aims for national alliance after scoring a big win in an eastern state poll last weekend , the neo-nazi national democratic party has said it aims to join forces with other far-right parties for the 2006 national election in germany .
-lrb- september 22 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .
those reforms included abolishing the death penalty , eliminating state security courts , adopting a " zero-tolerance policy " toward torture and reigning in the power of the military , which has seized power in turkey several times in recent decades , " in conformity with democratic norms , " he said .
he also said turkey will join the international criminal court .
" we hope to bring a long-traveled road to its final lap with the initiation of accession negotiations in the first half of 2005 , " he told the parliamentary committee of the council of europe , a group formed in 1949 to promote human rights and democracy in europe , but with no formal link to the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with eu commission president romano prodi in brussels erdogan added that he hoped that the accession talks would not drag on indefinitely , reflecting turkey 's frustration at its perception that the european bloc has been hinting at membership for decades but hardly moving in that direction .
" turkish membership will not be achieved overnight , " he said but added that his government expects to " conclude this phase within a reasonable amount of time . "
a decade or more while the eu 's head office formally recommended in a report on wednesday that talks begin with turkey , eu heads of state will make the final decision at their dec .
17 summit .
but even if the decision is favorable to turkey soon , officials have suggested negotiations could last a decade or more .
president jacques chirac of france , who is hanoi , vietnam where he will attend an asia-europe summit , said the process was only at the very beginning .
" if the european commission decides in december to open those negotiations , everybody is aware that these negotiations could last at the minimum between 10 and 15 years , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish men fish on the galata bridge in istanbul , with the ottoman era new mosque in the background many europeans , including some commissioners , have reservations about admitting turkey , an overwhelmingly muslim country of 71 million , to the eu .
erdogan told reporters on wednesday that has said he understands the concerns the european commission might have about allowing turkey to join , but added that he does not expect special treatment .
" we expect to be subject to the same rules and conditions as other candidates , " he said .
german reaction in germany , opinion was split on the recommendation by the european commission that accession talks begin .
chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a visit to india , said he welcomed the recommendation by the commission and that germany would vote yes at the december meeting .
foreign minister joschka fischer was also positive about the commission 's report , saying the time frame of 10 to 15 years until actual membership was realistic .
however , conservative leader angela merkel of the christian democrats , was less enthusiastic , saying her party prefers offering turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .
germany industry and trade associations hailed the progress toward membership talks as a positive development .
according to the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the german economy could benefit from turkey 's membership , especially since turkey is a growth economy with strong strategic potential for german firms .

the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .
three other military transport planes were standing by to take a further 300 deportees back to libya during the afternoon . " inhumane " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants appear from the german cap anamur aid ship as they dock in the sicilian harbour of porto empedocle , italy in july .
the un high commissioner for refugees as well as the italian opposition have described the large-scale expulsions as " inhumane . "
italian television broadcast graphic images of hundreds of handcuffed refugees in lampedusa herded by policeman into waiting military planes . " the immigrants have been treated without the slightest respect for international conventions , " pietro folena , parliamentarian and member of italy 's largest opposition party , democrats of the left -lrb- ds -rrb- told afp .
" italy 's reputation has been besmirched by an offense against human rights , " folena added . amnesty international and doctors without borders also slammed the deportation , saying it was a " grave violation " of national and international asylum laws . italian stance on refugees laura boldrini , unhcr spokeswoman said that the speeded up deportation process of refugees from lampedusa was shrouded in secrecy . boldrini said the italian authorities made no effort to differentiate between asylum-seeking candidates and economic refugees .
she also pointed out that the authorities did n't even possess equipment for carrying out identification measures such as fingerprints or photographs of the refugees . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu was quoted as saying , " the poor devils -lrb- the refugees -rrb- must know that they will get humanitarian help , but then will be sent back immediately to the place where they came from . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhausted african refugees lie in a boot near the italian island of lampedusa in oct .
2003 .
but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .
thus , italy sends rejected refugees after a perfunctory check , back to a country where the basic standards of refugee rights are n't guaranteed , experts complain . in brussels on tuesday , italy 's nominee to become the european union 's justice and home affairs commissioner , rocco buttiglione said he was not aware of any violations .
" if this information is wrong , i 'll be the first one to denounce the situation , " buttiglione told the apcom news agency . unhcr waiting for access to refugees meanwhile on wednesday , the unhcr complained that italian authorities have not yet given the un agency clearance to the around 500 refugees who are still believed to be in lampedusa . " we are concerned because among the people who have been sent back , there were some who would perhaps have had the right to lodge a request for political asylum , " juergen humburg of the unhcr told afp . over the last two days alone , over a thousand would-be immigrants are said to have landed on italy 's southern coast .
one of the boats carrying the immigrants capsized off the coast of tunisia on monday , killing at least 22 people . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will have a chance to discuss the issue with libyan officials during a short visit on thursday .
berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa . " spain is not favorable to this kind of initiative , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said tuesday .
moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .
the plan is to be discussed at a meeting of eu interior ministers later this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off negotiations at opel continue opinion : blame the managers , not the country business -pipe- 06.10.2004 germany 's crippled city centers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if big downtown stores go under , so could their smaller neighbors germany 's largest department store chain , karstadt , has announced it might close 77 of its stores , primarily in smaller cities and towns .
some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country . " we started seeing town centers begin emptying out in the mid 1990s , " beate glöckner of the irs institute for regional development and structural planning told dw-world .
" the trend has begun to accelerate . " now city planners and demographers fear that the karstadt closings could mean that vicious circle is about spread to even more municipalities . " it can be the beginning of the decay of a town 's infrastructure , " reiner klingholz , director of the berlin institute for world population and global development , told dw-world .
" certain shops close , windows are shuttered , and this makes the place unattractive , not just for shoppers and existing businesses , but for new businesses as well . " the karstadt store in the bavarian town of deggendorf is one of the outlets threatened with closure .
while the news has the store 's 120 employees worried about their careers , it also has surrounding businesses fearing for their own futures . " it 's terrible , " sait ögütmen , owner of a snack bar next to the department store , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" the whole square here will deteriorate . " the " wal-mart " effect in fact , more and more often in germany , new businesses are avoiding town centers and choosing to set up shop in the open countryside on the outskirts of town .
already , only around a third of retail establishments in germany are in town centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart stores in the united states do a booming business it 's a similar phenomenon to the wal-mart story in the united states .
now the world 's largest store chain , wal-mart embarked on a massive expansion course in the 1990s , setting up its warehouse-like stores in former farm fields , where it could offer customers plenty of free parking and a huge selection of merchandise , often at rock-bottom prices . the result , however , was that smaller mom-and-pop stores up and down main street in small-town america could not compete and were forced out of business .
today , many stores in traditional small town centers are boarded up while the real centers of retail activity have shifted to the conglomerations outside the town limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea store in germany germany is seeing a similar development and the success stories on the german retail landscape , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , electronics superstore mediamarkt or the booming home improvement stores are enthusiastically following the new concept . " they 've developed whole shopping centers , offering acres of parking and a conglomeration of stores close to one another , " blanek said .
" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .
" there are other possibilities they can use to bring shoppers back .

the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .

but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .
thus , italy sends rejected refugees after a perfunctory check , back to a country where the basic standards of refugee rights are n't guaranteed , experts complain . in brussels on tuesday , italy 's nominee to become the european union 's justice and home affairs commissioner , rocco buttiglione said he was not aware of any violations .

berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa .

but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .
thus , italy sends rejected refugees after a perfunctory check , back to a country where the basic standards of refugee rights are n't guaranteed , experts complain . in brussels on tuesday , italy 's nominee to become the european union 's justice and home affairs commissioner , rocco buttiglione said he was not aware of any violations .
" if this information is wrong , i 'll be the first one to denounce the situation , " buttiglione told the apcom news agency . unhcr waiting for access to refugees meanwhile on wednesday , the unhcr complained that italian authorities have not yet given the un agency clearance to the around 500 refugees who are still believed to be in lampedusa .

one of the boats carrying the immigrants capsized off the coast of tunisia on monday , killing at least 22 people . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will have a chance to discuss the issue with libyan officials during a short visit on thursday .
berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa . " spain is not favorable to this kind of initiative , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said tuesday .
moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .

the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .
three other military transport planes were standing by to take a further 300 deportees back to libya during the afternoon . " inhumane " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants appear from the german cap anamur aid ship as they dock in the sicilian harbour of porto empedocle , italy in july .
the un high commissioner for refugees as well as the italian opposition have described the large-scale expulsions as " inhumane . "
italian television broadcast graphic images of hundreds of handcuffed refugees in lampedusa herded by policeman into waiting military planes . " the immigrants have been treated without the slightest respect for international conventions , " pietro folena , parliamentarian and member of italy 's largest opposition party , democrats of the left -lrb- ds -rrb- told afp .
" italy 's reputation has been besmirched by an offense against human rights , " folena added . amnesty international and doctors without borders also slammed the deportation , saying it was a " grave violation " of national and international asylum laws . italian stance on refugees laura boldrini , unhcr spokeswoman said that the speeded up deportation process of refugees from lampedusa was shrouded in secrecy . boldrini said the italian authorities made no effort to differentiate between asylum-seeking candidates and economic refugees .
she also pointed out that the authorities did n't even possess equipment for carrying out identification measures such as fingerprints or photographs of the refugees . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu was quoted as saying , " the poor devils -lrb- the refugees -rrb- must know that they will get humanitarian help , but then will be sent back immediately to the place where they came from .

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .

" we told olli that actions such as that endanger his reputation . "
even kahn 's goalkeeping coach and long-term friend , sepp maier , put the boot in .

" he should know that himself . "
bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .

" i am convinced that i will be in goal for the 2006 world cup , " insisted lehmann in magazine kicker .

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .
" what olli did was by no means ok , " raged bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we told olli that actions such as that endanger his reputation . "
even kahn 's goalkeeping coach and long-term friend , sepp maier , put the boot in .
" that was a stupid thing he did with klose , " maier told munich newspaper az .
" he should know that himself . "
bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .
kahn has a reputation for having a short fuse and he earned the unwanted nickname ' genghis kahn ' after a kung-fu kick attack on borussia dortmund 's stephane chapuisat in april 1999 .
but germany coach jürgen klinsmann was unaffacted by the incident claiming it was part and parcel of soccer .

" i do not think two international team-mates going for one another should be blown up , " said klinsmann .
" it is an emotional moment that can happen in the match .
that will also happen two months before the world cup . "
klose and kahn will avoid one another when germany face iran on saturday in tehran with klinsmann opting to rest kahn and hand a starting chance to arsenal 's jens lehmann .
eager lehmann earlier this week , lehmann said he would be in goal for germany for the 2006 world cup campaign leaving bayern munich 's oliver kahn warming the substitutes ' bench .
the former borussia dortmund custodian vowed to put kahn in the shade during his match against iran .
" i am convinced that i will be in goal for the 2006 world cup , " insisted lehmann in magazine kicker .
" i am at the peak of my career in terms of experience and sporting ability . "
bayern shot-stopper kahn was stripped of the captaincy by klinsmann , with michael ballack favored , and lehmann believes his chances are improved with kahn no longer guaranteed a place in the starting line-up .
" the captain has to play so a goalkeeper as captain is not the best idea , " added lehmann .
" for me it was awful to be in competition with someone who has a 40 percent advantage because he is captain . "
kahn has been first choice goalkeeper for the german national team since the tail end of 1996 winning 74 caps while lehmann has just 19 .
but the arsenal goalkeeper dreams of lifting the world cup crown in germany and insists it is not too much to expect despite the disastrous first round exit at euro 2004 . " france are going through a transitional phase , " he explained .

dw-world looks at how many of the big players see the issue . if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in late 2005 , bringing to head years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
but the issue of turkish membership in the eu has been hotly debated both in brussels and in the member states .
here 's a look at what some of the key players in the debate have to say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan , left , and chancellor schröder germany - chancellor gerhard schröder 's government is one of the most vocal proponents of welcoming turkey into the bloc .
with one eye on germany 's 2.5 million turks , the coalition of social democrats and greens back voting for membership talks at the december summit .
just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. peacekeepers walk along the barbed wires and barrels that mark the " green line " which separates turkish and greek cypriot communities greece - conservative prime minister costas karamanlis is a strong supporter of turkey 's bid , continuing the rapprochement policy of his socialist predecessor , costas simitis .
karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .
spain and sweden as well as new members poland and latvia have also indicated that ankara could expect their support when the final decision is taken in december .

just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .

the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off negotiations at opel continue opinion : blame the managers , not the country business -pipe- 06.10.2004 germany 's crippled city centers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if big downtown stores go under , so could their smaller neighbors germany 's largest department store chain , karstadt , has announced it might close 77 of its stores , primarily in smaller cities and towns .
some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country . " we started seeing town centers begin emptying out in the mid 1990s , " beate glöckner of the irs institute for regional development and structural planning told dw-world .
" the trend has begun to accelerate . " now city planners and demographers fear that the karstadt closings could mean that vicious circle is about spread to even more municipalities . " it can be the beginning of the decay of a town 's infrastructure , " reiner klingholz , director of the berlin institute for world population and global development , told dw-world .
" certain shops close , windows are shuttered , and this makes the place unattractive , not just for shoppers and existing businesses , but for new businesses as well . " the karstadt store in the bavarian town of deggendorf is one of the outlets threatened with closure .
while the news has the store 's 120 employees worried about their careers , it also has surrounding businesses fearing for their own futures . " it 's terrible , " sait ögütmen , owner of a snack bar next to the department store , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" the whole square here will deteriorate . " the " wal-mart " effect in fact , more and more often in germany , new businesses are avoiding town centers and choosing to set up shop in the open countryside on the outskirts of town .
already , only around a third of retail establishments in germany are in town centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart stores in the united states do a booming business it 's a similar phenomenon to the wal-mart story in the united states .
now the world 's largest store chain , wal-mart embarked on a massive expansion course in the 1990s , setting up its warehouse-like stores in former farm fields , where it could offer customers plenty of free parking and a huge selection of merchandise , often at rock-bottom prices . the result , however , was that smaller mom-and-pop stores up and down main street in small-town america could not compete and were forced out of business .
today , many stores in traditional small town centers are boarded up while the real centers of retail activity have shifted to the conglomerations outside the town limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea store in germany germany is seeing a similar development and the success stories on the german retail landscape , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , electronics superstore mediamarkt or the booming home improvement stores are enthusiastically following the new concept . " they 've developed whole shopping centers , offering acres of parking and a conglomeration of stores close to one another , " blanek said .
" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .
" there are other possibilities they can use to bring shoppers back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medieval town centers , like this one in trier in western germany , offer a unique shopping experience he suggests that stores in town centers cooperate on several levels , such as harmonizing their opening hours , establishing special incentives for shoppers to come downtown , or redesigning their shopping areas to take advantage of the unique historical character of the area . " town centers have things to offer consumers that the big superstores centers out of town can not , " he said .
" the shopping experience is , you might say , more authentic .
people like that .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures found near srebrenica these actions , in 1992 and 1993 , are seen by some as having played a role in fueling anti-muslim sentiment in the srebrenica enclave before the infamous massacre in july 1995 , the worst case of genocide in europe since world war ii .
pillaging of villages oric also faces charges related to the destruction of villages around srebrenica .
during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .

during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
eu officials have also not given a concrete date for turkey 's actual entry .
most estimates , though , indicate that ankara 's road to brussels will extend until well into the next decade , with 15 years the most likely target .
bumpy road to membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's been looking to join the eu for 40 years turkey , an official candidate since 1999 , has been waiting to join the european club for four decades .
but within the european bloc , turkish membership has been a controversial topic , with opinion divided on whether to accept a large , poor and predominantly muslim nation of 70 million with a patchy record on human rights .
" there is clearly the possibility that turkey can become a member , but the negotiations , and this is very important , are open-ended , " agriculture commissioner franz fischler said after the commission made its announcement .
" there is no more ground to be opposed fundamentally to the start of entry talks .
it is also clear that there is still a lot to do , " said fischler ahead of an official statement read in the european parliament .
the report noted ankara had made substantial progress in passing political reforms but still needed to improve implementation , notably in the fight against torture and the protection of fundamental liberties such as the freedom of expression and religion , and rights for women , trade unions and minorities .
" the commission will recommend the suspension of the negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the union is based , " it stated .
an emergency brake turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who was instrumental in pushing through policy reforms to bring his country in line with eu criteria for accession talks , voiced dismay at hints there would be an " emergency brake . "
prior to wednesday 's announcement he told deutsche welle that turkey had " done its homework " and it was now " up to the eu to uphold their end " and proceed with negotiations .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday also rejected any suggestion of " special conditions " for turkey and said the same criteria should apply to his country as to the 10 mostly eastern and southern european members who entered the bloc this past may .
european commission president romano prodi , speaking to reuters on the eve of his outgoing executive 's last major decision , played down the novelty of introducing an " emergency brake " to stop talks if ankara slipped on key standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani prodi , european commission president " we have to be sure that turkey will be like any of the other member states in case they come in , " he said , insisting the commission would apply the same standards to ankara 's bid as it did to all previous applicants .
" do n't you think there were clearly built-in emergency brakes in all the negotiations we had ? " he said .
special conditions for turkey in its report the commission also recommended the eu consider implementing permanent safeguards that would curb migrant labor from turkey , as well as agree to " specific arrangements " before ankara benefits fully from eu farm subsidies and regional aid .
an impact study leaked to the press ahead of the commission 's announcement revealed that between 500,000 and four million turkish migrants a year could move into the rest of the eu after membership , and that yearly subsidies of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- would be required to bring turkey 's agriculture and infrastructure up to par with the rest of the bloc .
despite these concerns , prodi said europe had no reason to fear turkey 's membership : " europe with a constitution , with strong institutions and affirmed policies for a strong model of peace and economic well being , has nothing to fear from the accession of turkey , " he told the european parliament . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth while turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan and the rest of turkey wait to hear from europe 's leaders , dw-world takes a look at the issues that effect the country 's connection to europe .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .
anyone who earns more than that can opt out .
this opt-out option presents a twofold risk , lauterbach said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with insurance , healthcare clients still have to shell out a copayment " on the one hand the groups engaged by the state to provide insurance lose premiums , " he said .
" on the other hand , the costs of illness have gotten so high that no one can afford to pay them alone . "
even people who earn very high salaries are effected when they opt out of insurance altogether , he said .
mess in the us lauterbach cited the united states as an example of the risks both individuals and society can take when health care is privatized .
some 120 million us citizens - 40 percent of the population - are either uninsured or underinsured .
of these , 44 million have no insurance protection whatsoever , while the rest are only partly insured .
" many us citizens ca n't afford adequate insurance and thus do n't get insurance for illnesses they may already have , " lauterbach said .
another case in point is the young , healthy americans who are in the middle of building up companies and families .
" they often have to opt to be uninsured purely on the basis of cost , " lauterbach said . " then if they get sick , it can lead to them losing their business .

" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .

protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .

the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .
those reforms included abolishing the death penalty , eliminating state security courts , adopting a " zero-tolerance policy " toward torture and reigning in the power of the military , which has seized power in turkey several times in recent decades , " in conformity with democratic norms , " he said .
he also said turkey will join the international criminal court .
" we hope to bring a long-traveled road to its final lap with the initiation of accession negotiations in the first half of 2005 , " he told the parliamentary committee of the council of europe , a group formed in 1949 to promote human rights and democracy in europe , but with no formal link to the eu .

" turkish membership will not be achieved overnight , " he said but added that his government expects to " conclude this phase within a reasonable amount of time . "
a decade or more while the eu 's head office formally recommended in a report on wednesday that talks begin with turkey , eu heads of state will make the final decision at their dec .

but even if the decision is favorable to turkey soon , officials have suggested negotiations could last a decade or more .
president jacques chirac of france , who is hanoi , vietnam where he will attend an asia-europe summit , said the process was only at the very beginning .
" if the european commission decides in december to open those negotiations , everybody is aware that these negotiations could last at the minimum between 10 and 15 years , " he told reporters .

" we expect to be subject to the same rules and conditions as other candidates , " he said .
german reaction in germany , opinion was split on the recommendation by the european commission that accession talks begin .
chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a visit to india , said he welcomed the recommendation by the commission and that germany would vote yes at the december meeting .
foreign minister joschka fischer was also positive about the commission 's report , saying the time frame of 10 to 15 years until actual membership was realistic .
however , conservative leader angela merkel of the christian democrats , was less enthusiastic , saying her party prefers offering turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .
germany industry and trade associations hailed the progress toward membership talks as a positive development .
according to the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the german economy could benefit from turkey 's membership , especially since turkey is a growth economy with strong strategic potential for german firms .

" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .
" there are other possibilities they can use to bring shoppers back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medieval town centers , like this one in trier in western germany , offer a unique shopping experience he suggests that stores in town centers cooperate on several levels , such as harmonizing their opening hours , establishing special incentives for shoppers to come downtown , or redesigning their shopping areas to take advantage of the unique historical character of the area . " town centers have things to offer consumers that the big superstores centers out of town can not , " he said .
" the shopping experience is , you might say , more authentic .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .
anyone who earns more than that can opt out .
this opt-out option presents a twofold risk , lauterbach said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with insurance , healthcare clients still have to shell out a copayment " on the one hand the groups engaged by the state to provide insurance lose premiums , " he said .
" on the other hand , the costs of illness have gotten so high that no one can afford to pay them alone . "
even people who earn very high salaries are effected when they opt out of insurance altogether , he said .
mess in the us lauterbach cited the united states as an example of the risks both individuals and society can take when health care is privatized .
some 120 million us citizens - 40 percent of the population - are either uninsured or underinsured .
of these , 44 million have no insurance protection whatsoever , while the rest are only partly insured .
" many us citizens ca n't afford adequate insurance and thus do n't get insurance for illnesses they may already have , " lauterbach said .
another case in point is the young , healthy americans who are in the middle of building up companies and families .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .
anyone who earns more than that can opt out .
this opt-out option presents a twofold risk , lauterbach said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with insurance , healthcare clients still have to shell out a copayment " on the one hand the groups engaged by the state to provide insurance lose premiums , " he said .
" on the other hand , the costs of illness have gotten so high that no one can afford to pay them alone . "
even people who earn very high salaries are effected when they opt out of insurance altogether , he said .
mess in the us lauterbach cited the united states as an example of the risks both individuals and society can take when health care is privatized .
some 120 million us citizens - 40 percent of the population - are either uninsured or underinsured .
of these , 44 million have no insurance protection whatsoever , while the rest are only partly insured .
" many us citizens ca n't afford adequate insurance and thus do n't get insurance for illnesses they may already have , " lauterbach said .
another case in point is the young , healthy americans who are in the middle of building up companies and families .
" they often have to opt to be uninsured purely on the basis of cost , " lauterbach said . " then if they get sick , it can lead to them losing their business .

with an eye on upcoming national elections , the party has recruited prominent neo-nazis for top leadership positions . germany 's far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which made headlines last month when it won 9.2 percent of the vote in regional elections in the eastern state of saxony , is pressing on with its efforts to enter the national government .
looking ahead to upcoming federal elections in 2006 , the npd has recruited two prominent neo-nazis for high-ranking leadership positions .
the move is part of a larger plan to create a " people 's front " from the right .
npd leader udo voigt is also scheduled to meet with gerhard frey , the leader of the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , another far right party that snagged 6.1 percent of the vote in brandenburg during the same regional elections , for talks focused on a possible alliance .

wulff directs the far-right scene in hamburg , and heise is active in thüringen .
their appointment could mobilize additional far-right voters and facilitate the ndp 's grab for power and influence at the national level - or so the ndp leadership hopes .
by pushing for alliances , the ndp is , in effect , serving as the unifier of germany 's previously somewhat fragmented far-right scene .
" the most important thing is to get into the federal parliament in 2006 , " said klaus beier , the ndp spokesman .
" in the future there will be no more working against one another . "
the npd claims that the far-right could win 7 percent of the vote in a national election , but analysts doubt that will happen .

the court decided to close the case on the grounds that several of the witnesses had ties to germany 's domestic intelligence agency .

with an eye on upcoming national elections , the party has recruited prominent neo-nazis for top leadership positions . germany 's far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which made headlines last month when it won 9.2 percent of the vote in regional elections in the eastern state of saxony , is pressing on with its efforts to enter the national government .
looking ahead to upcoming federal elections in 2006 , the npd has recruited two prominent neo-nazis for high-ranking leadership positions .
the move is part of a larger plan to create a " people 's front " from the right .
npd leader udo voigt is also scheduled to meet with gerhard frey , the leader of the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , another far right party that snagged 6.1 percent of the vote in brandenburg during the same regional elections , for talks focused on a possible alliance .
prominent neo-nazis join the ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd supporters demonstrated against banning the party in recruiting thomas wulff and thorsten heise onto the ndp 's board of directors - a move which will be officially announced at the party 's conference at the end of october - the ndp will gain two prominent members of the neo-nazi movement with a strong regional following and national profile .
wulff directs the far-right scene in hamburg , and heise is active in thüringen .
their appointment could mobilize additional far-right voters and facilitate the ndp 's grab for power and influence at the national level - or so the ndp leadership hopes .
by pushing for alliances , the ndp is , in effect , serving as the unifier of germany 's previously somewhat fragmented far-right scene .
" the most important thing is to get into the federal parliament in 2006 , " said klaus beier , the ndp spokesman .
" in the future there will be no more working against one another . "
the npd claims that the far-right could win 7 percent of the vote in a national election , but analysts doubt that will happen .
will the government move to ban the party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a demonstration in august last year , the german federal government failed in its effort to have the country 's highest court ban the ndp .
the court decided to close the case on the grounds that several of the witnesses had ties to germany 's domestic intelligence agency .
the government , however , was successful in foiling ndp plans to hold a massive demonstration in berlin with the xenophobic title " berlin stays german . "
though german interior minister otto schily has said that the government will not make a second attempt to ban the party , the addition of prominent neo-nazis to the party ranks and its attempt to repeat regional successes on the national stage could change that . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?
even though the results did n't come as a surprise , many germans were shocked at the success of extreme right-wing parties celebrating their success in two state elections .
german bloggerville also had something to say .
-lrb- september 23 , 2004 -rrb- german far-right aims for national alliance after scoring a big win in an eastern state poll last weekend , the neo-nazi national democratic party has said it aims to join forces with other far-right parties for the 2006 national election in germany .
-lrb- september 22 , 2004 -rrb- gains by extremist parties trouble germany germany woke up to fears that the political tremors sparked by state elections in saxony and brandenburg on sunday could lead to deeper division within their country and scare off investors .

the un high commissioner for refugees as well as the italian opposition have described the large-scale expulsions as " inhumane . "
italian television broadcast graphic images of hundreds of handcuffed refugees in lampedusa herded by policeman into waiting military planes .

berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa .

moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .

" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .

" there is clearly the possibility that turkey can become a member , but the negotiations , and this is very important , are open-ended , " agriculture commissioner franz fischler said after the commission made its announcement .
" there is no more ground to be opposed fundamentally to the start of entry talks .
it is also clear that there is still a lot to do , " said fischler ahead of an official statement read in the european parliament .
the report noted ankara had made substantial progress in passing political reforms but still needed to improve implementation , notably in the fight against torture and the protection of fundamental liberties such as the freedom of expression and religion , and rights for women , trade unions and minorities .
" the commission will recommend the suspension of the negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the union is based , " it stated .
an emergency brake turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who was instrumental in pushing through policy reforms to bring his country in line with eu criteria for accession talks , voiced dismay at hints there would be an " emergency brake . "
prior to wednesday 's announcement he told deutsche welle that turkey had " done its homework " and it was now " up to the eu to uphold their end " and proceed with negotiations .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday also rejected any suggestion of " special conditions " for turkey and said the same criteria should apply to his country as to the 10 mostly eastern and southern european members who entered the bloc this past may .
european commission president romano prodi , speaking to reuters on the eve of his outgoing executive 's last major decision , played down the novelty of introducing an " emergency brake " to stop talks if ankara slipped on key standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani prodi , european commission president " we have to be sure that turkey will be like any of the other member states in case they come in , " he said , insisting the commission would apply the same standards to ankara 's bid as it did to all previous applicants .

special conditions for turkey in its report the commission also recommended the eu consider implementing permanent safeguards that would curb migrant labor from turkey , as well as agree to " specific arrangements " before ankara benefits fully from eu farm subsidies and regional aid .

according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
eu officials have also not given a concrete date for turkey 's actual entry .
most estimates , though , indicate that ankara 's road to brussels will extend until well into the next decade , with 15 years the most likely target .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "

however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .

during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .

however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

dw-world looks at how many of the big players see the issue . if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in late 2005 , bringing to head years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
but the issue of turkish membership in the eu has been hotly debated both in brussels and in the member states .
here 's a look at what some of the key players in the debate have to say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan , left , and chancellor schröder germany - chancellor gerhard schröder 's government is one of the most vocal proponents of welcoming turkey into the bloc .
with one eye on germany 's 2.5 million turks , the coalition of social democrats and greens back voting for membership talks at the december summit .
just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. peacekeepers walk along the barbed wires and barrels that mark the " green line " which separates turkish and greek cypriot communities greece - conservative prime minister costas karamanlis is a strong supporter of turkey 's bid , continuing the rapprochement policy of his socialist predecessor , costas simitis .
karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .
spain and sweden as well as new members poland and latvia have also indicated that ankara could expect their support when the final decision is taken in december .

just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .

karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .
spain and sweden as well as new members poland and latvia have also indicated that ankara could expect their support when the final decision is taken in december .

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .
" what olli did was by no means ok , " raged bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we told olli that actions such as that endanger his reputation . "
even kahn 's goalkeeping coach and long-term friend , sepp maier , put the boot in .
" that was a stupid thing he did with klose , " maier told munich newspaper az .
" he should know that himself . "
bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .
kahn has a reputation for having a short fuse and he earned the unwanted nickname ' genghis kahn ' after a kung-fu kick attack on borussia dortmund 's stephane chapuisat in april 1999 .
but germany coach jürgen klinsmann was unaffacted by the incident claiming it was part and parcel of soccer .

" i do not think two international team-mates going for one another should be blown up , " said klinsmann .
" it is an emotional moment that can happen in the match .
that will also happen two months before the world cup . "
klose and kahn will avoid one another when germany face iran on saturday in tehran with klinsmann opting to rest kahn and hand a starting chance to arsenal 's jens lehmann .
eager lehmann earlier this week , lehmann said he would be in goal for germany for the 2006 world cup campaign leaving bayern munich 's oliver kahn warming the substitutes ' bench .
the former borussia dortmund custodian vowed to put kahn in the shade during his match against iran .
" i am convinced that i will be in goal for the 2006 world cup , " insisted lehmann in magazine kicker .
" i am at the peak of my career in terms of experience and sporting ability . "
bayern shot-stopper kahn was stripped of the captaincy by klinsmann , with michael ballack favored , and lehmann believes his chances are improved with kahn no longer guaranteed a place in the starting line-up .
" the captain has to play so a goalkeeper as captain is not the best idea , " added lehmann .
" for me it was awful to be in competition with someone who has a 40 percent advantage because he is captain . "
kahn has been first choice goalkeeper for the german national team since the tail end of 1996 winning 74 caps while lehmann has just 19 .
but the arsenal goalkeeper dreams of lifting the world cup crown in germany and insists it is not too much to expect despite the disastrous first round exit at euro 2004 . " france are going through a transitional phase , " he explained .
" england , the netherlands and italy are hardly world beaters , although brazil are a very strong team .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .
those reforms included abolishing the death penalty , eliminating state security courts , adopting a " zero-tolerance policy " toward torture and reigning in the power of the military , which has seized power in turkey several times in recent decades , " in conformity with democratic norms , " he said .
he also said turkey will join the international criminal court .
" we hope to bring a long-traveled road to its final lap with the initiation of accession negotiations in the first half of 2005 , " he told the parliamentary committee of the council of europe , a group formed in 1949 to promote human rights and democracy in europe , but with no formal link to the eu .

the healing power of storytelling culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.10.2004 frankfurt book fair opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations are underway for the start of the frankfurt book fair gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , opened the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .
chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .
bridging two worlds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the arab league will be this year 's special guests .
the organizers and their guests both expressed their hope that the book fair will help bring the arab and western worlds closer together at a time when conflict is rife .
more than 200 authors , artists and politicians from members of the arab league traveled to frankfurt , among them the palestinian mahmud darwish and moroccan tahar ben jelloun .
the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .
but , according to organizers , the presence of arab writers at this year 's book fair is not about increasing sales , but increasing understanding .
raising the profile of german-language writers in addition to the events highlighting the literature of arab countries , a new german book prize modeled on the pulitzer prize in the united states and the prix goncourt in france will be unveiled at this year 's event .
the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .
a jury of five literature experts will be responsible for selecting the winner , and the short list of the first five finalists will be released in september of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : open , sesame !
when the frankfurt book fair opens next week , the guest of honor will be the arab world .
the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in .
-lrb- october 2 , 2004 -rrb- book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all .

the healing power of storytelling culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.10.2004 frankfurt book fair opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations are underway for the start of the frankfurt book fair gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , opened the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .
chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .
bridging two worlds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the arab league will be this year 's special guests .
the organizers and their guests both expressed their hope that the book fair will help bring the arab and western worlds closer together at a time when conflict is rife .
more than 200 authors , artists and politicians from members of the arab league traveled to frankfurt , among them the palestinian mahmud darwish and moroccan tahar ben jelloun .
the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .
but , according to organizers , the presence of arab writers at this year 's book fair is not about increasing sales , but increasing understanding .
raising the profile of german-language writers in addition to the events highlighting the literature of arab countries , a new german book prize modeled on the pulitzer prize in the united states and the prix goncourt in france will be unveiled at this year 's event .
the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .
a jury of five literature experts will be responsible for selecting the winner , and the short list of the first five finalists will be released in september of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : open , sesame !
when the frankfurt book fair opens next week , the guest of honor will be the arab world .
the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in .

some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country . " we started seeing town centers begin emptying out in the mid 1990s , " beate glöckner of the irs institute for regional development and structural planning told dw-world .

" it can be the beginning of the decay of a town 's infrastructure , " reiner klingholz , director of the berlin institute for world population and global development , told dw-world .
" certain shops close , windows are shuttered , and this makes the place unattractive , not just for shoppers and existing businesses , but for new businesses as well . " the karstadt store in the bavarian town of deggendorf is one of the outlets threatened with closure .
while the news has the store 's 120 employees worried about their careers , it also has surrounding businesses fearing for their own futures . " it 's terrible , " sait ögütmen , owner of a snack bar next to the department store , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" the whole square here will deteriorate . " the " wal-mart " effect in fact , more and more often in germany , new businesses are avoiding town centers and choosing to set up shop in the open countryside on the outskirts of town .

the healing power of storytelling culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.10.2004 frankfurt book fair opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations are underway for the start of the frankfurt book fair gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , opened the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .
chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .
bridging two worlds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the arab league will be this year 's special guests .
the organizers and their guests both expressed their hope that the book fair will help bring the arab and western worlds closer together at a time when conflict is rife .
more than 200 authors , artists and politicians from members of the arab league traveled to frankfurt , among them the palestinian mahmud darwish and moroccan tahar ben jelloun .
the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .
but , according to organizers , the presence of arab writers at this year 's book fair is not about increasing sales , but increasing understanding .
raising the profile of german-language writers in addition to the events highlighting the literature of arab countries , a new german book prize modeled on the pulitzer prize in the united states and the prix goncourt in france will be unveiled at this year 's event .
the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .

the healing power of storytelling culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.10.2004 frankfurt book fair opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations are underway for the start of the frankfurt book fair gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , opened the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .
chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .
bridging two worlds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the arab league will be this year 's special guests .
the organizers and their guests both expressed their hope that the book fair will help bring the arab and western worlds closer together at a time when conflict is rife .
more than 200 authors , artists and politicians from members of the arab league traveled to frankfurt , among them the palestinian mahmud darwish and moroccan tahar ben jelloun .
the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .
but , according to organizers , the presence of arab writers at this year 's book fair is not about increasing sales , but increasing understanding .
raising the profile of german-language writers in addition to the events highlighting the literature of arab countries , a new german book prize modeled on the pulitzer prize in the united states and the prix goncourt in france will be unveiled at this year 's event .
the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .
a jury of five literature experts will be responsible for selecting the winner , and the short list of the first five finalists will be released in september of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : open , sesame !
when the frankfurt book fair opens next week , the guest of honor will be the arab world .
the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in .
-lrb- october 2 , 2004 -rrb- book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .
those reforms included abolishing the death penalty , eliminating state security courts , adopting a " zero-tolerance policy " toward torture and reigning in the power of the military , which has seized power in turkey several times in recent decades , " in conformity with democratic norms , " he said .
he also said turkey will join the international criminal court .
" we hope to bring a long-traveled road to its final lap with the initiation of accession negotiations in the first half of 2005 , " he told the parliamentary committee of the council of europe , a group formed in 1949 to promote human rights and democracy in europe , but with no formal link to the eu .

" turkish membership will not be achieved overnight , " he said but added that his government expects to " conclude this phase within a reasonable amount of time . "

" we expect to be subject to the same rules and conditions as other candidates , " he said .

chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a visit to india , said he welcomed the recommendation by the commission and that germany would vote yes at the december meeting .
foreign minister joschka fischer was also positive about the commission 's report , saying the time frame of 10 to 15 years until actual membership was realistic .
however , conservative leader angela merkel of the christian democrats , was less enthusiastic , saying her party prefers offering turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .
germany industry and trade associations hailed the progress toward membership talks as a positive development .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .
anyone who earns more than that can opt out .
this opt-out option presents a twofold risk , lauterbach said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with insurance , healthcare clients still have to shell out a copayment " on the one hand the groups engaged by the state to provide insurance lose premiums , " he said .
" on the other hand , the costs of illness have gotten so high that no one can afford to pay them alone . "
even people who earn very high salaries are effected when they opt out of insurance altogether , he said .
mess in the us lauterbach cited the united states as an example of the risks both individuals and society can take when health care is privatized .
some 120 million us citizens - 40 percent of the population - are either uninsured or underinsured .
of these , 44 million have no insurance protection whatsoever , while the rest are only partly insured .
" many us citizens ca n't afford adequate insurance and thus do n't get insurance for illnesses they may already have , " lauterbach said .
another case in point is the young , healthy americans who are in the middle of building up companies and families .
" they often have to opt to be uninsured purely on the basis of cost , " lauterbach said . " then if they get sick , it can lead to them losing their business .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures found near srebrenica these actions , in 1992 and 1993 , are seen by some as having played a role in fueling anti-muslim sentiment in the srebrenica enclave before the infamous massacre in july 1995 , the worst case of genocide in europe since world war ii .
pillaging of villages oric also faces charges related to the destruction of villages around srebrenica .
during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic before the tribunal in the hague some have speculated that oric 's trial could uncover more evidence against former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is currently facing war crimes charges in the hague .

with an eye on upcoming national elections , the party has recruited prominent neo-nazis for top leadership positions . germany 's far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which made headlines last month when it won 9.2 percent of the vote in regional elections in the eastern state of saxony , is pressing on with its efforts to enter the national government .
looking ahead to upcoming federal elections in 2006 , the npd has recruited two prominent neo-nazis for high-ranking leadership positions .
the move is part of a larger plan to create a " people 's front " from the right .
npd leader udo voigt is also scheduled to meet with gerhard frey , the leader of the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , another far right party that snagged 6.1 percent of the vote in brandenburg during the same regional elections , for talks focused on a possible alliance .

wulff directs the far-right scene in hamburg , and heise is active in thüringen .
their appointment could mobilize additional far-right voters and facilitate the ndp 's grab for power and influence at the national level - or so the ndp leadership hopes .
by pushing for alliances , the ndp is , in effect , serving as the unifier of germany 's previously somewhat fragmented far-right scene .
" the most important thing is to get into the federal parliament in 2006 , " said klaus beier , the ndp spokesman .
" in the future there will be no more working against one another . "
the npd claims that the far-right could win 7 percent of the vote in a national election , but analysts doubt that will happen .
will the government move to ban the party ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis at a demonstration in august last year , the german federal government failed in its effort to have the country 's highest court ban the ndp .
the court decided to close the case on the grounds that several of the witnesses had ties to germany 's domestic intelligence agency .
the government , however , was successful in foiling ndp plans to hold a massive demonstration in berlin with the xenophobic title " berlin stays german . "
though german interior minister otto schily has said that the government will not make a second attempt to ban the party , the addition of prominent neo-nazis to the party ranks and its attempt to repeat regional successes on the national stage could change that . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey " a change in mentality is needed " waiting for eu capturing turkish culture 's changing face europe -pipe- 06.10.2004 turkey membership splits eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all the member states are in favor of turkey in the eu now that the european commission has given its nod to ankara , eu leaders are set to make a final decision on starting accession talks at a december summit .
dw-world looks at how many of the big players see the issue . if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in late 2005 , bringing to head years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
but the issue of turkish membership in the eu has been hotly debated both in brussels and in the member states .
here 's a look at what some of the key players in the debate have to say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan , left , and chancellor schröder germany - chancellor gerhard schröder 's government is one of the most vocal proponents of welcoming turkey into the bloc .
with one eye on germany 's 2.5 million turks , the coalition of social democrats and greens back voting for membership talks at the december summit .
just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. peacekeepers walk along the barbed wires and barrels that mark the " green line " which separates turkish and greek cypriot communities greece - conservative prime minister costas karamanlis is a strong supporter of turkey 's bid , continuing the rapprochement policy of his socialist predecessor , costas simitis .
karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .
" what olli did was by no means ok , " raged bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we told olli that actions such as that endanger his reputation . "
even kahn 's goalkeeping coach and long-term friend , sepp maier , put the boot in .
" that was a stupid thing he did with klose , " maier told munich newspaper az .
" he should know that himself . "
bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .
kahn has a reputation for having a short fuse and he earned the unwanted nickname ' genghis kahn ' after a kung-fu kick attack on borussia dortmund 's stephane chapuisat in april 1999 .
but germany coach jürgen klinsmann was unaffacted by the incident claiming it was part and parcel of soccer .

" i do not think two international team-mates going for one another should be blown up , " said klinsmann .
" it is an emotional moment that can happen in the match .
that will also happen two months before the world cup . "
klose and kahn will avoid one another when germany face iran on saturday in tehran with klinsmann opting to rest kahn and hand a starting chance to arsenal 's jens lehmann .
eager lehmann earlier this week , lehmann said he would be in goal for germany for the 2006 world cup campaign leaving bayern munich 's oliver kahn warming the substitutes ' bench .
the former borussia dortmund custodian vowed to put kahn in the shade during his match against iran .
" i am convinced that i will be in goal for the 2006 world cup , " insisted lehmann in magazine kicker .
" i am at the peak of my career in terms of experience and sporting ability . "
bayern shot-stopper kahn was stripped of the captaincy by klinsmann , with michael ballack favored , and lehmann believes his chances are improved with kahn no longer guaranteed a place in the starting line-up .
" the captain has to play so a goalkeeper as captain is not the best idea , " added lehmann .
" for me it was awful to be in competition with someone who has a 40 percent advantage because he is captain . "
kahn has been first choice goalkeeper for the german national team since the tail end of 1996 winning 74 caps while lehmann has just 19 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's eu moment of truth verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey " a change in mentality is needed " waiting for eu capturing turkish culture 's changing face europe -pipe- 06.10.2004 turkey gets green light from brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's erdogan gets the eu commission 's blessing the european commission has approved starting eu accession negotiations with turkey .
according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
eu officials have also not given a concrete date for turkey 's actual entry .
most estimates , though , indicate that ankara 's road to brussels will extend until well into the next decade , with 15 years the most likely target .
bumpy road to membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's been looking to join the eu for 40 years turkey , an official candidate since 1999 , has been waiting to join the european club for four decades .
but within the european bloc , turkish membership has been a controversial topic , with opinion divided on whether to accept a large , poor and predominantly muslim nation of 70 million with a patchy record on human rights .
" there is clearly the possibility that turkey can become a member , but the negotiations , and this is very important , are open-ended , " agriculture commissioner franz fischler said after the commission made its announcement .
" there is no more ground to be opposed fundamentally to the start of entry talks .
it is also clear that there is still a lot to do , " said fischler ahead of an official statement read in the european parliament .
the report noted ankara had made substantial progress in passing political reforms but still needed to improve implementation , notably in the fight against torture and the protection of fundamental liberties such as the freedom of expression and religion , and rights for women , trade unions and minorities .
" the commission will recommend the suspension of the negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the union is based , " it stated .
an emergency brake turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who was instrumental in pushing through policy reforms to bring his country in line with eu criteria for accession talks , voiced dismay at hints there would be an " emergency brake . "
prior to wednesday 's announcement he told deutsche welle that turkey had " done its homework " and it was now " up to the eu to uphold their end " and proceed with negotiations .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday also rejected any suggestion of " special conditions " for turkey and said the same criteria should apply to his country as to the 10 mostly eastern and southern european members who entered the bloc this past may .
european commission president romano prodi , speaking to reuters on the eve of his outgoing executive 's last major decision , played down the novelty of introducing an " emergency brake " to stop talks if ankara slipped on key standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani prodi , european commission president " we have to be sure that turkey will be like any of the other member states in case they come in , " he said , insisting the commission would apply the same standards to ankara 's bid as it did to all previous applicants .
" do n't you think there were clearly built-in emergency brakes in all the negotiations we had ? " he said .
special conditions for turkey in its report the commission also recommended the eu consider implementing permanent safeguards that would curb migrant labor from turkey , as well as agree to " specific arrangements " before ankara benefits fully from eu farm subsidies and regional aid .
an impact study leaked to the press ahead of the commission 's announcement revealed that between 500,000 and four million turkish migrants a year could move into the rest of the eu after membership , and that yearly subsidies of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- would be required to bring turkey 's agriculture and infrastructure up to par with the rest of the bloc .
despite these concerns , prodi said europe had no reason to fear turkey 's membership : " europe with a constitution , with strong institutions and affirmed policies for a strong model of peace and economic well being , has nothing to fear from the accession of turkey , " he told the european parliament . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth while turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan and the rest of turkey wait to hear from europe 's leaders , dw-world takes a look at the issues that effect the country 's connection to europe .
erdogan : " we have done our homework " this week , the european commission will publish a report expected to give turkey the go ahead to start accession talks .
in an interview with deutsche welle , the turkish premier was convinced this would take place .

the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .
three other military transport planes were standing by to take a further 300 deportees back to libya during the afternoon . " inhumane " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants appear from the german cap anamur aid ship as they dock in the sicilian harbour of porto empedocle , italy in july .
the un high commissioner for refugees as well as the italian opposition have described the large-scale expulsions as " inhumane . "
italian television broadcast graphic images of hundreds of handcuffed refugees in lampedusa herded by policeman into waiting military planes . " the immigrants have been treated without the slightest respect for international conventions , " pietro folena , parliamentarian and member of italy 's largest opposition party , democrats of the left -lrb- ds -rrb- told afp .
" italy 's reputation has been besmirched by an offense against human rights , " folena added . amnesty international and doctors without borders also slammed the deportation , saying it was a " grave violation " of national and international asylum laws . italian stance on refugees laura boldrini , unhcr spokeswoman said that the speeded up deportation process of refugees from lampedusa was shrouded in secrecy . boldrini said the italian authorities made no effort to differentiate between asylum-seeking candidates and economic refugees .
she also pointed out that the authorities did n't even possess equipment for carrying out identification measures such as fingerprints or photographs of the refugees . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu was quoted as saying , " the poor devils -lrb- the refugees -rrb- must know that they will get humanitarian help , but then will be sent back immediately to the place where they came from . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhausted african refugees lie in a boot near the italian island of lampedusa in oct .
2003 .
but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .
thus , italy sends rejected refugees after a perfunctory check , back to a country where the basic standards of refugee rights are n't guaranteed , experts complain . in brussels on tuesday , italy 's nominee to become the european union 's justice and home affairs commissioner , rocco buttiglione said he was not aware of any violations .
" if this information is wrong , i 'll be the first one to denounce the situation , " buttiglione told the apcom news agency . unhcr waiting for access to refugees meanwhile on wednesday , the unhcr complained that italian authorities have not yet given the un agency clearance to the around 500 refugees who are still believed to be in lampedusa . " we are concerned because among the people who have been sent back , there were some who would perhaps have had the right to lodge a request for political asylum , " juergen humburg of the unhcr told afp . over the last two days alone , over a thousand would-be immigrants are said to have landed on italy 's southern coast .
one of the boats carrying the immigrants capsized off the coast of tunisia on monday , killing at least 22 people . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will have a chance to discuss the issue with libyan officials during a short visit on thursday .
berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa . " spain is not favorable to this kind of initiative , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said tuesday .
moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .
the plan is to be discussed at a meeting of eu interior ministers later this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

dw-world looks at how many of the big players see the issue . if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in late 2005 , bringing to head years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
but the issue of turkish membership in the eu has been hotly debated both in brussels and in the member states .
here 's a look at what some of the key players in the debate have to say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan , left , and chancellor schröder germany - chancellor gerhard schröder 's government is one of the most vocal proponents of welcoming turkey into the bloc .
with one eye on germany 's 2.5 million turks , the coalition of social democrats and greens back voting for membership talks at the december summit .
just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. peacekeepers walk along the barbed wires and barrels that mark the " green line " which separates turkish and greek cypriot communities greece - conservative prime minister costas karamanlis is a strong supporter of turkey 's bid , continuing the rapprochement policy of his socialist predecessor , costas simitis .
karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .
spain and sweden as well as new members poland and latvia have also indicated that ankara could expect their support when the final decision is taken in december .

greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .
spain and sweden as well as new members poland and latvia have also indicated that ankara could expect their support when the final decision is taken in december .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , however , has urged caution . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth dw-world looks at the transformation of turkey on its road to brussels and the intense debate surrounding membership .

the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .
three other military transport planes were standing by to take a further 300 deportees back to libya during the afternoon .

but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .

berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa . " spain is not favorable to this kind of initiative , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said tuesday .
moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .

bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .
kahn has a reputation for having a short fuse and he earned the unwanted nickname ' genghis kahn ' after a kung-fu kick attack on borussia dortmund 's stephane chapuisat in april 1999 .

" i am convinced that i will be in goal for the 2006 world cup , " insisted lehmann in magazine kicker .
" i am at the peak of my career in terms of experience and sporting ability . "
bayern shot-stopper kahn was stripped of the captaincy by klinsmann , with michael ballack favored , and lehmann believes his chances are improved with kahn no longer guaranteed a place in the starting line-up .
" the captain has to play so a goalkeeper as captain is not the best idea , " added lehmann .

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .
" what olli did was by no means ok , " raged bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we told olli that actions such as that endanger his reputation . "
even kahn 's goalkeeping coach and long-term friend , sepp maier , put the boot in .
" that was a stupid thing he did with klose , " maier told munich newspaper az .
" he should know that himself . "
bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .
kahn has a reputation for having a short fuse and he earned the unwanted nickname ' genghis kahn ' after a kung-fu kick attack on borussia dortmund 's stephane chapuisat in april 1999 .
but germany coach jürgen klinsmann was unaffacted by the incident claiming it was part and parcel of soccer .

" i do not think two international team-mates going for one another should be blown up , " said klinsmann .
" it is an emotional moment that can happen in the match .
that will also happen two months before the world cup . "
klose and kahn will avoid one another when germany face iran on saturday in tehran with klinsmann opting to rest kahn and hand a starting chance to arsenal 's jens lehmann .
eager lehmann earlier this week , lehmann said he would be in goal for germany for the 2006 world cup campaign leaving bayern munich 's oliver kahn warming the substitutes ' bench .
the former borussia dortmund custodian vowed to put kahn in the shade during his match against iran .
" i am convinced that i will be in goal for the 2006 world cup , " insisted lehmann in magazine kicker .
" i am at the peak of my career in terms of experience and sporting ability . "
bayern shot-stopper kahn was stripped of the captaincy by klinsmann , with michael ballack favored , and lehmann believes his chances are improved with kahn no longer guaranteed a place in the starting line-up .
" the captain has to play so a goalkeeper as captain is not the best idea , " added lehmann .
" for me it was awful to be in competition with someone who has a 40 percent advantage because he is captain . "
kahn has been first choice goalkeeper for the german national team since the tail end of 1996 winning 74 caps while lehmann has just 19 .
but the arsenal goalkeeper dreams of lifting the world cup crown in germany and insists it is not too much to expect despite the disastrous first round exit at euro 2004 . " france are going through a transitional phase , " he explained .
" england , the netherlands and italy are hardly world beaters , although brazil are a very strong team .

according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
eu officials have also not given a concrete date for turkey 's actual entry .
most estimates , though , indicate that ankara 's road to brussels will extend until well into the next decade , with 15 years the most likely target .
bumpy road to membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's been looking to join the eu for 40 years turkey , an official candidate since 1999 , has been waiting to join the european club for four decades .
but within the european bloc , turkish membership has been a controversial topic , with opinion divided on whether to accept a large , poor and predominantly muslim nation of 70 million with a patchy record on human rights .
" there is clearly the possibility that turkey can become a member , but the negotiations , and this is very important , are open-ended , " agriculture commissioner franz fischler said after the commission made its announcement .
" there is no more ground to be opposed fundamentally to the start of entry talks .
it is also clear that there is still a lot to do , " said fischler ahead of an official statement read in the european parliament .
the report noted ankara had made substantial progress in passing political reforms but still needed to improve implementation , notably in the fight against torture and the protection of fundamental liberties such as the freedom of expression and religion , and rights for women , trade unions and minorities .
" the commission will recommend the suspension of the negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the union is based , " it stated .
an emergency brake turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who was instrumental in pushing through policy reforms to bring his country in line with eu criteria for accession talks , voiced dismay at hints there would be an " emergency brake . "
prior to wednesday 's announcement he told deutsche welle that turkey had " done its homework " and it was now " up to the eu to uphold their end " and proceed with negotiations .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday also rejected any suggestion of " special conditions " for turkey and said the same criteria should apply to his country as to the 10 mostly eastern and southern european members who entered the bloc this past may .
european commission president romano prodi , speaking to reuters on the eve of his outgoing executive 's last major decision , played down the novelty of introducing an " emergency brake " to stop talks if ankara slipped on key standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani prodi , european commission president " we have to be sure that turkey will be like any of the other member states in case they come in , " he said , insisting the commission would apply the same standards to ankara 's bid as it did to all previous applicants .
" do n't you think there were clearly built-in emergency brakes in all the negotiations we had ? " he said .
special conditions for turkey in its report the commission also recommended the eu consider implementing permanent safeguards that would curb migrant labor from turkey , as well as agree to " specific arrangements " before ankara benefits fully from eu farm subsidies and regional aid .
an impact study leaked to the press ahead of the commission 's announcement revealed that between 500,000 and four million turkish migrants a year could move into the rest of the eu after membership , and that yearly subsidies of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- would be required to bring turkey 's agriculture and infrastructure up to par with the rest of the bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off negotiations at opel continue opinion : blame the managers , not the country business -pipe- 06.10.2004 germany 's crippled city centers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if big downtown stores go under , so could their smaller neighbors germany 's largest department store chain , karstadt , has announced it might close 77 of its stores , primarily in smaller cities and towns .
some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country . " we started seeing town centers begin emptying out in the mid 1990s , " beate glöckner of the irs institute for regional development and structural planning told dw-world .
" the trend has begun to accelerate . " now city planners and demographers fear that the karstadt closings could mean that vicious circle is about spread to even more municipalities . " it can be the beginning of the decay of a town 's infrastructure , " reiner klingholz , director of the berlin institute for world population and global development , told dw-world .
" certain shops close , windows are shuttered , and this makes the place unattractive , not just for shoppers and existing businesses , but for new businesses as well . " the karstadt store in the bavarian town of deggendorf is one of the outlets threatened with closure .
while the news has the store 's 120 employees worried about their careers , it also has surrounding businesses fearing for their own futures . " it 's terrible , " sait ögütmen , owner of a snack bar next to the department store , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" the whole square here will deteriorate . " the " wal-mart " effect in fact , more and more often in germany , new businesses are avoiding town centers and choosing to set up shop in the open countryside on the outskirts of town .
already , only around a third of retail establishments in germany are in town centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart stores in the united states do a booming business it 's a similar phenomenon to the wal-mart story in the united states .
now the world 's largest store chain , wal-mart embarked on a massive expansion course in the 1990s , setting up its warehouse-like stores in former farm fields , where it could offer customers plenty of free parking and a huge selection of merchandise , often at rock-bottom prices . the result , however , was that smaller mom-and-pop stores up and down main street in small-town america could not compete and were forced out of business .
today , many stores in traditional small town centers are boarded up while the real centers of retail activity have shifted to the conglomerations outside the town limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea store in germany germany is seeing a similar development and the success stories on the german retail landscape , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , electronics superstore mediamarkt or the booming home improvement stores are enthusiastically following the new concept . " they 've developed whole shopping centers , offering acres of parking and a conglomeration of stores close to one another , " blanek said .
" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .
" there are other possibilities they can use to bring shoppers back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medieval town centers , like this one in trier in western germany , offer a unique shopping experience he suggests that stores in town centers cooperate on several levels , such as harmonizing their opening hours , establishing special incentives for shoppers to come downtown , or redesigning their shopping areas to take advantage of the unique historical character of the area . " town centers have things to offer consumers that the big superstores centers out of town can not , " he said .
" the shopping experience is , you might say , more authentic .

some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country . " we started seeing town centers begin emptying out in the mid 1990s , " beate glöckner of the irs institute for regional development and structural planning told dw-world .
" the trend has begun to accelerate . " now city planners and demographers fear that the karstadt closings could mean that vicious circle is about spread to even more municipalities . " it can be the beginning of the decay of a town 's infrastructure , " reiner klingholz , director of the berlin institute for world population and global development , told dw-world .
" certain shops close , windows are shuttered , and this makes the place unattractive , not just for shoppers and existing businesses , but for new businesses as well . " the karstadt store in the bavarian town of deggendorf is one of the outlets threatened with closure .
while the news has the store 's 120 employees worried about their careers , it also has surrounding businesses fearing for their own futures . " it 's terrible , " sait ögütmen , owner of a snack bar next to the department store , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" the whole square here will deteriorate . " the " wal-mart " effect in fact , more and more often in germany , new businesses are avoiding town centers and choosing to set up shop in the open countryside on the outskirts of town .
already , only around a third of retail establishments in germany are in town centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart stores in the united states do a booming business it 's a similar phenomenon to the wal-mart story in the united states .
now the world 's largest store chain , wal-mart embarked on a massive expansion course in the 1990s , setting up its warehouse-like stores in former farm fields , where it could offer customers plenty of free parking and a huge selection of merchandise , often at rock-bottom prices . the result , however , was that smaller mom-and-pop stores up and down main street in small-town america could not compete and were forced out of business .
today , many stores in traditional small town centers are boarded up while the real centers of retail activity have shifted to the conglomerations outside the town limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea store in germany germany is seeing a similar development and the success stories on the german retail landscape , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , electronics superstore mediamarkt or the booming home improvement stores are enthusiastically following the new concept . " they 've developed whole shopping centers , offering acres of parking and a conglomeration of stores close to one another , " blanek said .
" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures found near srebrenica these actions , in 1992 and 1993 , are seen by some as having played a role in fueling anti-muslim sentiment in the srebrenica enclave before the infamous massacre in july 1995 , the worst case of genocide in europe since world war ii .
pillaging of villages oric also faces charges related to the destruction of villages around srebrenica .
during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

dw-world looks at how many of the big players see the issue . if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in late 2005 , bringing to head years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
but the issue of turkish membership in the eu has been hotly debated both in brussels and in the member states .
here 's a look at what some of the key players in the debate have to say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan , left , and chancellor schröder germany - chancellor gerhard schröder 's government is one of the most vocal proponents of welcoming turkey into the bloc .
with one eye on germany 's 2.5 million turks , the coalition of social democrats and greens back voting for membership talks at the december summit .
just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. peacekeepers walk along the barbed wires and barrels that mark the " green line " which separates turkish and greek cypriot communities greece - conservative prime minister costas karamanlis is a strong supporter of turkey 's bid , continuing the rapprochement policy of his socialist predecessor , costas simitis .
karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .
spain and sweden as well as new members poland and latvia have also indicated that ankara could expect their support when the final decision is taken in december .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , however , has urged caution . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth dw-world looks at the transformation of turkey on its road to brussels and the intense debate surrounding membership .

the healing power of storytelling culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.10.2004 frankfurt book fair opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations are underway for the start of the frankfurt book fair gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , opened the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .
chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .
bridging two worlds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the arab league will be this year 's special guests .
the organizers and their guests both expressed their hope that the book fair will help bring the arab and western worlds closer together at a time when conflict is rife .
more than 200 authors , artists and politicians from members of the arab league traveled to frankfurt , among them the palestinian mahmud darwish and moroccan tahar ben jelloun .
the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .
but , according to organizers , the presence of arab writers at this year 's book fair is not about increasing sales , but increasing understanding .
raising the profile of german-language writers in addition to the events highlighting the literature of arab countries , a new german book prize modeled on the pulitzer prize in the united states and the prix goncourt in france will be unveiled at this year 's event .
the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .
a jury of five literature experts will be responsible for selecting the winner , and the short list of the first five finalists will be released in september of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : open , sesame !

the healing power of storytelling culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.10.2004 frankfurt book fair opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations are underway for the start of the frankfurt book fair gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , opened the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .
chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .
those reforms included abolishing the death penalty , eliminating state security courts , adopting a " zero-tolerance policy " toward torture and reigning in the power of the military , which has seized power in turkey several times in recent decades , " in conformity with democratic norms , " he said .
he also said turkey will join the international criminal court .
" we hope to bring a long-traveled road to its final lap with the initiation of accession negotiations in the first half of 2005 , " he told the parliamentary committee of the council of europe , a group formed in 1949 to promote human rights and democracy in europe , but with no formal link to the eu .

some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures found near srebrenica these actions , in 1992 and 1993 , are seen by some as having played a role in fueling anti-muslim sentiment in the srebrenica enclave before the infamous massacre in july 1995 , the worst case of genocide in europe since world war ii .
pillaging of villages oric also faces charges related to the destruction of villages around srebrenica .
during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .
new light on milosevic ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic before the tribunal in the hague some have speculated that oric 's trial could uncover more evidence against former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is currently facing war crimes charges in the hague .
but jim landsdale , a spokesman for the tribunal , said oric 's trial should not be considered a proxy for milosevic 's .
" -lsb- the trial -rsb- is focusing on specific charges against one individual , and that will be the focus of this trial , " he said .

the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .
three other military transport planes were standing by to take a further 300 deportees back to libya during the afternoon . " inhumane " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants appear from the german cap anamur aid ship as they dock in the sicilian harbour of porto empedocle , italy in july .
the un high commissioner for refugees as well as the italian opposition have described the large-scale expulsions as " inhumane . "
italian television broadcast graphic images of hundreds of handcuffed refugees in lampedusa herded by policeman into waiting military planes . " the immigrants have been treated without the slightest respect for international conventions , " pietro folena , parliamentarian and member of italy 's largest opposition party , democrats of the left -lrb- ds -rrb- told afp .
" italy 's reputation has been besmirched by an offense against human rights , " folena added . amnesty international and doctors without borders also slammed the deportation , saying it was a " grave violation " of national and international asylum laws . italian stance on refugees laura boldrini , unhcr spokeswoman said that the speeded up deportation process of refugees from lampedusa was shrouded in secrecy . boldrini said the italian authorities made no effort to differentiate between asylum-seeking candidates and economic refugees .
she also pointed out that the authorities did n't even possess equipment for carrying out identification measures such as fingerprints or photographs of the refugees . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu was quoted as saying , " the poor devils -lrb- the refugees -rrb- must know that they will get humanitarian help , but then will be sent back immediately to the place where they came from . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhausted african refugees lie in a boot near the italian island of lampedusa in oct .
2003 .
but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .
thus , italy sends rejected refugees after a perfunctory check , back to a country where the basic standards of refugee rights are n't guaranteed , experts complain . in brussels on tuesday , italy 's nominee to become the european union 's justice and home affairs commissioner , rocco buttiglione said he was not aware of any violations .
" if this information is wrong , i 'll be the first one to denounce the situation , " buttiglione told the apcom news agency . unhcr waiting for access to refugees meanwhile on wednesday , the unhcr complained that italian authorities have not yet given the un agency clearance to the around 500 refugees who are still believed to be in lampedusa . " we are concerned because among the people who have been sent back , there were some who would perhaps have had the right to lodge a request for political asylum , " juergen humburg of the unhcr told afp . over the last two days alone , over a thousand would-be immigrants are said to have landed on italy 's southern coast .
one of the boats carrying the immigrants capsized off the coast of tunisia on monday , killing at least 22 people . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will have a chance to discuss the issue with libyan officials during a short visit on thursday .
berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa . " spain is not favorable to this kind of initiative , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said tuesday .
moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .
" what olli did was by no means ok , " raged bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we told olli that actions such as that endanger his reputation . "
even kahn 's goalkeeping coach and long-term friend , sepp maier , put the boot in .
" that was a stupid thing he did with klose , " maier told munich newspaper az .
" he should know that himself . "
bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .
kahn has a reputation for having a short fuse and he earned the unwanted nickname ' genghis kahn ' after a kung-fu kick attack on borussia dortmund 's stephane chapuisat in april 1999 .
but germany coach jürgen klinsmann was unaffacted by the incident claiming it was part and parcel of soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : something in your nose , miro ?
" i do not think two international team-mates going for one another should be blown up , " said klinsmann .
" it is an emotional moment that can happen in the match .
that will also happen two months before the world cup . "
klose and kahn will avoid one another when germany face iran on saturday in tehran with klinsmann opting to rest kahn and hand a starting chance to arsenal 's jens lehmann .
eager lehmann earlier this week , lehmann said he would be in goal for germany for the 2006 world cup campaign leaving bayern munich 's oliver kahn warming the substitutes ' bench .
the former borussia dortmund custodian vowed to put kahn in the shade during his match against iran .
" i am convinced that i will be in goal for the 2006 world cup , " insisted lehmann in magazine kicker .
" i am at the peak of my career in terms of experience and sporting ability . "
bayern shot-stopper kahn was stripped of the captaincy by klinsmann , with michael ballack favored , and lehmann believes his chances are improved with kahn no longer guaranteed a place in the starting line-up .
" the captain has to play so a goalkeeper as captain is not the best idea , " added lehmann .
" for me it was awful to be in competition with someone who has a 40 percent advantage because he is captain . "
kahn has been first choice goalkeeper for the german national team since the tail end of 1996 winning 74 caps while lehmann has just 19 .
but the arsenal goalkeeper dreams of lifting the world cup crown in germany and insists it is not too much to expect despite the disastrous first round exit at euro 2004 . " france are going through a transitional phase , " he explained .
" england , the netherlands and italy are hardly world beaters , although brazil are a very strong team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off negotiations at opel continue opinion : blame the managers , not the country business -pipe- 06.10.2004 germany 's crippled city centers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if big downtown stores go under , so could their smaller neighbors germany 's largest department store chain , karstadt , has announced it might close 77 of its stores , primarily in smaller cities and towns .
some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country . " we started seeing town centers begin emptying out in the mid 1990s , " beate glöckner of the irs institute for regional development and structural planning told dw-world .
" the trend has begun to accelerate . " now city planners and demographers fear that the karstadt closings could mean that vicious circle is about spread to even more municipalities . " it can be the beginning of the decay of a town 's infrastructure , " reiner klingholz , director of the berlin institute for world population and global development , told dw-world .
" certain shops close , windows are shuttered , and this makes the place unattractive , not just for shoppers and existing businesses , but for new businesses as well . " the karstadt store in the bavarian town of deggendorf is one of the outlets threatened with closure .
while the news has the store 's 120 employees worried about their careers , it also has surrounding businesses fearing for their own futures . " it 's terrible , " sait ögütmen , owner of a snack bar next to the department store , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" the whole square here will deteriorate . " the " wal-mart " effect in fact , more and more often in germany , new businesses are avoiding town centers and choosing to set up shop in the open countryside on the outskirts of town .
already , only around a third of retail establishments in germany are in town centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart stores in the united states do a booming business it 's a similar phenomenon to the wal-mart story in the united states .
now the world 's largest store chain , wal-mart embarked on a massive expansion course in the 1990s , setting up its warehouse-like stores in former farm fields , where it could offer customers plenty of free parking and a huge selection of merchandise , often at rock-bottom prices . the result , however , was that smaller mom-and-pop stores up and down main street in small-town america could not compete and were forced out of business .
today , many stores in traditional small town centers are boarded up while the real centers of retail activity have shifted to the conglomerations outside the town limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea store in germany germany is seeing a similar development and the success stories on the german retail landscape , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , electronics superstore mediamarkt or the booming home improvement stores are enthusiastically following the new concept . " they 've developed whole shopping centers , offering acres of parking and a conglomeration of stores close to one another , " blanek said .
" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .
" there are other possibilities they can use to bring shoppers back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medieval town centers , like this one in trier in western germany , offer a unique shopping experience he suggests that stores in town centers cooperate on several levels , such as harmonizing their opening hours , establishing special incentives for shoppers to come downtown , or redesigning their shopping areas to take advantage of the unique historical character of the area . " town centers have things to offer consumers that the big superstores centers out of town can not , " he said .
" the shopping experience is , you might say , more authentic .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .

pillaging of villages oric also faces charges related to the destruction of villages around srebrenica .
during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .

with an eye on upcoming national elections , the party has recruited prominent neo-nazis for top leadership positions . germany 's far-right national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which made headlines last month when it won 9.2 percent of the vote in regional elections in the eastern state of saxony , is pressing on with its efforts to enter the national government .
looking ahead to upcoming federal elections in 2006 , the npd has recruited two prominent neo-nazis for high-ranking leadership positions .

npd leader udo voigt is also scheduled to meet with gerhard frey , the leader of the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , another far right party that snagged 6.1 percent of the vote in brandenburg during the same regional elections , for talks focused on a possible alliance .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .
anyone who earns more than that can opt out .
this opt-out option presents a twofold risk , lauterbach said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with insurance , healthcare clients still have to shell out a copayment " on the one hand the groups engaged by the state to provide insurance lose premiums , " he said .
" on the other hand , the costs of illness have gotten so high that no one can afford to pay them alone . "
even people who earn very high salaries are effected when they opt out of insurance altogether , he said .
mess in the us lauterbach cited the united states as an example of the risks both individuals and society can take when health care is privatized .
some 120 million us citizens - 40 percent of the population - are either uninsured or underinsured .
of these , 44 million have no insurance protection whatsoever , while the rest are only partly insured .
" many us citizens ca n't afford adequate insurance and thus do n't get insurance for illnesses they may already have , " lauterbach said .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .
those reforms included abolishing the death penalty , eliminating state security courts , adopting a " zero-tolerance policy " toward torture and reigning in the power of the military , which has seized power in turkey several times in recent decades , " in conformity with democratic norms , " he said .
he also said turkey will join the international criminal court .
" we hope to bring a long-traveled road to its final lap with the initiation of accession negotiations in the first half of 2005 , " he told the parliamentary committee of the council of europe , a group formed in 1949 to promote human rights and democracy in europe , but with no formal link to the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with eu commission president romano prodi in brussels erdogan added that he hoped that the accession talks would not drag on indefinitely , reflecting turkey 's frustration at its perception that the european bloc has been hinting at membership for decades but hardly moving in that direction .
" turkish membership will not be achieved overnight , " he said but added that his government expects to " conclude this phase within a reasonable amount of time . "
a decade or more while the eu 's head office formally recommended in a report on wednesday that talks begin with turkey , eu heads of state will make the final decision at their dec .
17 summit .
but even if the decision is favorable to turkey soon , officials have suggested negotiations could last a decade or more .
president jacques chirac of france , who is hanoi , vietnam where he will attend an asia-europe summit , said the process was only at the very beginning .
" if the european commission decides in december to open those negotiations , everybody is aware that these negotiations could last at the minimum between 10 and 15 years , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish men fish on the galata bridge in istanbul , with the ottoman era new mosque in the background many europeans , including some commissioners , have reservations about admitting turkey , an overwhelmingly muslim country of 71 million , to the eu .
erdogan told reporters on wednesday that has said he understands the concerns the european commission might have about allowing turkey to join , but added that he does not expect special treatment .
" we expect to be subject to the same rules and conditions as other candidates , " he said .
german reaction in germany , opinion was split on the recommendation by the european commission that accession talks begin .
chancellor gerhard schröder , currently on a visit to india , said he welcomed the recommendation by the commission and that germany would vote yes at the december meeting .
foreign minister joschka fischer was also positive about the commission 's report , saying the time frame of 10 to 15 years until actual membership was realistic .
however , conservative leader angela merkel of the christian democrats , was less enthusiastic , saying her party prefers offering turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .
germany industry and trade associations hailed the progress toward membership talks as a positive development .
according to the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the german economy could benefit from turkey 's membership , especially since turkey is a growth economy with strong strategic potential for german firms .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .
whatever their income level , they have a choice of buying a state-run insurance plan , buying a private plan - or saving the money and going without insurance altogether .
top earners can opt out even company employees can opt out of the state run insurance schemes if the earn enough money to do so .
the current upper limit for compulsory insurance is a salary of € 3,862 -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- per month .
anyone who earns more than that can opt out .
this opt-out option presents a twofold risk , lauterbach said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with insurance , healthcare clients still have to shell out a copayment " on the one hand the groups engaged by the state to provide insurance lose premiums , " he said .
" on the other hand , the costs of illness have gotten so high that no one can afford to pay them alone . "
even people who earn very high salaries are effected when they opt out of insurance altogether , he said .
mess in the us lauterbach cited the united states as an example of the risks both individuals and society can take when health care is privatized .
some 120 million us citizens - 40 percent of the population - are either uninsured or underinsured .
of these , 44 million have no insurance protection whatsoever , while the rest are only partly insured .
" many us citizens ca n't afford adequate insurance and thus do n't get insurance for illnesses they may already have , " lauterbach said .
another case in point is the young , healthy americans who are in the middle of building up companies and families .
" they often have to opt to be uninsured purely on the basis of cost , " lauterbach said . " then if they get sick , it can lead to them losing their business .

more germans are risking it in germany , more and more people are opting to leave the state-run health insurance plans .
but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment . the possibility of opting out of public health insurance - thereby saving several hundreds of euros each month - is tempting for many .
increasingly , people who are self employed or run small businesses and find themselves in financial straits are taking advantage of this option , the german health ministry recently said .
more and more uninsured since 1995 , the number of self employed people that have neither state run nor private insurance has risen from 6,000 to 31,000 in 2003 .
this agrees with a nationwide trend ; some 188,000 people -lrb- whether self employed or not -rrb- had no insurance in germany in 2003 , up from 105,000 in 1995 .
while these numbers are relatively small , economists note than in neighboring european countries , the phenomenon of being uninsured is unknown .
and they warn of a us-like system which leaves huge numbers of citizens uninsured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lauterbach -lrb- right -rrb- and bert rürup , who headed a governmental commission to come up with health care system reforms " the possibility of entirely avoiding the solidarity system of health insurance simply does n't exist in the other eu countries , " karl lauterbach -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , an economist who advises the german government on health care policy , told dw-world .
" actually , in the netherlands you can get out of the compulsory state insurance system .
but then you are obligated to buy private insurance . "
protective laws data from 2001 assembled by the organization for economic cooperation and development , or oecd , show that the national health care systems in all of the then-member states guarantee basic health coverage , while in germany just 90 percent of the citizens were insured via the state-run system .
and the percentage of uninsured among the remaining 10 percent continues to grow .
in germany , there are laws governing who is eligible for state-run health insurance .
most employees and their family members must buy into an insurance plan .
students and people in job-training schemes - with few exceptions - also need to be insured .
" but compulsory insurance according to the law does n't apply to every citizen , " lauterbach said .
in general , those who are self-employed are exempt from compulsory insurance .

the healing power of storytelling culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.10.2004 frankfurt book fair opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations are underway for the start of the frankfurt book fair gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , opened the frankfurt book fair on tuesday .
chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .
bridging two worlds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the arab league will be this year 's special guests .
the organizers and their guests both expressed their hope that the book fair will help bring the arab and western worlds closer together at a time when conflict is rife .
more than 200 authors , artists and politicians from members of the arab league traveled to frankfurt , among them the palestinian mahmud darwish and moroccan tahar ben jelloun .
the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .
but , according to organizers , the presence of arab writers at this year 's book fair is not about increasing sales , but increasing understanding .
raising the profile of german-language writers in addition to the events highlighting the literature of arab countries , a new german book prize modeled on the pulitzer prize in the united states and the prix goncourt in france will be unveiled at this year 's event .
the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .
a jury of five literature experts will be responsible for selecting the winner , and the short list of the first five finalists will be released in september of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : open , sesame !
when the frankfurt book fair opens next week , the guest of honor will be the arab world .
the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures found near srebrenica these actions , in 1992 and 1993 , are seen by some as having played a role in fueling anti-muslim sentiment in the srebrenica enclave before the infamous massacre in july 1995 , the worst case of genocide in europe since world war ii .
pillaging of villages oric also faces charges related to the destruction of villages around srebrenica .
during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

naser oric is accused of overseeing the destruction of serb villages and the torture of prisoners . the 37-year-old oric is one of the few muslims facing trial alongside dozens of serb suspects .
his case has been especially sensitive since his crimes allegedly took place in the region around the town of srebrenica , where more then 7,000 muslim civilians were murdered by serb soldiers in 1995 .
oric , who was a police officer before the balkans war besides a bodyguard for milosevic , resurfaced in 1991 as a commander of muslim forces .
the un court in the hague says troops under his command destroyed 15 serb villages and subjected prisoners in eastern bosnia to physical abuse and beatings , including where people were beaten to death .
according to prosecutor jan wubben , who made the tribunal 's opening statement , oric approved of his men beating prisoners " with iron bars and wooden poles , the forced extraction of teeth and broken jaws . "
seven men allegedly died from the beatings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures found near srebrenica these actions , in 1992 and 1993 , are seen by some as having played a role in fueling anti-muslim sentiment in the srebrenica enclave before the infamous massacre in july 1995 , the worst case of genocide in europe since world war ii .
pillaging of villages oric also faces charges related to the destruction of villages around srebrenica .
during the siege of the town and surrounding area , fighters led by oric broke through serb lines and raided surrounding villages in search of weapons and food .
he is blamed by bosnian serbs for the murder of around 2,000 serbs from villages his troops plundered .
he is still seen by his supporters has a brave defender of srebrenica and was eventually awarded the bosnian army 's highest honor , the " golden lily , " for his actions there .
however , both he and un peacekeepers were unable to protect the inhabitants of the besieged region , which was eventually overrun by serb troops .
oric faces six counts of violating the rules and customs of war , including murder , cruel treatment , wanton destruction and plunder .
the charges against him are not directly related to the srebrenica massacre , although lawyers are likely to bring the issue up .

the refugees were said to have been deported within 24 to 48 hours of their arrival on the small island of lampedusa , closest to africa .
three other military transport planes were standing by to take a further 300 deportees back to libya during the afternoon . " inhumane " move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese immigrants appear from the german cap anamur aid ship as they dock in the sicilian harbour of porto empedocle , italy in july .
the un high commissioner for refugees as well as the italian opposition have described the large-scale expulsions as " inhumane . "
italian television broadcast graphic images of hundreds of handcuffed refugees in lampedusa herded by policeman into waiting military planes . " the immigrants have been treated without the slightest respect for international conventions , " pietro folena , parliamentarian and member of italy 's largest opposition party , democrats of the left -lrb- ds -rrb- told afp .
" italy 's reputation has been besmirched by an offense against human rights , " folena added . amnesty international and doctors without borders also slammed the deportation , saying it was a " grave violation " of national and international asylum laws . italian stance on refugees laura boldrini , unhcr spokeswoman said that the speeded up deportation process of refugees from lampedusa was shrouded in secrecy . boldrini said the italian authorities made no effort to differentiate between asylum-seeking candidates and economic refugees .
she also pointed out that the authorities did n't even possess equipment for carrying out identification measures such as fingerprints or photographs of the refugees . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu was quoted as saying , " the poor devils -lrb- the refugees -rrb- must know that they will get humanitarian help , but then will be sent back immediately to the place where they came from . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhausted african refugees lie in a boot near the italian island of lampedusa in oct .
2003 .
but , experts point out that italy 's hard-line stance against the refugees is problematic because the country still does n't have an asylum law .
that means there are no hard and fast time limits within which authorities are required to check whether refugees qualify as asylum-seekers . human rights group also say that though italy has signed the geneva refugee convention , libya , which serves as a transit and starting point for hundreds of refugees from africa , has n't .
thus , italy sends rejected refugees after a perfunctory check , back to a country where the basic standards of refugee rights are n't guaranteed , experts complain . in brussels on tuesday , italy 's nominee to become the european union 's justice and home affairs commissioner , rocco buttiglione said he was not aware of any violations .
" if this information is wrong , i 'll be the first one to denounce the situation , " buttiglione told the apcom news agency . unhcr waiting for access to refugees meanwhile on wednesday , the unhcr complained that italian authorities have not yet given the un agency clearance to the around 500 refugees who are still believed to be in lampedusa . " we are concerned because among the people who have been sent back , there were some who would perhaps have had the right to lodge a request for political asylum , " juergen humburg of the unhcr told afp . over the last two days alone , over a thousand would-be immigrants are said to have landed on italy 's southern coast .
one of the boats carrying the immigrants capsized off the coast of tunisia on monday , killing at least 22 people . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will have a chance to discuss the issue with libyan officials during a short visit on thursday .
berlusconi is going to libya for the opening of a gas pipeline linking the north african country to sicily . rome has identified libya as being the main launchpad for crossings by african migrants trying to reach europe via italy , and the government here has been pressing tripoli for more than a year to do more to stem the tide of would-be immigrants .
italy has promised libya equipment and training for land and sea patrols to help them cope , once the european union lifts a long-standing embargo , imposed for its support of international terrorism . spain opposes transit camps even as the refugee crisis continued in lampedusa , spain on tuesday said it opposed the idea of would-be immigrants to europe being accommodated in mass transit camps in north africa . " spain is not favorable to this kind of initiative , " spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said tuesday .
moratinos said the spanish government does not believe that setting up camps in libya and neighboring north african states such as morocco , tunisia and algeria can " improve the flow " of illegal immigrants .
he added that human rights and effective international cooperation on the issue were his prime concerns . the idea of setting up transit camps in north africa to process asylum applications outside the european union is favored by germany and italy .
the plan is to be discussed at a meeting of eu interior ministers later this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves refugee camp pilot schemes after debating proposals put forward by germany 's otto schily , the european commission has agreed to set up pilot schemes in five north african countries to cope with the influx of refugees heading to europe .

kahn claims klose landed a late blow to his kidney but television replays show no evidence .

bremen manager thomas schaaf was infuriarted by the incident and did not hold back in criticising kahn .
" that sort of action does not belong on the pitch and should not be accepted , " said schaaf .
kahn has a reputation for having a short fuse and he earned the unwanted nickname ' genghis kahn ' after a kung-fu kick attack on borussia dortmund 's stephane chapuisat in april 1999 .

karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .

some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country . " we started seeing town centers begin emptying out in the mid 1990s , " beate glöckner of the irs institute for regional development and structural planning told dw-world .
" the trend has begun to accelerate . " now city planners and demographers fear that the karstadt closings could mean that vicious circle is about spread to even more municipalities . " it can be the beginning of the decay of a town 's infrastructure , " reiner klingholz , director of the berlin institute for world population and global development , told dw-world .
" certain shops close , windows are shuttered , and this makes the place unattractive , not just for shoppers and existing businesses , but for new businesses as well . " the karstadt store in the bavarian town of deggendorf is one of the outlets threatened with closure .
while the news has the store 's 120 employees worried about their careers , it also has surrounding businesses fearing for their own futures . " it 's terrible , " sait ögütmen , owner of a snack bar next to the department store , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" the whole square here will deteriorate . " the " wal-mart " effect in fact , more and more often in germany , new businesses are avoiding town centers and choosing to set up shop in the open countryside on the outskirts of town .
already , only around a third of retail establishments in germany are in town centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart stores in the united states do a booming business it 's a similar phenomenon to the wal-mart story in the united states .
now the world 's largest store chain , wal-mart embarked on a massive expansion course in the 1990s , setting up its warehouse-like stores in former farm fields , where it could offer customers plenty of free parking and a huge selection of merchandise , often at rock-bottom prices . the result , however , was that smaller mom-and-pop stores up and down main street in small-town america could not compete and were forced out of business .
today , many stores in traditional small town centers are boarded up while the real centers of retail activity have shifted to the conglomerations outside the town limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea store in germany germany is seeing a similar development and the success stories on the german retail landscape , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , electronics superstore mediamarkt or the booming home improvement stores are enthusiastically following the new concept . " they 've developed whole shopping centers , offering acres of parking and a conglomeration of stores close to one another , " blanek said .
" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .
" there are other possibilities they can use to bring shoppers back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medieval town centers , like this one in trier in western germany , offer a unique shopping experience he suggests that stores in town centers cooperate on several levels , such as harmonizing their opening hours , establishing special incentives for shoppers to come downtown , or redesigning their shopping areas to take advantage of the unique historical character of the area . " town centers have things to offer consumers that the big superstores centers out of town can not , " he said .
" the shopping experience is , you might say , more authentic .

he emphasized turkey 's progress in fulfilling reform requirements of the eu . during erdogan 's talk before the council of europe in strasbourg on wednesday afternoon , he recited a long list of economic and political reforms that he said showed turkey was ready to enter into serious accession talks with the eu .

according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
eu officials have also not given a concrete date for turkey 's actual entry .
most estimates , though , indicate that ankara 's road to brussels will extend until well into the next decade , with 15 years the most likely target .
bumpy road to membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's been looking to join the eu for 40 years turkey , an official candidate since 1999 , has been waiting to join the european club for four decades .
but within the european bloc , turkish membership has been a controversial topic , with opinion divided on whether to accept a large , poor and predominantly muslim nation of 70 million with a patchy record on human rights .
" there is clearly the possibility that turkey can become a member , but the negotiations , and this is very important , are open-ended , " agriculture commissioner franz fischler said after the commission made its announcement .
" there is no more ground to be opposed fundamentally to the start of entry talks .
it is also clear that there is still a lot to do , " said fischler ahead of an official statement read in the european parliament .
the report noted ankara had made substantial progress in passing political reforms but still needed to improve implementation , notably in the fight against torture and the protection of fundamental liberties such as the freedom of expression and religion , and rights for women , trade unions and minorities .
" the commission will recommend the suspension of the negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the union is based , " it stated .
an emergency brake turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who was instrumental in pushing through policy reforms to bring his country in line with eu criteria for accession talks , voiced dismay at hints there would be an " emergency brake . "
prior to wednesday 's announcement he told deutsche welle that turkey had " done its homework " and it was now " up to the eu to uphold their end " and proceed with negotiations .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday also rejected any suggestion of " special conditions " for turkey and said the same criteria should apply to his country as to the 10 mostly eastern and southern european members who entered the bloc this past may .

according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .

" there is clearly the possibility that turkey can become a member , but the negotiations , and this is very important , are open-ended , " agriculture commissioner franz fischler said after the commission made its announcement .
" there is no more ground to be opposed fundamentally to the start of entry talks .

the report noted ankara had made substantial progress in passing political reforms but still needed to improve implementation , notably in the fight against torture and the protection of fundamental liberties such as the freedom of expression and religion , and rights for women , trade unions and minorities .
" the commission will recommend the suspension of the negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the union is based , " it stated .

some are worried that town centers that lose a major store will begin to atrophy . the major restructuring plan announced by the department store giant is aimed at putting an end to its financial freefall - the karstadtquelle group will have pre-tax losses of up to € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- this year .
but in getting itself out of the red by possibly shutting 43 percent of its stores , it could help to cripple entire town centers , which are heavily dependent on the big chain 's ability to lure consumers . " in many cities , the big stores function as magnets for shoppers , " jan blanek , a researcher at the urban planning institute at the university of stuttgart , told dw-world .
" when those shopping magnets pull out , a large number of customers stay away as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers are carrying around fewer bags these days that has serious ramifications for city centers that are already struggling to attract customers .
the weak national economy and planned reforms of the welfare system and labor market have spoiled the mood of many shoppers , who are staying away from stores in droves .
the closing of a major retail center , leaving a large hole at the heart of the town , would only exacerbate the problem . " when such a large store closes and no other business moves into the building , it can have a crippling effect with very serious consequences , not only for the population , but for the whole city , " gerd landsberg , head of the germany federation of cities and municipalities , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . accelerating a trend over the last decade , a vicious circle of atrophy has already begun in several medium-sized cities in germany , particularly in the eastern part of the country . " we started seeing town centers begin emptying out in the mid 1990s , " beate glöckner of the irs institute for regional development and structural planning told dw-world .
" the trend has begun to accelerate . " now city planners and demographers fear that the karstadt closings could mean that vicious circle is about spread to even more municipalities . " it can be the beginning of the decay of a town 's infrastructure , " reiner klingholz , director of the berlin institute for world population and global development , told dw-world .
" certain shops close , windows are shuttered , and this makes the place unattractive , not just for shoppers and existing businesses , but for new businesses as well . " the karstadt store in the bavarian town of deggendorf is one of the outlets threatened with closure .
while the news has the store 's 120 employees worried about their careers , it also has surrounding businesses fearing for their own futures . " it 's terrible , " sait ögütmen , owner of a snack bar next to the department store , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" the whole square here will deteriorate . " the " wal-mart " effect in fact , more and more often in germany , new businesses are avoiding town centers and choosing to set up shop in the open countryside on the outskirts of town .
already , only around a third of retail establishments in germany are in town centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wal-mart stores in the united states do a booming business it 's a similar phenomenon to the wal-mart story in the united states .
now the world 's largest store chain , wal-mart embarked on a massive expansion course in the 1990s , setting up its warehouse-like stores in former farm fields , where it could offer customers plenty of free parking and a huge selection of merchandise , often at rock-bottom prices . the result , however , was that smaller mom-and-pop stores up and down main street in small-town america could not compete and were forced out of business .
today , many stores in traditional small town centers are boarded up while the real centers of retail activity have shifted to the conglomerations outside the town limits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea store in germany germany is seeing a similar development and the success stories on the german retail landscape , such as swedish furniture giant ikea , electronics superstore mediamarkt or the booming home improvement stores are enthusiastically following the new concept . " they 've developed whole shopping centers , offering acres of parking and a conglomeration of stores close to one another , " blanek said .
" they 've been able to give consumers a new kind of shopping experience .
traditional stores like karstadt have not . " stemming the tide politicians of all stripes have been calling on the government to formulate a strategy to revitalize town centers as economic centers .
some have called on local politicians to stop issuing approval permits for large shopping centers built outside of town . but city planning researcher blanek does not think town centers are an endangered species just yet .
he said there are strategies that store owners and municipal governments can follow to keep the downtown retail drain from accelerating .
he said key is not trying to compete with the outlying superstores , but rather to offer consumers an attractive shopping alternative . " while the loss of the large magnet stores will be painful , town centers do not have to be solely dependent on them , " he said .
" there are other possibilities they can use to bring shoppers back . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medieval town centers , like this one in trier in western germany , offer a unique shopping experience he suggests that stores in town centers cooperate on several levels , such as harmonizing their opening hours , establishing special incentives for shoppers to come downtown , or redesigning their shopping areas to take advantage of the unique historical character of the area . " town centers have things to offer consumers that the big superstores centers out of town can not , " he said .
" the shopping experience is , you might say , more authentic .

according to a report published on wednesday , brussels backed beginning talks with ankara but warned a long road lies ahead . in a progress report presented to the european union on wednesday , the commission recommended opening membership talks with turkey , but left room for suspending or even breaking off talks at any point if unsatisfied with turkey 's progress .
the bloc 's executive linked the success of negotiations with a series of stipulations such as progress on human rights and implementing outstanding reforms in the legal system .
" the commission considers that turkey sufficiently fulfills the political criteria and recommends that accession negotiations be opened , " stated the report , which was endorsed by a large consensus among the commissioners .
the commission refused to say when accession talks would commence , leaving the final decision to eu leaders at a december 17 summit .
if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in early 2005 , capping years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
eu officials have also not given a concrete date for turkey 's actual entry .
most estimates , though , indicate that ankara 's road to brussels will extend until well into the next decade , with 15 years the most likely target .
bumpy road to membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's been looking to join the eu for 40 years turkey , an official candidate since 1999 , has been waiting to join the european club for four decades .
but within the european bloc , turkish membership has been a controversial topic , with opinion divided on whether to accept a large , poor and predominantly muslim nation of 70 million with a patchy record on human rights .
" there is clearly the possibility that turkey can become a member , but the negotiations , and this is very important , are open-ended , " agriculture commissioner franz fischler said after the commission made its announcement .
" there is no more ground to be opposed fundamentally to the start of entry talks .
it is also clear that there is still a lot to do , " said fischler ahead of an official statement read in the european parliament .
the report noted ankara had made substantial progress in passing political reforms but still needed to improve implementation , notably in the fight against torture and the protection of fundamental liberties such as the freedom of expression and religion , and rights for women , trade unions and minorities .
" the commission will recommend the suspension of the negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the union is based , " it stated .
an emergency brake turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , who was instrumental in pushing through policy reforms to bring his country in line with eu criteria for accession talks , voiced dismay at hints there would be an " emergency brake . "
prior to wednesday 's announcement he told deutsche welle that turkey had " done its homework " and it was now " up to the eu to uphold their end " and proceed with negotiations .
turkish foreign minister abdullah gul on monday also rejected any suggestion of " special conditions " for turkey and said the same criteria should apply to his country as to the 10 mostly eastern and southern european members who entered the bloc this past may .
european commission president romano prodi , speaking to reuters on the eve of his outgoing executive 's last major decision , played down the novelty of introducing an " emergency brake " to stop talks if ankara slipped on key standards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani prodi , european commission president " we have to be sure that turkey will be like any of the other member states in case they come in , " he said , insisting the commission would apply the same standards to ankara 's bid as it did to all previous applicants .
" do n't you think there were clearly built-in emergency brakes in all the negotiations we had ? " he said .
special conditions for turkey in its report the commission also recommended the eu consider implementing permanent safeguards that would curb migrant labor from turkey , as well as agree to " specific arrangements " before ankara benefits fully from eu farm subsidies and regional aid .
an impact study leaked to the press ahead of the commission 's announcement revealed that between 500,000 and four million turkish migrants a year could move into the rest of the eu after membership , and that yearly subsidies of between 16 and 28 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 to $ 34 billion -rrb- would be required to bring turkey 's agriculture and infrastructure up to par with the rest of the bloc .
despite these concerns , prodi said europe had no reason to fear turkey 's membership : " europe with a constitution , with strong institutions and affirmed policies for a strong model of peace and economic well being , has nothing to fear from the accession of turkey , " he told the european parliament . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth while turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan and the rest of turkey wait to hear from europe 's leaders , dw-world takes a look at the issues that effect the country 's connection to europe .

dw-world looks at how many of the big players see the issue . if the european commission 's recommendation is approved by the 25 eu leaders at the end of the year summit , entry talks could begin in late 2005 , bringing to head years of lobbying by turkish leaders who say their country could form a bridge between muslim countries and europe .
but the issue of turkish membership in the eu has been hotly debated both in brussels and in the member states .
here 's a look at what some of the key players in the debate have to say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan , left , and chancellor schröder germany - chancellor gerhard schröder 's government is one of the most vocal proponents of welcoming turkey into the bloc .
with one eye on germany 's 2.5 million turks , the coalition of social democrats and greens back voting for membership talks at the december summit .
just days ahead of the commission 's endorsement , schröder met with erdogan and gave him his word that " if the criteria will have been met , germany will vote in favor of accession talks . "
the opposition christian democrats and the christian social union oppose entry and are pushing instead to give turkey a " privileged partnership . "
they argue that the predominantly muslim country does not fit with european ideals .
a poll of 1,000 germans conducted for public broadcaster ard of sept .
28-29 found 55 percent of would support turkey joining the eu " in the medium to long term , " with 41 percent opposed .
surveys in the past have shown that a majority of germans oppose turkish membership .
france - president jacques chirac personally supports turkish entry , but his conservative union for a popular movement party is largely against it as is prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
in an attempt to quell the criticism , chirac has called for changing the french constitution to allow a referendum before turkey eventually joins .
the latest ipsos poll on sept .
24 showed 36 percent of voters support turkish entry now , 56 percent against and 8 percent without a response .
some 63 percent of the french said they could imagine turkey joining the eu in the future .
britain - prime minister tony blair 's labor government is " profoundly and absolutely committed to determining a start date for the negotiations in december , " foreign secretary jack straw said in september .
in the last several months , britain has argued tirelessly that turkey can help bridge differences between europe and the muslim world and aid in the fight against terrorism .
london has also opposed moves to put indefinite curbs on turkish workers migrating to the rest of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , with european union commission president romano prodi , right italy - prime minister silvio berlusconi warmly endorses turkey 's bid , but his government coalition is not necessarily united behind him .
the extreme conservative northern league has opposed starting negotiation talks with ankara as have senior vatican officials , who carry significant weight in the largely catholic country .
they have argued that the eu should focus on its christian roots .
a recent ipsos opinion poll showed 48 percent of italians supported turkish entry with 30 percent opposed .
some 22 percent were undecided or declined to answer .
netherlands - the current holder of the rotating eu presidency is largely in favor of letting turkey join .
the center-right coalition government and opposition both favor membership in principle .
dutch foreign minister bernard bot has said that negotiation talks could begin in late 2005 , but cautioned they could be broken off if the eu is unsatisfied with progress .
jozias van aartsen , leader of the liberal vvd party , has called for a referendum on turkish entry in 2016 or 2017 , dates realistically set for accession .
a september poll of 1,000 people found 41 percent against turkish entry and 21 percent in favor .
some 30 percent said they did n't care either way and 8 percent had no opinion .
austria - the alpine state is one of the most consistent opponents to membership .
at most , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said he would favor beginning talks only if the outcome does not include full membership .
he has gone on record calling for " reduced membership . "
the coalition partner freedom party is even more opposed to membership and has threatened to pull out of the government is schüssel backs opening talks in december .
a september gallup poll showed 76 percent against starting talks , 20 percent in favor and four percent undecided .
asked whether turkey could be ready for membership in the next 10 to 20 years , 68 percent said no , 27 percent yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. peacekeepers walk along the barbed wires and barrels that mark the " green line " which separates turkish and greek cypriot communities greece - conservative prime minister costas karamanlis is a strong supporter of turkey 's bid , continuing the rapprochement policy of his socialist predecessor , costas simitis .
karamanlis openly backs turkish accession talks despite the unresolved cyprus dispute .
except for fringe nationalist groups , all opposition parties also back turkey 's bid , seeing membership as a way to boost security and stability in the eastern mediterranean .
cyprus - although one of the newest eu members , the greek half of the divided island has voiced a strong position on turkey 's membership since becoming a full member in may 2004 .
greek cypriots generally oppose including ankara in the bloc , mainly out of strong historical dislike for the nation which has occupied a northern third of cyprus since 1974 .
greek cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has refrained from expressing his view , saying instead " vetoes are for the big guys . "
in july , 45 percent of greek cypriots polled for politis daily said they would back papadopoulos if he vetoed turkey 's bid in december .
spain and sweden as well as new members poland and latvia have also indicated that ankara could expect their support when the final decision is taken in december .

chancellor schröder welcomed his arab guests and stressed the importance creating a cultural dialogue . the 56th annual frankfurt book fair got underway on tuesday with more than 6,700 exhibitors from 110 countries gathering to present their latest literary offerings .
this year , the literature of the arab world will be the subject of special focus : the 22 members of the arab league - with the exception of libya , morocco , algeria , kuwait and iraq - are serving as special guests .
at the opening festivities , german chancellor gerhard schröder and amre mussa , the secretary general of the arab league , stressed the importance of using such events to foster a cultural dialogue between the arab and western worlds .
in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .
bridging two worlds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the arab league will be this year 's special guests .
the organizers and their guests both expressed their hope that the book fair will help bring the arab and western worlds closer together at a time when conflict is rife .
more than 200 authors , artists and politicians from members of the arab league traveled to frankfurt , among them the palestinian mahmud darwish and moroccan tahar ben jelloun .
the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .
but , according to organizers , the presence of arab writers at this year 's book fair is not about increasing sales , but increasing understanding .
raising the profile of german-language writers in addition to the events highlighting the literature of arab countries , a new german book prize modeled on the pulitzer prize in the united states and the prix goncourt in france will be unveiled at this year 's event .
the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .
a jury of five literature experts will be responsible for selecting the winner , and the short list of the first five finalists will be released in september of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : open , sesame !

in his speech , chancellor schröder rebuked those who continue to view the arab world through a lense of prejudice and preconceptions and heralded the arab country 's attendance at the book fair as a chance to set the record straight .
" those who rely on false assumptions should be prepared to differentiate their views , " said schröder .
" that 's the only way to foster understanding between different cultures - there is no better place for that to take place than at the frankfurt book fair . "
extra security precautions were taken to ensure that all goes smoothly at this year 's event , which will no doubt be dominated by political debate .
indeed , even the chancellor touched upon certain hot button issues in his opening remarks , mentioning both the situation in israel and in iraq .
bridging two worlds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the arab league will be this year 's special guests .
the organizers and their guests both expressed their hope that the book fair will help bring the arab and western worlds closer together at a time when conflict is rife .
more than 200 authors , artists and politicians from members of the arab league traveled to frankfurt , among them the palestinian mahmud darwish and moroccan tahar ben jelloun .
the nobel prize winning egyptian writer nagib machfus , however , could not attend due to health reasons , but has sent written remarks to be read aloud on his behalf .
the popularity of literature from arab countries has been on the rise , particularly in germany , where the number of books translated from arabic into german has jumped from 10 to 20 percent .
but , according to organizers , the presence of arab writers at this year 's book fair is not about increasing sales , but increasing understanding .
raising the profile of german-language writers in addition to the events highlighting the literature of arab countries , a new german book prize modeled on the pulitzer prize in the united states and the prix goncourt in france will be unveiled at this year 's event .
the prize is part of a larger effort to raise the profile of german writers .
meant to replace the award traditionally offered at the leipzig book fair , the new prize will come with a cash award of € 37,500 -lrb- $ 46,489 -rrb- .
a jury of five literature experts will be responsible for selecting the winner , and the short list of the first five finalists will be released in september of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : open , sesame !
when the frankfurt book fair opens next week , the guest of honor will be the arab world .
the event promises to be a success by drawing attention to a significant segment of world literature , as long as everyone joins in .
-lrb- october 2 , 2004 -rrb- book fair turns spotlight on arab literary talent many popular arab authors remain unknown in the west .
that may change as the frankfurt book fair invites the arab league as guest of honor this year .
but the nagging issue of censorship might not be touched upon at all .

here are key quotes from the confrontation in cleveland , ohio - as the republican incumbent and his democratic challenger candidates focused on international issues , notably iraq .
vice-president cheney : what we did in iraq was exactly the right thing to do .
if i had it to recommend all over again , i would recommend exactly the same course of action .
senator edwards : mr vice-president , you are still not being straight with the american people .
mr vice-president , there is no connection between the attacks of 11 september and saddam hussein .
the 9/11 commission has said it .
your own secretary of state has said it .
vice-president cheney : we 're four days away from a democratic election , the first one in history in afghanistan .
we 've got 10 million voters who have registered to vote , nearly half of them women ...
we 've made enormous progress in afghanistan .
senator edwards : here 's what 's actually happened in afghanistan , regardless of this rosy scenario that they paint on afghanistan , just like they do with iraq ...
not only are they -lrb- the afghans -rrb- providing 75 % of the world 's opium , large-cut parts of the country are under the control of drug lords and warlords .
vice-president cheney : if we want to win the war on terror , it seems to me it 's pretty clear the choice is george bush , not john kerry ...
a little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate can not obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defence issues .
senator edwards : when -lsb- dick cheney -rsb- was ceo of halliburton , they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company , just like enron .
they did business with libya and iran , sworn enemies of the united states .
vice-president cheney : it 's an effort that they made repeatedly to try to confuse the voters and to raise questions .
but there 's no substance of the charges .
the reason they keep trying to attack halliburton is because they want to obscure their own record .
vice-president cheney : first -lsb- john kerry and john edwards -rsb- voted to commit the troops , to send them to war ... then they came back and when the question was whether or not you provide them with the resources they needed - body armour , spare parts , ammunition - they voted against it .
i could n't figure out why that happened initially .
and then i looked and figured out that what was happening was howard dean was making major progress in the democratic primaries , running away with the primaries based on an anti-war record ...
now if they could n't stand up to the pressures that howard dean represented , how can we expect them to stand up to al-qaeda ?
senator edwards : we 've been largely absent , not entirely absent , but largely absent from the -lsb- middle east -rsb- peace-making process over the last four years .
vice-president cheney : the president stepped forward and put in place a policy basically that said we will support the establishment of two states -lsb- israel and a palestinian state -rsb- .
first president ever to say we 'll establish and support a palestinian state next door to israelis .
senator edwards : the reality about iran is that iran has moved forward with their nuclear weapons program on their watch .
they ceded responsibility to dealing with it to the europeans .
vice-president cheney : frankly , senator , you have a record that 's not very distinguished ...
you 've missed a lot of key votes : on tax policy , on energy , on medicare reform .
your hometown newspaper has taken to calling you ' senator gone . '
senator edwards : mr vice-president , i do n't think the country can take four more years of this type of experience .

it is believed to be the first time an education and library board has been ordered to pay the full cost of the therapy , which can cost up to £ 30,000 a year .
a bbc television crew has followed the footsteps of the murray family in dundonald for the last year , charting their efforts to get funding for the therapy , which they currently pay for themselves .
ruth is unemployed and her husband keith is an electrician , yet they have been paying out thousands to educate seven-year-old paul at home .
the therapy is called applied behaviour analysis -lrb- aba -rrb- and the family employs a rota of teachers in the home .
up to now , the south eastern education and library board had wanted paul to attend a school for severe learning disability .
the board said the therapy was not an efficient use of money .
tribunal appeal the murray family appealed to the special educational needs tribunal , which , in a landmark decision , has ordered the board to pay the whole cost of a year 's teaching .
in the past , some parents have won partial funding for their efforts to teach their autistic children with the therapy , but this is believed to be the first time that full funding has been granted .
the murrays say the cost of aba is decreasing and teaching their child will cost less than £ 17,000 a year .
however , they say the most cost-efficient way to provide it for more children who need it would be through an aba school .
the board says it will pay for paul 's education if it decides not to appeal the tribunal decision .
it is already anticipating that more parents will want similar funding for their children , and has now asked the department of education to pay for it .
own money for years now , the success of some children 's treatment with aba has encouraged families across northern ireland to pay large amounts of their own money for it .
they have employed therapists in their own homes and made huge sacrifices to help their autistic children progress .
in some cases , education and library boards have paid contributions towards the costs , but this tribunal decision is likely to give hope to families that the authorities will be forced to foot the entire bill .
however , some autism experts point out that aba is not the only successful therapy and that it will not suit all children .
they say it may also require extra elements to ensure a rounded education .
a university of ulster behaviour analyst said the decision to fund paul 's therapy marked a turning point in the services available to families with autistic children in northern ireland .
dr mickey keenan , of the university 's school of psychology , has campaigned for the development of aba in northern ireland and said he welcomed the murray family 's victory .
" this is a breakthrough decision .
it opens up hope to parents all over northern ireland , who have been campaigning and lobbying for public support for aba to be made available to help their children , " he said .

paul 's mother ruth campaigned for teaching at home it is believed to be the first time an education and library board has been ordered to pay the full cost of the therapy , which can cost up to £ 30,000 a year .
a bbc television crew has followed the footsteps of the murray family in dundonald for the last year , charting their efforts to get funding for the therapy , which they currently pay for themselves .
ruth is unemployed and her husband keith is an electrician , yet they have been paying out thousands to educate seven-year-old paul at home .
the therapy is called applied behaviour analysis -lrb- aba -rrb- and the family employs a rota of teachers in the home .
up to now , the south eastern education and library board had wanted paul to attend a school for severe learning disability .
the board said the therapy was not an efficient use of money .
tribunal appeal the murray family appealed to the special educational needs tribunal , which , in a landmark decision , has ordered the board to pay the whole cost of a year 's teaching .
the board expects similar applications from other families in the past , some parents have won partial funding for their efforts to teach their autistic children with the therapy , but this is believed to be the first time that full funding has been granted .
the murrays say the cost of aba is decreasing and teaching their child will cost less than £ 17,000 a year .
however , they say the most cost-efficient way to provide it for more children who need it would be through an aba school .
the board says it will pay for paul 's education if it decides not to appeal the tribunal decision .
it is already anticipating that more parents will want similar funding for their children , and has now asked the department of education to pay for it .
own money for years now , the success of some children 's treatment with aba has encouraged families across northern ireland to pay large amounts of their own money for it .
they have employed therapists in their own homes and made huge sacrifices to help their autistic children progress .
in some cases , education and library boards have paid contributions towards the costs , but this tribunal decision is likely to give hope to families that the authorities will be forced to foot the entire bill .
however , some autism experts point out that aba is not the only successful therapy and that it will not suit all children .
they say it may also require extra elements to ensure a rounded education .
a university of ulster behaviour analyst said the decision to fund paul 's therapy marked a turning point in the services available to families with autistic children in northern ireland .
dr mickey keenan , of the university 's school of psychology , has campaigned for the development of aba in northern ireland and said he welcomed the murray family 's victory .
" this is a breakthrough decision .
it opens up hope to parents all over northern ireland , who have been campaigning and lobbying for public support for aba to be made available to help their children , " he said .

researchers found taking hrt containing the hormones oestrogen and progestin doubled the risk of venous thrombosis for all women who took it for five years .
however , the risk was significantly higher still for older women , and those who were overweight or obese .
the research , by the university of vermont , is published in the journal of the american medical association . "
you have to weigh all the risks of taking it , and of not taking it . "
dr mary cushman however , experts have cast doubt on its relevance to the uk , where many women never take the treatment for as long as five years .
the study is based on an analysis of data from 16,608 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50 and 79 .
the researchers found that venous thrombosis occurred in 167 women taking combined hrt , compared with just 76 who were taking a dummy pill .
women aged 60 to 69 were 4.3 times more likely to develop a clot if taking combined hrt , while women in their seventies were at 7.5 times the risk .
the risk of a blood clot also increased sharply for overweight and obese women taking combined hrt .
for overweight women the risk was 3.8 times higher than those of normal weight , and for obese women it was 5.6 times higher .
the researchers calculated that over a 10 year period combined hrt would be responsible for an extra 18 cases of venous thrombosis if taken by 1,000 women .
a venous thrombosis is a type of blood clot which can travel to the lungs , and potentially cause life-threatening complications .
explain the risks lead researcher dr mary cushman told bbc news online the findings did not necessarily mean that combined hrt should not be offered to certain groups of women .
rather it was important that the risks and benefits were fully explained before they started on a course of treatment .
" you have to weigh all the risks of taking it , and of not taking it , " she said .
" combined hrt is still often the best form of treatment for a 55-year-old women who is suffering from hot flashes . "
it is thought that the hormones contained in hrt may increase the risk of a blood clot by interfering with the body 's clotting mechanism .
most women taking hrt in the uk use a combined version .
an oestrogen-only form is available , but is usually only given to women who have had a hysterectomy .
combined hrt has previously been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and stroke .
june davison , of the british heart foundation , said previous research had also shown that hrt might increase the risk of venous thrombosis , but she said the new work highlighted the fact that overweight women were particularly vulnerable .
" this implies that maintaining a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet and regular physical activity is particularly important for these women .
" hrt has many benefits , including reducing risk of osteoporosis and relieving unpleasant symptoms of the menopause .
" anyone concerned about taking hrt should discuss it with their doctor before making any changes to their medication . "
study flawed karen winterhalter , executive director of women 's health concern , which advises women on hormone replacement , said : " basically the whole study is flawed as the women were much older than the population of women who receive hrt in the uk .
" as they were an older age group they were prone to cardiovascular complications , as you would see with any older populations . "
in britain , women go on hrt for an average of two years , between the ages of 50 and 52 .
most have the treatment to alleviate menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes .
but some take it for longer , because hrt is known to protect against osteoporosis .
however , dr sarah jarvis , spokeswoman for the royal college of gps , said : " this confirms long-running concerns over hrt drugs .
" while they can offer short-term relief , hrt drugs should only be offered in the lowest doses and for the shortest time possible .
" the problem is often , when women stop hrt , the symptoms come back .
" my advice to patients is they should consider herbal alternatives such as black cohosh or red clover .
" one thing is clear - more research needs to be done in this area . "

study flawed karen winterhalter , executive director of women 's health concern , which advises women on hormone replacement , said : " basically the whole study is flawed as the women were much older than the population of women who receive hrt in the uk .
" as they were an older age group they were prone to cardiovascular complications , as you would see with any older populations . "
in britain , women go on hrt for an average of two years , between the ages of 50 and 52 .
most have the treatment to alleviate menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes .
but some take it for longer , because hrt is known to protect against osteoporosis .
however , dr sarah jarvis , spokeswoman for the royal college of gps , said : " this confirms long-running concerns over hrt drugs .
" while they can offer short-term relief , hrt drugs should only be offered in the lowest doses and for the shortest time possible .
" the problem is often , when women stop hrt , the symptoms come back .
" my advice to patients is they should consider herbal alternatives such as black cohosh or red clover .
" one thing is clear - more research needs to be done in this area . "

the anti-eu party has pledged to fight almost every constituency at the general election expected in may .
but paul sykes , who has donated £ 1.4m , thinks ukip will achieve little more than unseat eurosceptic tory mps .
nigel farage , ukip 's leader in the european parliament , said the news was a " blow " but mep robert kilroy-silk said other donors were offering money .
trust speech ukip 's would-be leader robert kilroy-silk 's declaration he wanted to " kill " the tories is understood to have been the final straw for mr sykes , who has twice left the conservative party because of its policy on europe .
coming just days after ukip pushed the tories into a humiliating fourth place in the hartlepool by-election , mr sykes ' declaration will boost michael howard as he prepares for his first conference speech as leader .
the thing is not to buy off people who are thinking of voting for ukip william hague ex-tory leader profile : paul sykes mr howard will say the party must not make promises it can not keep and pledge to sack ministers who fail to deliver .
mr sykes told bbc radio 4 's today programme there was little chance in a first past the post voting system in ukip getting any number of mps elected .
" there is only one major party now that is anti-brussels , that is for repatriating powers , " he said .
" i am at least warming to what i am hearing from the conservative party and i have no intention whatsoever of upsetting their applecart . "
mr sykes said the tories now seemed to be " waking up to the fact that it is not a bad idea to make our own laws in our own parliament by our own people , rather than importing them from unelected brussels " .
but he said he had not decided to fund the tories and denied negotiating with the conservative leadership .
carried away ?
ukip mep mr farage said the party had lost sight of its key objective amid the euphoria over recent election results .
" we have never been about ukip as a party , as a tribe , being the most important thing , " he told today .
redwood says he has been arguing the tory case with sykes " the most important thing to us is we get out of the eu and get back to a simply free trade agreement . "
mr farage also rebuffed mr kilroy-silk 's leadership ambitions , saying there was no appetite for " any kind of internecine warfare " .
leadership wrangle however , mr kilroy-silk told the bbc he was " relaxed " about mr sykes ' decision , saying that they had other people offering ukip funding .
he said he was a personal friend of mr sykes , pointing out that they and their wives were lunching on tuesday .
mr kilroy-silk did not rule out mr sykes funding ukip again , and said he believed the businessman would still fund his own personal election campaign .
the former television presenter said the party had to decide on its leadership .
but he was " not quite sure " current leader roger knapman had done a good job , saying the party would have a full range of policies if he had been doing the job himself .
he criticised mr knapman for using former clinton aide , bill morris , " a foreign adviser as a crutch " .
and he accused mr farage of a " slur " on ukip members over their decision to contest every constituent .
changing loyalties mr sykes gave money to tory eurosceptic candidates at the 1997 election .
a year later he pledged £ 20m to the democracy movement , an amalgamation of his own anti-euro currency campaign and the referendum movement - set up by the late sir james goldsmith .
former conservative leader william hague told today : " he -lsb- mr sykes -rsb- likes maximum dramatic effect for minimum expenditure and that 's fine but it does mean he changes from time to time . "
mr hague said ukip voters could be convinced they did not want to help elect a labour government .
" the thing is not to buy off people who are thinking of voting for ukip by a change of policy , " he said .
' wisdom ' a " delighted " tory deregulation spokesman john redwood said he had been talking to mr sykes in recent weeks but denied he had offered him any concessions .
he told today : " it is one thing to vote ukip in a proportional representation election ... -lsb- but -rsb- they realise in a general election they would n't get anybody elected , all they could do is mess us up . "
education spokesman tim collins told the tory conference on tuesday that ukip would not win a single seat at the general election .
urging ukip voters to " come home " to the conservatives , he said : " do n't just hope for a eurosceptic government , vote for one . "
warning of the ukip threat at an earlier fringe event , shadow home secretary david davis suggested the referendum party had cost the tories 30 to 50 seats at the last election .
labour cabinet office minister ruth kelly said the tories had given up on being a one nation party and were " lurching to the right " .

the company added that its landline talktalk service had added 137,000 customers in the quarter , and now had 648,000 users in the uk .
" trading over the first half has been ahead of our expectations , " said chief executive charles dunstone .
" the mobile market remains buoyant and we have achieved further good growth in both subscription and pre-pay connections . "
subscription connections rose by 18.3 % compared with a year ago while pre-pay connections grew by 29.8 % .
mr dunstone added that he expected half-year pre-tax profits to be " at least £ 27m , after significant investment in talktalk marketing costs " .
the firm said these marketing costs meant the talktalk business - which recently launched in spain and germany - was expected to chalk up a £ 6m interim loss .
